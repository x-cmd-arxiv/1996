  September 1996 , revised version with minor style changes, uses sprocl.sty",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The apparent Lorentz invariance of the laws of physics does not imply that
space-time is indeed minkowskian. We consider a scenario where Lorentz
invariance is only an approximate property of equations of matter above a
certain distance scale, and superluminal sectors of matter exist related to new
degrees of freedom not yet discovered experimentally. The new particles would
not be tachyons: they may feel different minkowskian space-times with critical
speeds much higher than c (speed of light) and behave kinematically like
ordinary particles apart from the difference in critical speed. Superluminal
particles may provide most of the matter at cosmic scale, and be mainly dark.
We present a discussion of possible theoretical, cosmological and experimental
consequences of such a scenario, with particular emphasis on problems related
to the identification of dark matter.

galaxies to obtain a yardstick, which could then be used to determine
cosmological parameters. This yardstick relies on the assumptions of
hydrostatic equilibrium and that the gas fraction is approximately constant.
The constancy is checked empirically from a local population of clusters. By
using the observed parameters consisting of temperature, surface brightness and
radial profile $\beta$, one can calculate the expected core radius. Comparing
it to the observed angular size, one can in principle calibrate the
cosmological deceleration parameter $q_0$. We test this method on a small
sample of 6 clusters, and show its promise and accuracy. The preliminary
implications would be to suggest $q_0 \approx 0.85\pm 0.29$ with $1-\sigma$
statistical error bars, with several systematic uncertainties remaining. Taken
at face value, this would argue against a cosmological constant. The method is
robust to errors in the measurement of the core radius as long as the product
of the central density and the core radius squared $\rho_0 r_c^2$ are well
determined. New lensing and X-ray data can dramatically improve on the
statistics.

are investigated by means of linear stability analysis. The equation of motion
for the pressure field (growth law) results to be that of the directional
solidification problem in some unsteady state. At the beginning of lifting the
square of the wavenumber of the dominant mode results to be proportional to the
lifting rate (in qualitative agreement with the experimental data), to the
square of the length of the cell occupied by the more viscous fluid, and
inversely proportional to the cube of the cell gap. This dependence on the cell
parameters is significantly different of that found in the standard cell.

of the affine sl(2|1) superalgebra. We then construct sl(2|1) representations
out of the fields of the non-critical N=2 string. This allows us to extend
naturally to sl(2|1) several crucial properties of the N=2 superconformal
algebra, first of all the construction of extremal states (an analogue of
different pictures for non-free fermions) and the spectral flow transform
(which then affects the Liouville sector). We further evaluate the affine
sl(2|1) singular vectors in the realization of sl(2|1) provided by the N=2
string. We establish that, with a notable exception, the respective singular
vectors are in a 2:1 correspondence, namely two different sl(2|1) singular
vectors evaluate as an N=2 superconformal singular vector (however, those
singular vectors that are labelled by a pair of positive integers get these
integers transposed under the reduction). We also analyse the `exceptional'
cases, which amount to a series of sl(2|1) singular vectors, labelled by r>=1,
which do not have an N=2 counterpart, and discuss the mechanism by which the
multiplicity of singular vectors becomes equal to two at certain points in the
weight spaces of both algebras.
