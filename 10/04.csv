construction of Kronheimer of moduli spaces $X_\zeta$ of translation-invariant

are proved: for $\zeta=0$, $X_0$ is isomorphic to $\C^n/\Gamma$; if $\zeta\neq
0$, the natural maps $X_\zeta\to X_0$ are partial resolutions. The moduli
$X_\zeta$ are furthermore shown to admit K\""ahler metrics which are
Asymptotically Locally Euclidean (ALE). A description of the singularities of

smooth for generic choices of the parameter $\zeta$. Related open problems in
higher-dimensional complex geometry are also mentioned. The paper has a

given. This produced varieties $X_\zeta$ (parameterised by $\zeta\in\Q^N$)

the same $X_\zeta$ can be described as moduli spaces of representations of the
McKay quiver associated to the action of $\Gamma$. It it shown that, for
abelian groups, $X_\zeta$ are toric varieties defined by convex polyhedra which
are the solution sets for a generalisation of the transportation problem on the
McKay quiver. The generalised transportation problem is solved for an arbitrary
quiver to give a description of the extreme points, faces, and tangent cones to
the solution polyhedra in terms of certain distinguished trees in the quiver.
Applied the McKay quiver, this gives an explicit procedure for calculating
$X_\zeta $, its Euler number, and its singularities for any $\zeta$. The
$\zeta$-parameter-space is thus partitioned into a finite disjoint union of
cones inside which the biregular type of $X_\zeta$ remains constant. Finally,
the example $\C^3/\Z_5$ (weights $1,2,3$) is worked out in detail, and figures
of smooth and singular $X_\zeta$ and their corresponding flows are drawn. A
further example of smooth crepant resolution $X_\zeta$ is drawn for the

the 60 micron 1.2 Jy IRAS redshift survey of Fisher et al. (1995) as a distance
indicator; equivalently, we compare the flux density distribution of galaxies
as a function of redshift with predictions under different redshift-distance
cosmologies, under the assumption of a universal luminosity function. This
method does not assume a uniform distribution of galaxies in space. We find
that this test has rather weak discriminatory power, as argued by Petrosian
(1993), and the differences between models are not as stark as one might expect
a priori. Even so, we find that the Hubble law is indeed more strongly
supported by the analysis than is the quadratic redshift-distance relation. We
identify a bias in the the Segal et al. determination of the luminosity
function, which could lead one to mistakenly favor the quadratic
redshift-distance law. We also present several complementary analyses of the
density field of the sample; the galaxy density field is found to be close to
homogeneous on large scales if the Hubble law is assumed, while this is not the
case with the quadratic redshift-distance relation.

of the dynamical defects in the ballistic metallic point contact. The upper
energy states of the ``dressed'' defect are shown to give a smaller
contribution to a resistance of the contact than the lower energy ones. This
holds both for the ""classical"" renormalization related to defect coupling with
average local electron density and for the ""mesoscopic"" renormalization caused
by the mesoscopic fluctuations of electronic density the dynamical defects are
coupled with. In the case of mesoscopic renormalization one may treat the
dynamical defect as coupled with Friedel oscillations originated by the other
defects, both static and mobile. Such coupling lifts the energy degeneracy of
the states of the dynamical defects giving different mesoscopic contribution to
resistance, and provides a new model for the fluctuator as for the object
originated by the electronic mesoscopic disorder rather than by the structural
one. The correlation between the defect energy and the defect contribution to
the resistance leads to zero-temperature and zero-bias anomalies of the point
contact resistance.
  A comparison of these anomalies with those predicted by the Two Channel Kondo
Model (TCKM) is made. It is shown, that although the proposed model is based on

information theory but is based entirely on density matrices, rather than
probability distributions, for the description of quantum ensembles. We find
that, unlike in Shannon theory, conditional entropies can be negative when
considering quantum entangled systems such as an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair,
which leads to a violation of well-known bounds of classical information
theory. Negative quantum entropy can be traced back to ``conditional'' density
matrices which admit eigenvalues larger than unity. A straightforward
definition of mutual quantum entropy, or ``mutual entanglement'', can also be
constructed using a ``mutual'' density matrix. Such a unified
information-theoretic description of classical correlation and quantum
entanglement clarifies the link between them: the latter can be viewed as
``super-correlation'' which can induce classical correlation when considering a

yangians are presented. The corresponding linear and quadratic $R$-brackets
include the dynamical $r$-matrices.
