lying between 0.01 and 9 pc from the central active nucleus. The Ginga X-ray
data are consistent with several possibilities: a warm absorber and a cold
absorber combined either with partial covering or an unusually strong
reflection spectrum. We present ROSAT observations of NGC3516 which show a
strong detection of a warm absorber dominated by a blend of OVII/OVIII edges at
$\sim$ 0.8 keV with nh $\sim 7\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and U: 8--12. We argue
that NGC3516 contains an outflowing `XUV' absorber showing the presence of
X-ray absorption edges, that are consistent with the presence of broad
absorption lines in the old IUE spectra and their disappearance in the new UV
observations. Our dynamical model suggests that the OVII absorption edge will
continue to weaken compared to the OVIII edge, an easily testable prediction
with future missions like AXAF. Eventually the source would be transparent to
the X-rays unless a new absorption system is produced.

mass X-ray binary 4U 0614+091 in observations with XTE. The observations span
several months and sample the source over a large range of X-ray luminosity. In
every interval QPOs are present above 400 Hz with fractional RMS amplitudes
from 3 to 12%. At high count rates, two high frequency QPOs are detected
simultaneously. The difference of their frequency centroids is consistent with
323 Hz in all observations. During one interval a third signal is detected at
328 +/- 2 Hz. This suggests the system has a stable `clock' which is most
likely the neutron star with spin period 3.1 msec. Thus, our observations and
those of another neutron star system by Strohmayer et al. (1996) provide the
first evidence for millisecond pulsars within low-mass X-ray binary systems and
reveal the `missing-link' between millisecond radiopulsars and the late stages
of binary evolution in low mass X-ray binaries (Alpar et al. 1982). We suggest
that the kinematics of the magnetospheric beat-frequency model (Alpar and
Shaham 1985) applies to these QPOs. In this interpretation the high frequency
signal is associated with the Keplerian frequency of the inner accretion disk
and the lower frequency `beat' signal arises from the differential rotation
frequency of the inner disk and the spinning neutron star. Assuming the high
frequency QPO is a Keplerian orbital frequency for the accretion disk, we find
a maximum mass of 1.9 solar masses and a maximum radius of 17 km for the
neutron star.

lane obscuring the nucleus of the galaxy, which was previously thought to be an
edge-on accretion disk feeding the AGN, is not centered on the nucleus. It is
unlikely that this is a stable configuration, suggesting that the material has
only recently entered the nuclear region. The nucleus is contained within a
cluster of stars having a total luminosity of order 5x10^7 L_0. Fitting a King

radius of 14 pc. The morphology apparent in the forbidden-line images of the

the boundary of a relatively dense cocoon of gas in the disk of the galaxy. The
emission-line regions are concentrated along the inner borders of dust
filaments, supporting the view that the nuclear jet is ramming into and

angular power spectrum of the distortion, and the power spectrum of density
fluctuations to non-flat cosmologies. We then compute $P_\psi$ for various
illustrative models. A useful cosmological discriminator is the growth of
$P_\psi$ with source redshift which is much stronger in low matter density
models, and especially in $\Lambda$-dominated models. With even crude redshift
information (say from broad band colours) it should be possible to constrain
the cosmological world model. The amplitude of $P_\psi(\omega)$ is also quite
sensitive to the cosmology, but requires a reliable external normalisation for
the mass fluctuations. If one normalises to galaxy clustering, with $M/L$ fixed
by small-scale galaxy dynamics, then low density models predict a much stronger
distortion. If, however, one normalises to large-scale bulk-flows, the
predicted distortion for sources at redshifts $Z_s \sim 1-3$ is rather
insensitive to the background cosmology. The signals predicted here can be
detected at a very high level of significance with a photometric survey
covering say 10 square degrees, but sparse sampling is needed to avoid large
sampling variance and we discuss the factors influencing the design of an
optimum survey. Turning to weak lensing by clusters we find that for high lens
redshifts ($Z_l\simeq1$) the critical density is substantially reduced in
$\Lambda$ models, but that the ratio of the shear or convergence to the
velocity dispersions or X-ray temperature of clusters is only very weakly
dependent on the cosmology.

their strong H-alpha emission -- which classifies them as classical T Tauri

turned out to be a likely chance projection with the `primary' showing neither
H-alpha emission nor Li absorption. Using the spectral A index (as defined by
Kirkpatrick et al. 1991), which measures the strength of the CaH band at
697.5nm relative to the nearby continuum, as a luminosity class indicator, we
could show that the classical T Tauri stars in our sample tend to be close to
luminosity class V. Eight out of the 14 pairs could be placed on an H-R
diagram. A comparison with theoretical pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks
yields that for all pairs the individual components appear to be coeval within
the observational errors. This finding is similar to Hartigan et al. (1994) who
detected that two third of the wider pairs with separations from 400 AU to 6000
AU are coeval. However, unlike Hartigan et al. for the wider pairs, we find no
non-coeval pairs among our sample. Thus, the formation mechanism for a
significant fraction of the wider pre-main-sequence binaries might be different
from that of closer pre-main-sequence binaries. All of the latter appear to
have formed simultaneously.

continuous degeneracy in q which is of order $\delta_d^{-1}$, where $\delta_d$

degeneracy in q is considerably less severe, and is typically less than a

maximum is explained from the interplay of the crossover phenomenon with the
deconfinement transition occurring due to the finite extension of the lattice.
We find, that for lattices of size $8^4$ and larger the crossover peak is
independent of lattice size at $\beta_{co}=2.23(2)$ and has a peak height of
$C_{V,co}=1.685(10)$. We conclude therefore that the crossover peak is not the
result of an ordinary phase transition. Further, the contributions to $C_V$

parallel plaquette correlations is different. To estimate the finite
temperature influence on symmetric lattices far off the deconfinement

(non co-commutative) Hopf algebra, hence a finite dimensional quantum group. By
selecting a system of explicit generators, we show how it is related with the
quantum enveloping algebra of SLq(2) when the parameter q is a cubic root of
unity. We describe its indecomposable projective representations as well as the
irreducible ones. We also comment about the relation between this object and
the theory of modular representations of the group SL(2,F3), i.e. the binary
tetrahedral group. Finally, we briefly discuss its relation with the Lorentz
group and, as already suggested by A.Connes, make a few comments about the
possible use of this algebra in a modification of the Standard Model of
particle physics (the unitary group of the semi-simple algebra associated with
H is U(3) x U(2) x U(1)).

treated classically, describes much of observed nuclear structure and has been
employed to describe the nuclear equation of state up to the quark-gluon phase
transition. The acceleration of the meson sources, for example, in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions, should result in bremsstrahlung-like radiation of the
meson fields. The many mesons emitted serve to justify the use of classical
meson fields. The slowing of the nuclei during the collision is modeled here as
a smooth transition from initial to final velocity. Under ultra-relativistic
conditions, vector radiation dominates. The angular distribution of energy flux
shows a characteristic shape. It appears that if the vector meson field couples
to the conserved baryon current, independent of the baryonic degrees of
freedom, this mechanism will contribute to the radiation seen in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions. The possible influence of the quark-gluon plasma is also
considered.

physically realizable. However, they can be truncated in both space and time
and approximated by means of a finite aperture radiator so to get a large
