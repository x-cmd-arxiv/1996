elements such as voids, clusters, filaments, and sheets. This network is
spanned by a point distribution. The global properties of the point process can
be measured by different statistical methods, which, however, do not describe
directly the structure elements. The morphology of structure elements is an
important property of the point distribution. Here we apply the core-sampling
method to various Voronoi tessellations. Using the core-sampling method we
identify one- and two-dimensional structure elements (filaments and sheets) in
these Voronoi tessellations and reconstruct their mean separation along random
straight lines. We compare the results of the core-sampling method with the a
priori known structure elements of the Voronoi tessellations under
consideration and find good agreement between the expected and found structure
parameters, even in the presence of substantial noise. We conclude that the
core-sampling method is a potentially powerful tool to investigate the
distribution of such structure elements like filaments and walls of galaxies.

differences between unconventional and conventional anisotropic superconductors
are illustrated by the unique effects that impurities have on the
low-temperature transport properties of unconventional superconductors. For
special classes of unconventional superconductors the low-temperature transport
coefficients are {\it universal}, i.e. independent of the impurity
concentration and scattering phase shift. The existence of a universal limit
depends on the symmetry of the order parameter and is achieved at low
temperatures $k_B T \ll \gamma \ll \Delta_0$, where $\gamma$ is the bandwidth
of the impurity induced Andreev bound states. In the case of UPt$_3$ thermal
conductivity measurements favor an $E_{1g}$ or $E_{2u}$ ground state.
Measurements at ultra-low temperatures should distinguish different pairing
states.

some new ideas that solve them is presented. Problems with causality violating
solutions of the wave equation and of the electron equation of motion, and
problems with the non-integrable singularity of its self-field energy tensor
are well known. The correct interpretation of the two (advanced and retarded)
Lienard-Wiechert solutions are in terms of creation and annihilation of
particles in classical physics. They are both retarded solutions. Previous work
on the short distance limit of CED of a spinless point electron are based on a
faulty assumption which causes the well known inconsistencies of the theory: a
diverging self-energy (the non-integrable singularity of its self-field energy
tensor) and a causality-violating third order equation of motion (the
Lorentz-Dirac equation). The correct assumption fixes these problems without
any change in the Maxwell's equations and let exposed, in the zero-distance
limit, the discrete nature of light: the flux of energy from a point charge is
discrete in time. CED cannot have a true equation of motion but only an
effective one, as a consequence of the intrinsic meaning of the Faraday-Maxwell
concept of field that does not correspond to the classical description of
photon exchange, but only to the smearing of its effects in the space around
the charge. This, in varied degrees, is transferred to QED and to other field
theories that are based on the same concept of fields as space-smeared
interactions.
