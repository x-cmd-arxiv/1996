The integrated CO intensity correlates Strongly with the 100 micron flux
density, as expected for a black body model in which the mid and far IR
radiation are optically thick. We use this model to derive sizes of the FIR and
CO emitting regions and the enclosed dynamical masses. Both the IR and CO
emission originate in regions a few hundred parsecs in radius. The median value
of Lfir/Lco = 160 Lsun/(K-km/s-pc^2), within a factor of two of the black body

of a normal galactic disk with densities a factor of 100 higher, making even
the intercloud medium a molecular region. Using three different techniques of
H2 mass estimation, we conclude that the ratio of gas mass to Lco is about a
factor of four lower than for Galactic molecular clouds, but that the gas mass
is a large fraction of the dynamical mass. Our analysis of CO emission reduces
the H2 mass from previous estimates of 2-5e10 Msun to 0.4-1.5e10 Msun, which is

due to the axisymmetric differential rotation and the density waves as well. We
present the theory of slender magnetic flux tube dynamics in the thin flux tube
approximation and the Lagrange description. This is the application of the
formalism obtained for solar magnetic flux tubes by Spruit (1981), to the
galactic conditions. We perform a linear stability analysis for the
Parker-shearing instability of magnetic flux tubes in galactic discs and then
calculate the dynamo coefficients. We present a number of new effects which are
very essential for cosmological and contemporary evolution of galactic magnetic
fields. First of all we demonstrate that a very strong dynamo $\alpha$-effect
is possible in the limit of weak magnetic fields in presence of cosmic rays.
Second, we show that the differential force resulting from axisymmetric
differential rotation and the linear density waves causes that the
$\alpha$-effect is essentially magnified in galactic arms and switched off in
the interarm regions. Moreover, we predict a non-uniform magnetic field in
spiral arms and well aligned one in interarm regions. These properties are well
confirmed by recent observational results by Beck & Hoernes (1996)

represent only 30% of all spirals. The true ELG fraction in clusters is 0.10;
this is consistent with that in the field (0.21) as a result of differences in
morphological mix. The average ELG fraction decreases with increasing velocity
dispersion of the cluster. Only 1/5 of the clusters shows a significant
difference in the average velocities of the ELG and the other (non-ELG)
galaxies; in a similar fraction of the clusters significant differences in
velocity dispersion are seen. Yet, the velocity dispersion of the ELG is, on
average, 20% larger than that of the non-ELG. This larger velocity dispersion
is largely intrinsic, i.e. it is not likely to be the result of velocity
offsets of the ELG. The surface density of the ELG is significantly less peaked
towards the centre than that of the non-ELG. The ELG are distributed fairly
smoothly within the cluster with at most 25% in compact substructures. The
distribution and kinematics of the ELG yield virial mass estimates that, on
average, are 50% higher than those based on the non-ELG. This probably means
that the ELG are on more radial orbits than the non-ELG. All observed
properties of the ELG are consistent with most of them being on their first
approach of the high-density cluster core.

cluster is notably changed from what was previously believed (a main region and
a south blob). The main emission comes from the central part of the main body
of the cluster on which is superimposed that of a foreground group of galaxies.
The foreground group and the main cluster are separated (if redshifts are
cosmological) by 46 1/h_50 Mpc. The southern blob is clearly not a group: it is
resolved into X-ray emitting galaxies (in particular the second more luminous
galaxy of the main cluster). Several X-ray features are identified with bright
galaxies. We performed a spectral analysis and derived the temperature (T),
metallicity (Z) and hydrogen column density NH. The global quantities are:
T=4keV (in agreement with the velocity dispersion of 760km/s) and
$Z=0.2Z_\odot$. We cannot derive accurate gradients for these quantities with
our data, but there is strong evidence that the temperature is lower ($\sim 2.8
keV$) and the metallicity much higher (Z $\sim 0.8 Z_\odot$) in the very centre
(within about 50 1/h_50 kpc). We present a pixel by pixel method to model the

Sasv\'ari, Schwabl, and Sz\'epfalusy is studied, where violation of detailed
balance is incorporated by allowing the order parameter and the dynamically
coupled conserved quantities to be governed by heat baths of different
temperatures $T_S$ and $T_M$, respectively. Dynamic perturbation theory and the
field-theoretic renormalization group are applied to one-loop order, and yield
two new fixed points in addition to the equilibrium ones. The first one
corresponds to $\Theta = T_S / T_M = \infty$ and leads to model A critical
behavior for the order parameter and to anomalous noise correlations for the
generalized angular momenta; the second one is at $\Theta = 0$ and is
characterized by mean-field behavior of the conserved quantities, by a dynamic
exponent $z = d / 2$ equal to that of the equilibrium SSS model, and by
modified static critical exponents. However, both these new fixed points are
unstable, and upon approaching the critical point detailed balance is restored,
and the equilibrium static and dynamic critical properties are recovered.

with arbitrary mass and spin in terms of scalar functions is reviewed and
applied to the stochastic phase space formulation of quantum mechanics.
Following Bacry and Kihlberg a four-dimensional internal spin space $\bar S$ is
chosen possessing an invariant measure and being able to represent integer as
well as half integer spins. $\bar S$ is a homogeneous space of the group $SL(2,
C)$ parametrized in terms of spinors $\a\in C_2$ and their complex conjugates
$\bar\a$. The generalized scalar quantum mechanical wave functions may be
reduced to yield irreducible components of definite physical mass and spin
$[m,s]$, with $m\ge 0$ and $s=0, 1/2, 1, 3/2 ...$, with spin described in terms
of the usual $(2s+1)$-component fields. Viewed from the internal space
description of spin this reduction amounts to a restriction of the variable
$\a$ to a compact subspace of $\bar S$, i.e. a ``spin shell'' $S^2_{r=2s}$ of
radius $r=2s$ in $ C_2$. This formulation of single particles or single
antiparticles of type $[m,s]$ is then used to study the geometro- stochastic
(i.e. quantum) propagation of amplitudes for arbitrary spin on a curved
background space-time possessing a metric and axial vector torsion treated as
external fields. A Poincar\'e gauge covariant path integral-like representation
for the probability amplitude (generalized wave function) of a particle with
arbitrary spin is derived satisfying a second order wave equation on the
Hilbert bundle constructed over curved space-time. The implications for the
stochastic nature of polarization effects in the presence of gravitation are
pointed out and the extension to Fock bundles of bosonic and fermionic type is
briefly mentioned.

suppress the baryon number violating operators. We present the simplest SU(6)

heterotic N=1 theories. Non-critical strings of various kinds, with low tension
for special values of the moduli, lead to interesting physical effects. We give
a complete classification of those divisors in toric manifolds that contribute
to the non-perturbative four-dimensional superpotential; the physical
singularities associated to it are related to the apppearance of tensionless
strings. In some cases non-perturbative effects generate an everywhere non-zero
quantum tension leading to a combination of a conventional field theory with
light strings hiding at a low energy scale related to supersymmetry breaking.

supergravity theory with gauge group SU[2]_{global}xU[1]_{local}. The model we
consider is known to admit string-like configurations, the so-called semi-local
cosmic strings. We show that the stability of these solutions is provided by
supersymmetry through the existence of a lower bound for the energy, even
though the manifold of the Higgs vacuum does not contain non-contractible
loops. Charged Killing spinors do exist over configurations that saturate the
Bogomolnyi bound, as a consequence of an Aharonov-Bohm-like effect.
Nevertheless, there are no physical fermionic zero modes on these backgrounds.
The exact vanishing of the cosmological constant does not imply, then,
Bose-Fermi degeneracy. This provides a non-trivial example of the recent claim
made by Witten on the vanishing of the cosmological constant in three
dimensions without unphysical degeneracies.

First, assuming conformal invariance, we explicitly calculate two-- and three--
point functions. This calculation is done for the general case of more than one
logarithmic field in a block, and more than one set of logarithmic fields. Then
we show that one can regard the logarithmic field as a formal derivative of the
ordinary field with respect to its conformal weight. This enables one to
calculate any $n$-- point function containing the logarithmic field in terms of
ordinary $n$--point functions. At last, we calculate the operator product
expansion (OPE) coefficients of a logarithmic conformal field theory, and show
that these can be obtained from the corresponding coefficients of ordinary
conformal theory by a simple derivation.

property of the diwhirls is that they are stationary, in contrast to the usual
localized wave structures in both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems which are
stabilized by wave dispersion. It is also a new object in fluid dynamics - a
couple of vortices that build a single entity somewhat similar to a magnetic
dipole. The diwhirls arise as a result of a purely elastic instability through
a hysteretic transition at negligible Reynolds numbers. It is suggested that
the vortex flow is driven by the same forces that cause the Weissenberg effect.
The diwhirls have a striking asymmetry between the inflow and outflow, which is
also an essential feature of the suggested elastic instability mechanism.
