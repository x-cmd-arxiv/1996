questioning the reliability of redshift-independent distances obtained using

photometry for 175 galaxies, new 21 cm observations of 11 galaxies, and new
velocity dispersion measurements for 62 galaxies are used together with

A2634 has a negligibly small peculiar velocity with respect to the Cosmic
Microwave Background reference frame. Because of the high accuracy with which
the two distance estimates have been obtained, their agreement strongly
supports the universality of the TF and FP relations, and therefore their
reliability for the estimate of redshift-independent distances.

the perhaps somewhat surprising result that for any finite choice of softening

of rotational support in the models. We comment on whether the hydrodynamical

effective action. As the Yukawa coupling is increased we find that the nonlocal
corrections play an increasingly important role. The corrections cause the
scalar field to increase in depth while maintaining its size. This increases
the energy of the bag configuration, but this is compensated for by more
tightly bound fermionic states with lower energy. In contrast to the
semi-classical picture without quantum corrections, the binding energy is
small, and the total energy scales directly with the Yukawa coupling. This
confirms the qualitative behavior found in earlier work using the second order
DE, although the quantitative solutions differ.

p+$^3$He $\rightarrow$ p+$^3$He and p+$^3$He $\rightarrow$ d+d are derived in
the Faddeev-Yakubovsky framework with special emphasis on leading order terms,
which are expected to be valid at intermediate energies. In addition, equations
for the fragmentations $^3$He(p,ppp)n and $^3$He(p,pp)d are derived within the
same framework. Again leading order terms for intermediate energies are
considered.

somewhat analogous to the Alexander module. We work with the (V_p,Z_p) theories
of Blanchet, Habegger, Masbaum and Vogel {BHMV} for p \ge 3, and consider the
associated modules. In {G}, we defined modules which also depend on the extra
data of a color c which is assigned to a meridian of the knot in the
construction of the module. These modules can be used to calculate the quantum
invariants of cyclic branched covers of knots and have other uses. Suppose now
that S is a satellite knot with companion C, and pattern P. We give formulas
for the Turaev-Viro modules for S in terms of the Turaev-Viro modules of C and
similar data coming from the pattern P. We compute these invariants explicitly
in several examples.

  Symposium on Fundamental Problems in Quantum Physics, Kluwer AP",,,,"quant-ph",,"  It is shown that correlations of dichotomic functions can not conform to
results from Quantum Mechanics. Also, it is seen that the assumptions attendant
to optical tests of Bell's Inequalities actually are consistent with classical
physics so that in conclusion, Bell's Theorems do not preclude hidden variable
interpretations of Quantum Mechanics.
