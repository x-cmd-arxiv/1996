width, and their mean blueshift and width are comparable to the broad Lyman
line and continuum absorption seen in far-UV spectra from the Hopkins

the broadest absorption trough, and narrow absorption at the systemic velocity
of NGC 4151, presumably in its own ISM, absorbs the core of the narrow emission

the effects of a single (or perhaps several) spatially localized impurities.
Even with these restrictions, the predicted behavior is very rich, and
strikingly different than for a 1d non-interacting electron gas. The method of
bosonization is reviewed, with an emphasis on physical motivation, rather than
mathematical rigor. Transport through a single impurity is reviewed from
several different perspectives, as a pinned strongly interacting ``Wigner""
crystal and in the limit of weak interactions. The existence of fractionally
charged quasiparticles is also revealed. Inter-edge tunnelling in the quantum
Hall effect, and charge fluctuations in a quantum dot under the conditions of

variation in the concentration between the two fluids acts as an active scalar
leading to a redefined conservation law for the energy, which is incorporated
into the model together with a conservation law for the scalar. The model is
studied numerically at very high values of the Prandtl and Reynolds numbers and
we investigate the properties close to the critical point of the miscibility
gap where the diffusivity vanishes. A peak develops in the spectrum of the
scalar, showing that a strongly turbulent flow leads to an increase in the
mixing time. The peak is, however, not very pronounced. The mixing time
diverges with the Prandtl number as a power law with an exponent of
approximately 0.9. The continuum limit of the shell equations leads to a set of
equations which can be solved by a scaling ansatz, consistent with an exact
scaling of the Navier-Stokes equations in the inertial range. In this case a
weak peak also persists for a certain time in the spectrum of the scalar. Exact
analytic solutions of the continuous shell equations are derived in the
inertial range. Starting with fluids at rest, from an initial variation of the
concentration difference, one can provoke a ``spontaneous'' generation of a
velocity field, analogous to MHD in the early universe.

profile of the laser beam, and show how this leads to a steady-state flow of
lipid along the surface and gradients in the local lipid concentration and
surface tension (or chemical potential). This leads to a natural explanation
for front propagation and makes several predictions based on the tubule length.
While most of the qualitative conclusions of previous studies remain the same,
the `ramped' control parameter (surface tension) implies several new
qualitative results. We also explore some of the consequences of front
propagation into a noisy (due to pre-existing thermal fluctuations) unstable

effective action is proposed. Two-dimensional supergravity and $W_3$-gravity
are used as examples to demonstrate its potential. An operator is introduced
that associates each physical quantity with a Ward identity, i.e., a quantity
that is transformed without anomalous terms and can be nullified in a
consistent manner. A covariant form of the action for matter field interacting
with a gravitational and $W_3$-gravitational background is proposed.

group, taking into account touching (or branching) interactions. The c<1
modified matrix model with string exponent gamma>0 is naturally associated with
an unstable fixed point, separating the Liouville phase (gamma<0) from the
branched polymer phase (gamma=1/2). It is argued that at c=1 this multicritical
fixed point and the Liouville fixed point coalesce, and that both fixed points
disappear for c>1. In this picture, the critical behavior of c>1 matrix models
is generically that of branched polymers, but only within a scaling region
which is exponentially small when c -> 1. It also explains the behavior of
multiple Ising spins coupled to gravity. Large crossover effects occur for c-1
small enough, with a c ~ 1 pseudo-scaling which explains numerical results.

Polish space X, then for any invariant Borel set B we can change the topology
on X so that B becomes open, the Borel structure is preserved, and the action

  In this brief paper a short proof is presented for their theorem. The method
also gives optimal bounds in terms of minimizing the change to the original
topology.
