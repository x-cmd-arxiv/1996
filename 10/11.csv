if the expansion rate is not too large (i.e. $h \equiv H_0/(100 \kmsMpc) \lsim
0.6$). I discuss CHDM together with its chief competitor among CDM variants,
low-$\Omega_0$ CDM with a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM). $\Lambda$CDM
with $\Omega_0 \sim 0.3$ has the possible virtue of allowing a higher expansion
rate H_0 for a given cosmic age t_0, but the defect of predicting too much
fluctuation power on small scales. Also, except for the $H_0-t_0$ problem,
there is not a shred of evidence in favor of a nonzero cosmological constant,
only increasingly stringent observational upper bounds on it. CHDM has less
power on small scales, in good agreement with data, although it remains to be
seen whether it predicts early enough galaxy formation to be compatible with
the latest high-redshift data. I also briefly compare CHDM to other CDM
variants such as Warm Dark Matter (WDM) and tilted CDM. CHDM has the advantage
among $\Omega=1$ CDM-type models of requiring little or no tilt, which appears
to be an advantage in fitting recent small-angle CMB anisotropy data. The
presence of a hot component that clusters less than cold dark matter lowers the
effective $\Omega_0$ that would be measured on small scales, which appears to
be in accord with observations, and it may also avoid the discrepancy between
the high central density of dark matter halos from CDM simulations compared to
evidence from rotation curves of dwarf spiral galaxies.

Mott-insulating regions induces a spin gap or pseudogap in the environment of
the stripes. We present a theory of underdoped high temperature superconductors
and show that there is a {\it local} separation of spin and charge, and that
the mobile holes on an individual stripe acquire a spin gap via pair hopping
between the stripe and its environment; i.e. via a magnetic analog of the usual
superconducting proximity effect. In this way a high pairing scale without a
large mass renormalization is established despite the strong Coulomb repulsion
between the holes. Thus the {\it mechanism} of pairing is the generation of a
spin gap in spatially-confined {\it Mott-insulating} regions of the material in
the proximity of the metallic stripes. At non-vanishing stripe densities,
Josephson coupling between stripes produces a dimensional crossover to a state
with long-range superconducting phase coherence. This picture is established by
obtaining exact and well-controlled approximate solutions of a model of a
one-dimensional electron gas in an active environment. An extended discussion

formation {\it if} the cosmological matter density is near critical (i.e.,
$\Omega_0 \approx 1$) and {\it if} the expansion rate is not too large (i.e. $h
\equiv H_0/(100 \kmsMpc) \lsim 0.6$). I discuss CHDM together with its chief
competitor among CDM variants, low-$\Omega_0$ CDM with a cosmological constant
(\lcdm). \lcdm\ with $\Omega_0 \sim 0.3$ has the possible virtue of allowing a
higher expansion rate $H_0$ for a given cosmic age $t_0$, but the defect of
predicting too much fluctuation power on small scales. Also, except for the
$H_0-t_0$ problem, there is not a shred of evidence in favor of a nonzero
cosmological constant, only increasingly stringent observational upper bounds
on it. CHDM has less power on small scales, in good agreement with data,
although it remains to be seen whether it predicts early enough galaxy
formation to be compatible with the latest high-redshift data. CHDM has the
advantage among $\Omega=1$ CDM-type models of requiring little or no tilt,
which appears to be an advantage in fitting recent small-angle cosmic microwave
background anisotropy data. The presence of a hot component that clusters less
than cold dark matter lowers the effective $\Omega_0$ that would be measured on
small scales, which appears to be in accord with observations, and it may also
avoid the discrepancy between the high central density of dark matter halos
from CDM simulations compared to evidence from rotation curves of dwarf spiral
galaxies.

u^c d^c d^c direction in R-parity symmetric extensions of the minimal
supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) which contain a gauge singlet superfield
phi. Such gauge singlets commonly occur in extensions of the MSSM, for example
in models which seek to account for neutrino masses. We consider a two scalar
Affleck-Dine mechanism, with the flat direction stabilized by a
non-renormalizible superpotential term of the form (lambda/M) phi udd ~
(lambda/M) phi psi^3, where psi corresponds to the gauge non-singlet flat
direction. We give approximate solutions of the scalar field equations of
motion which describe the evolution of the condensates and show that the final
baryon asymmetry in this case is suppressed relative to that expected from the
conventional single scalar Affleck-Dine mechanism, based on a superpotential
term of the form (lambda/(4M)) psi^4, by a factor
(m_{s}/(m_{phi}+m_{s}))^(1/2), where m_{s} is the soft supersymmetry breaking
scalar mass and m_{phi} is the supersymmetric phi mass. It is possible for the
model to generate a baryon asymmetry even in the limit of unbroken B-L, so long
as the gauge singlet condensate doesn't decay until after anomalous electroweak
B+L violation is out of equilibrium following the electroweak phase transition.
This condition is generally satisfied if all Dirac neutrino masses are less
than around 10keV. This class of Affleck-Dine models can, in principle,be
experimentally ruled out, for example by the observation of a Dirac mass for
the mu or tau neutrino significantly larger than around 10keV together with a
mostly Higgsino LSP.

applying a new method, the interfering amplitude method, which treats the
T-matrix directly and describes multi-resonances in conformity with the
unitarity. As a result, the existence of \sigma has been strongly suggested

the KK- thresholds, with mass = 553.3 +- 0.5_{st} MeV and width= 242.6 +-

compactification as extremal black holes with zero entropy and infinite
temperature. We show how the p-branes avoid this apparent, catastrophic
instability by developing an infinite mass gap. Equivalently, these black holes
behave like elementary particles: they are dressed by effective potentials that
prevent absorption of impinging particles. In contrast, configurations with 2,
3, and 4 intersecting branes and their nonextremal extensions, behave
increasingly like conventional black holes. These results extend and clarify
earlier work by Holzhey and Wilczek in the context of four dimensional dilaton
gravity.

the charge operator are presented. Corrections arising from the quark-gluon

protein folding is probed. The model has only two types of residues,
hydrophobic and hydrophilic. In absence of local interactions, native structure
formation does not occur for the temperatures considered. By including sequence
independent local interactions, which qualitatively reproduce local properties
of functional proteins, the dominance of a native state for many sequences is
observed. As in lattice model approaches, folding takes place by gradual
compactification, followed by a sequence dependent folding transition. Our
results differ from lattice approaches in that bimodal energy distributions are
not observed and that high folding temperatures are accompanied by relatively
low temperatures for the peak of the specific heat. Also, in contrast to
earlier studies using lattice models, our results convincingly demonstrate that
one does not need more than two types of residues to generate sequences with
good thermodynamic folding properties in three dimensions.
