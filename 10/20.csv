observed temperature function of X-ray cluster of galaxies. The cluster mass
function has been thoroughly studied in simulations and analytically, but a
direct simulation of the temperature function is presented here for the first
time. Adaptive hydrodynamic simulations using the cosmological Moving Mesh
Hydro code of Pen (1997a) are used to calibrate the temperature function for
different popular cosmologies. Applying the new normalizations to the
present-day cluster abundances, we find $\sigma_8=0.53\pm 0.05
\Omega_0^{-0.45}$ for a hyperbolic universe, and $\sigma_8=0.53\pm 0.05
\Omega_0^{-0.53}$ for a spatially flat universe with a cosmological constant.
The simulations followed the gravitational shock heating of the gas and dark
matter, and used a crude model for potential energy injection by supernova
heating. The error bars are dominated by uncertainties in the heating/cooling
models. We present fitting formulae for the mass-temperature conversions and
cluster abundances based on these simulations.

low-energy electrons by turbulent plasma waves. We consider the resonant
interaction of the charged particles with all branches of the transverse plasma
waves propagating parallel to a uniform magnetic field. Numerical results and
asymptotic analytic solutions valid at non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic
energies are obtained for the acceleration and scattering times of electrons.
These times have a strong dependence on plasma parameter alpha = Omega_pe /
Omega_e (the ratio of electron plasma frequency to electron gyrofrequency) and
on the spectral index of plasma turbulence. It is shown that particles with
energies above certain critical value may interact with higher frequency
electromagnetic plasma waves and this interaction is allowed only in plasmas
with alpha < 1. We show that for non-relativistic and semi-relativistic
electrons in low-alpha plasmas the ratio of the acceleration time to the
scattering time can be less than unity for a wide range of energies. From this
we conclude that the transport equation derived for cosmic rays which requires
this ratio to be much larger than one is not applicable at these energies. An
approximate ""critical"" value of particle energy above which the dynamics of
charged particles may be described by this transport equation is determined as
a function of plasma parameters. We propose new transport equation for the
opposite limit (energies less than this critical value) when the acceleration
rate is much faster than the pitch angle scattering rate. This equation is
needed to describe the electron dynamics in plasmas with alpha <= 0.1.

that the fractal behavior which characterizes the small scale galaxy

defined cutoff with an outer length scale of order 30h$^{-1}$ Mpc. For example,
plots of the IRAS 1.2 Jy survey exhibit a very clear approach to homogeneity on
large scale, in complete contradiction to the endless fractal model.

an observing program was conducted at the Mount Palomar 5-m telescope from
1994-1996. The observations consisted of follow-up observations of known
objects (in order to improve their very indeterminate orbits), and deep
exposures on a single field to search for small objects below the limiting
magnitudes of other surveys. Eighteen object recoveries were successfully
obtained over the course of the follow-up program. Data reduction of the deep
fields consisted of a software recombination of many fields shifted at
different angular rates in order to detect objects at differing heliocentric
distances. We set an upper limit of <1 object per 0.05 square degrees in the
ecliptic brighter than magnitude R ~ 25. The lack of detected objects in this
work serves to help constrain the number density of Kuiper Belt comets.

of the $\Upsilon$ family. We demonstrate that $p_T$-dependence of the
$\Upsilon'/\Upsilon$ ratio is only expected if a quark-gluon plasma with
significant energy density is present, and that the precise dependence of this
ratio will strongly constrain the QGP models. We also propose that the $p_T$
spectra of the $\Upsilon$ resonances themselves will provide valuable
information by comparing these spectra to that of the $Z$ boson, which should
not be influenced by plasma production.

observables is presented. This approach is based on an analogous classical
control technique reported previously[J. Botina, H. Rabitz and N. Rahman, J.
chem. Phys. Vol. 102, pag. 226 (1995)]. Quantum Lagrange multiplier functions
are used to preserve a chosen subset of the observable dynamics of interest. As
a result, a corresponding small set of Lagrange multipliers needs to be
calculated and they are only a function of time. This is a considerable
simplification over traditional quantum optimal control theory[S. shi and H.
Rabitz, comp. Phys. Comm. Vol. 63, pag. 71 (1991)]. The success of the new
approach is based on taking advantage of the multiplicity of solutions to
virtually any problem of quantum control to meet a physical objective. A family
of such simplified formulations is introduced and numerically tested. Results
are presented for these algorithms and compared with previous reported work on
a model problem for selective unimolecular reaction induced by an external
optical electric field.
