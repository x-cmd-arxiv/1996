is a hard power-law with a photon spectral index between 1.8 and 2.6 (90%
confidence limits). We present a model of V404 Cyg in which the accretion flow
has two components: (1) an outer thin disk with a small annular extent, and (2)
a large interior region where the flow is advection-dominated. Nearly all the
radiation in the infrared, optical, UV and X-ray bands is from the
advection-dominated zone; the thin disk radiates primarily in the infrared
where it contributes about ten percent of the observed flux. The spectrum we
calculate with this model is in excellent agreement with the ASCA X-ray data
presented here, as well as with previous optical data. Moreover, the fit is
very insensitive to the choice of parameters such as black hole mass, orbital
inclination, viscosity coefficient $\alpha$, and magnetic field strength. We
consider the success of the model to be strong support for the
advection-dominated accretion paradigm, and further evidence of the black hole
nature of V404 Cyg. We discuss strategies whereby systems with
advection-dominated accretion could be used to prove the reality of event
horizons in black holes.

model testing to the realm of oblique interplanetary shocks: here observations
of proton and alpha particle distributions made by the SWICS ion mass
spectrometer on Ulysses at nearby interplanetary shocks are compared with test
particle Monte Carlo simulation predictions of accelerated populations. The
plasma parameters used in the simulation are obtained from measurements of
solar wind particles and the magnetic field upstream of individual shocks. Good
agreement between downstream spectral measurements and the simulation
predictions are obtained for two shocks by allowing the the ratio of the
mean-free scattering length to the ionic gyroradius, to vary in an optimization
of the fit to the data. Generally small values of this ratio are obtained,
corresponding to the case of strong scattering. The acceleration process
appears to be roughly independent of the mass or charge of the species.

has two main features: the main signal for theta<4', and an almost flat plateau

perhaps, to probe otherwise undetectable faint diffuse X-ray emission.

cloud emission anisotropy, cloud obscuration, a CLOUDY-generated emissivity
function and a narrow-line component used to generate the line profiles, and is
driven with continuum input based on the monitoring campaigns of NGC 5548. The
line strengths, profiles and lags are compared with the observations. It
reproduces the basic features of CIV line variability in this AGN without
varying the model parameters. The best fit model provides the effective size,
the dominant geometry, the emissivity distribution and the 3D velocity field of
the CIV BLR and constrains the mass of the central BH. The inner part of the
wind appears to be responsible for the anisotropically emitted CIV line, while
its outer part remains dusty and molecular, thus having similar spectral
characteristics to a molecular torus, although its dynamics is fundamentally
different. In addition, our model predicts a differential response across the
CIV line profile, producing a red-side-first response in the mid-wings followed
by the blue mid-wing and by the line core. Based on the comparison of data and
model cross-correlation functions and 1D and 2D transfer functions, we find
that the rotating outflow model is compatible with observations of the BLR in

$SU(2)$ link variables onto $Z_2$ center elements, and ``center dominance'' is
the fact that the center-projected link elements carry most of the information
about the string tension of the full theory. We present numerical evidence that
the thin $Z_2$ vortices of the projected configurations are associated with
``thick'' $Z_2$ vortices in the unprojected configurations. The evidence also
suggests that the thick $Z_2$ vortices may play a significant role in the
confinement process.

identification of the bound states with the cycles also provides their
topological stability and suggests that the bound states of five-branes have
internal structures. The partition function of the second-quantized five-branes
is also discussed.

rescalings of the metric, and first proposed by Eastwood and Singer. This paper
studies the corresponding quantization in flat Euclidean 4-space. The resulting
ghost operator is a fourth-order elliptic operator, while the operator P on
perturbations of the potential is a sixth-order elliptic operator. The operator
P may be reduced to a second-order non-minimal operator if a dimensionless
gauge parameter tends to infinity. Gauge-invariant boundary conditions are
obtained by setting to zero at the boundary the whole set of perturbations of
the potential, jointly with ghost perturbations and their normal derivative.
This is made possible by the fourth-order nature of the ghost operator. An
analytic representation of the ghost basis functions is also obtained.

wrap once around the compact dimension. The Hamiltonian can be organized as
describing $N_s$ interacting strings, the exact supermembrane corresponding to
$N_s\to \infty$. The zero-mode part of $N_s-1$ strings turn out to be precisely
the modes which are responsible of instabilities. For sufficiently large
compactification radius $R_0$, interactions are negligible and the
lowest-energy excitations are described by a set of harmonic oscillators. We
compute the physical spectrum to leading order, which becomes exact in the
limit $ g^2 \to \infty $, where $g^2\equiv 4\pi^2 T_3 R_0^3$ and $T_3$ is the
membrane tension. As the radius is decreased, more strings become strongly
interacting and their oscillation modes get frozen. In the zero-radius limit,
the spectrum is constituted of the type IIA superstring spectrum, plus an
infinite number of extra states associated with flat directions of the quartic
potential.

been proposed for describing the most stable Hall plateaus (the Jain series):
the multi-component Abelian theories and the minimal W-infinity models. They
both lead to a-priori classifications of quantum Hall universality classes.
Some experiments already confirmed the basic predictions common to both
effective theories, while other experiments will soon pin down their detailed
properties and differences. Based on the study of partition functions, we show
that the Abelian theories are rational conformal field theories while the
minimal W-infinity models are not.

measurements in heavy-ion collisions, utilizing an improved experimental set-up
at the double-Orange beta-spectrometer of GSI. The collision system U+Ta was
reinvestigated in three independent runs at beam energies in the range
(6.0-6.4)xA MeV and different target thicknesses, with the objective to
reproduce a narrow sum-energy e+e- line at ~635 keV observed previously in this
collision system. At improved statistical accuracy, the line could not be found
in these new data. For the ''fission'' scenario, an upper limit (1 sigma) on
its production probability per collision of 1.3x10^{-8} can be set which has to
be compared to the previously reported value of [4.9 +- 0.8 (stat.) +- 1.0
(syst)]x10^{-7}. In the light of the new results, a reanalysis of the old data
shows that the continuous part of the spectrum at the line position is
significantly higher than previously assumed, thus reducing the production
probability of the line by a factor of two and its statistical significance to
< 3.4sigma.

role, in the ground states of odd-odd $N=Z$ nuclei, in agreement with
experiment. By studying pairing in the ground states of $^{52-58}$Fe, we
observe that the isovector proton-neutron correlations decrease rapidly with
increasing neutron excess. In contrast, both the proton, and trivially the
neutron correlations increase as neutrons are added.
  We also study the thermal properties and the temperature dependence of pair
correlations for $^{50}$Mn and $^{52}$Fe as exemplars of odd-odd and even-even
$N=Z$ nuclei. While for $^{52}$Fe results are similar to those obtained for
other even-even nuclei in this mass range, the properties of $^{50}$Mn at low
temperatures are strongly influenced by isovector neutron-proton pairing. In
coexistence with these isovector pair correlations, our calculations also
indicate an excess of isoscalar proton-neutron pairing over the mean-field
values. The isovector neutron-proton correlations rapidly decrease with
temperatures and vanish for temperatures above $T=700$ keV, while the isovector
correlations among like nucleons persist to higher temperatures. Related to the
quenching of the isovector proton-neutron correlations, the average isospin
decreases from 1, appropriate for the ground state, to 0 as the temperature
increases.
