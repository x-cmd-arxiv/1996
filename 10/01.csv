assumes two main infall episodes for the formation of halo-thick disk and thin
disk, respectively. We do not try to take into account explicitly the evolution
of the halo but we implicitly assume that the timescale for the formation of
the halo was of the same order as the timescale for the formation of the thick
disk. The formation of the thin-disk is much longer than that of the thick
disk, implying that the infalling gas forming the thin-disk comes not only from
the thick disk but mainly from the intergalactic medium. The timescale for the
formation of the thin-disk is assumed to be a function of the galactocentric
distance, leading to an inside-out picture for the Galaxy building. The model
takes into account the most up to date nucleosynthesis prescriptions and adopts
a threshold in the star formation process which naturally produces a hiatus in
the star formation rate at the end of the thick disk phase, as suggested by
recent observations. The model results are compared with an extended set of
observational constraints. Among these constraints, the tightest one is the
metallicity distribution of the G-dwarf stars for which new data are now
available. Our model fits very well these new data. We show that in order to
reproduce most of these constraints a timescale $\le 1$ Gyr for the
(halo)-thick-disk and of 8 Gyr for the thin-disk formation in the solar
vicinity are required. We predict that the radial abundance gradients in the
inner regions of the disk ($R< R_{\odot}$) are steeper than in the outer
regions, a result confirmed by recent abundance determinations, and that the
inner ones steepen in time during the Galactic lifetime.

consistently model the spectral and imaging X-ray data, and discuss the

We also present results from an extensive optical study of the clusters and
report the discovery of a gravitational arc in Abell 1835. The lensing data
provide an indepenent constraint on the distribution of mass in the cluster, in
good agreement with the results from the mutliphase (although not single-phase)

intrinsic column densities associated with their cooling flows. These clusters
also exhibit significant amounts of reddening in the optical spectra of their

``standard'' gravitational lensing statistics model in an arbitrary, flat
Robertson-Walker universe, where lensing galaxies are singular isothermal
spheres that follow the Schechter luminosity function. In a flat universe, the
probability distribution is independent of the source distribution in space and
in brightness. The distribution is compared with observed multiple-image lens
cases through Monte-Carlo simulations and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The
predicted distribution depends on the shape of the angular selection bias used,
which varies for different observations. The test result also depends on which
lens systems are included in the samples. We mainly include the lens systems
where a single galaxy is responsible for lensing. We find that the ``standard''
model predicts a distribution which is different from the observed one.
However, the statistical significance of the discrepancy is not large enough to
invalidate the ``standard'' model with high confidence. Only the radio data
reject the model at the 95% confidence level, which is based on four/three lens
cases. Therefore, we cannot say that the observational data reject the
``standard'' model with enough statistical confidence. However, if we take the
velocity dispersion of dark matter without the conversion factor (3/2)^(1/2)
from that of luminous matter, the discrepancy is quite severe, and even the
ground-based optical survey data reject the ``standard'' model with > ~90%

interstellar magnetized cloud experiences a ``runaway collapse'' phase, in

Finally, it enters an accretion phase, in which inflowing matter accretes onto
a central high-density disk or a new-born star. We found that the accretion
rate reaches (4 -- 40) $\times c_s^3/G$, where $c_s$ and $G$ represent the
isothermal sound speed and the gravitational constant, respectively. This is
much larger than the standard accretion rate of $0.975c_s^3/G$ for a
hydrostatic isothermal spherical cloud (Shu 1977, AAA19.065.044). Due to the
effect of an extra infall velocity achieved in the runaway phase ($\sim 2
c_s$), the accretion rate is boosted. This rate declines with time in contrast
to Shu's solution, but keeps $\gtsim 2.5 c_s^3/G$. The observed gas infall rate

dynamics and the diffusion-annihilation problem in the free fermion case. We
show that the well-known duality transformation between the two problems can be
formulated as a similarity transformation if one uses appropriate (toroidal)
boundary conditions. This allow us to establish and clarify the precise nature
of the relationship between the two models. In this way we obtain a one-to-one
correspondence between observables and initial states in the two problems. A
random initial state in Glauber dynamics is related to a short range correlated
state in the annihilation problem. In particular the long-time behaviour of the
density in this state is seen to depend on the initial conditions. Hence, we
show that the presence of correlations in the initial state determine the
dependence of the long time behaviour of the density on the initial conditions,
even if such correlations are short-ranged. We also apply a field-theoretical
method to the calculation of multi-time correlation functions in this initial
state.

transition to a spatial Bose-Einstein condensed state for dimension D greater
than or equal to 2. The thermodynamic limit requires maintaining constant
average density by weakening the potential while increasing the particle number
N to infinity, while of course in real experiments the potential is fixed and N
stays finite. For such finite ideal harmonic systems we show that a BEC still
occurs, although without a true phase transition, below a certain
``pseudo-critical'' temperature, even for D=1. We study the momentum-space
condensate fraction and find that it vanishes as 1/N^(1/2) in any number of
dimensions in the thermodynamic limit. In D less than or equal to 2 the lack of
a momentum condensation is in accord with the Hohenberg theorem, but must be
reconciled with the existence of a spatial BEC in D=2. For finite systems we
derive the N-dependence of the spatial and momentum condensate fractions and
the transition temperatures, features that may be experimentally testable. We
show that the N-dependence of the 2D ideal-gas transition temperature for a
finite system cannot persist in the interacting case because it violates a

that is, a way of classifying interactions so that it is clear, given a domain,
which negotiation mechanisms and strategies are appropriate. We define State
Oriented Domains, a general category of interaction. Necessary and sufficient
conditions for cooperation are outlined. We use the notion of worth in an
altered definition of utility, thus enabling agreements in a wider class of
joint-goal reachable situations. An approach is offered for conflict
resolution, and it is shown that even in a conflict situation, partial
cooperative steps can be taken by interacting agents (that is, agents in
fundamental conflict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain point). A
Unified Negotiation Protocol (UNP) is developed that can be used in all types
of encounters. It is shown that in certain borderline cooperative situations, a
partial cooperative agreement (i.e., one that does not achieve all agents'
goals) might be preferred by all agents, even though there exists a rational
agreement that would achieve all their goals. Finally, we analyze cases where
agents have incomplete information on the goals and worth of other agents.
First we consider the case where agents' goals are private information, and we
analyze what goal declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase
their utility. Then, we consider the situation where the agents' goals (and
therefore stand-alone costs) are common knowledge, but the worth they attach to
their goals is private information. We introduce two mechanisms, one 'strict',
the other 'tolerant', and analyze their affects on the stability and efficiency
of negotiation outcomes.

inducing the classical energy norm, and an application of the above result
yields that its ``purification'' induces on the one-particle space of the

the combined description of small, intermediate, and large longitudinal

two-body reactions $\pi\pi\to \rho \gamma^*$, $\pi\rho\to \pi \gamma^*$, and
the decay process $\rho \to \pi \pi \gamma^*$ give significant contributions.
Non-equilibrium contributions to the thermal rate are estimated, including the
modification of the particle distribution function with non-zero pion chemical
potential. The comparison of the dilepton rate with the recent data measured in

corresponding correction is shown to have only a small effect on the predicted
ratio. However, it is found that the experimental result for the ratio
crucially depends on an accurate measurement of the energy of the knocked out
nucleon.

when $q$ is a root of unity. And the $gl_q(n)$-covariant q-Virasoro algebra is
presented by using the $gl_q(n)$-covariant oscillators.
