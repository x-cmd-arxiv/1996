We consider two possible explanations for the production of the filamentary

The feature could arise from either ram pressure stripped gas or a dark matter

background (CMB) photons propagating through space, the effect of `mixing
geodesics' appears with a distinct signature that depends on the geometry of
space. In a Universe with negative curvature this effect is expected to produce
elongated anisotropy spots on CMB maps. We used COBE-DMR data to look for such
effect. Based on the analysis of a measure of eccentricity of hot spots it
appears that there is a clear indication of an excess eccentricity of hot spots
with respect to that expected from noise alone. This result must be interpreted
with caution as this effect can be due in part to galactic emission. If the
detected eccentricity of anisotropy spots can be attributed to the effect of
mixing it implies the negative curvature of the Universe and a value of $\Omega
< 1$.

in a bulge, following the r^{1/4} law, and a disc with an exponential projected
density profile; and that the isodensity surfaces of each component can be
represented by similar concentric spheroids. Under these conditions we produce
the rotational velocity and velocity dispersion profiles, after taking into
account both the asymmetric drift effects and the integration along the line of
sight. The model is successfully applied to reproduce the stellar kinematic and
photometry of the bulge of the 4 lenticular and early-type spiral galaxies NGC
4565, NGC 7814, NGC 5866 and NGC 4594. For these galaxies detailed stellar
kinematical data are available at different positions across the galaxy. The
application of our models shows that: 1) For all the galaxies considered in
this work, an isotropic model is able to reproduce the whole dynamical data.
This is surprising in the special case of NGC 4565, for which previous models
were unable to reproduce the velocity distribution without introducing strong
anisotropies. 2) We do not need a dark mass halo to reproduce these data. This
do not mean that a dark halo is not present, but just that its dynamical
effects in these inner regions of the galaxies are negligible.

Ginga spectra are well represented by power laws with an energy spectral index
of alpha~0.6 and a Compton reflection component including a fluorescent Fe
K-alpha corresponding to the solid angle of the reflector of ~0.3 times 2 Pi.
The overall Ginga/OSSE spectra can be modelled by repeated Compton scattering
in a mildly-relativistic, tau ~1, plasma. However, the high-energy cutoff is
steeper than that due to single-temperature thermal Comptonisation. It can be
described by a superposition of dominant optically-thin, thermal emission at
kT~140 keV and a Wien-like component from an optically-thick plasma at kT~50
keV. The X-ray spectra do not show the presence of an anisotropy break required
if thermal Compton scattering takes place in a corona above a cold disc. Also,
the flat spectral index shows that the plasma is soft-photon starved, i.e., the
luminosity in incident soft X-ray seed photons is very much less than that in
the hard X-rays. Furthermore, the observed solid angle of the reflector is
significantly less than 2 pi. These facts taken together strongly rule out a
disc-corona geometry. Rather, the observed spectra are consistent with a
geometry in which the cold accretion disc (which both supplies the seed soft
X-rays and reflects hard X-rays) only exists at large radii, while the
Comptonising hot plasma is located in an inner region with no cold disc. This
hot plasma consists of either pure electron-positron pairs if the source size

are ejected from small stellar clusters within molecular clouds. In particular,
we study how the interaction that leads to ejection may hasten the transition
between Classical and Weak-lined T Tauri status. In our models, ejections of T
Tauri stars at velocities of 3-10 km/s truncate the accretion disc at radii
between 1 and 10 a.u., reducing the viscous evolution time of the disc so that
accretion rapidly ceases. The observational appearance of the resulting systems
is then dependent on the presence or absence of a stellar magnetic field. For
non-magnetic stars we find that a near-infra red excess should persist due to
reprocessing of stellar radiation, but that this is greatly diminished for
magnetic T Tauri stars by the presence of a magnetosphere extending to
corotation. In either case, there is a period when ejected stars should appear
as non-accreting systems with detectable circumstellar material at wavelengths
of 5 microns and beyond. We discuss the implications of these results for
models in which ejected stars contribute to the halo of pre-main-sequence
objects discovered from ROSAT observations of star forming regions and the

large-scale CMB structure, our analysis was performed in most detail in a ROSAT
selected region of the sky (40 deg < b, 70 < l < 250 deg) in an X-ray energy
range with minimal Galactic structure and residual X-ray contamination.
Comparing to other regions of the sky and neighbouring energies and
frequencies, we find indication for a positive Galactic correlation on large
scales. Removing a quadrupole term on a sky map with a Galactic cutout or
related gradients in the selected regions leaves no correlations above a
1-sigma level on smaller angular scales. We conclude that there is no
significant extragalactic correlation on scales for which the combined data are
sensitive (7 deg - 40 deg) and that Galactic correlation is significant only on
angular scales of the order of the quadrupole. In the context of removing large
angular scale gradients we give results on best fit X-ray dipoles from various
ROSAT data and discuss these with respect to the difficulty of finding a
cosmological dipole. The lowest correlation upper limits we can place are about
15 % of COBE CMB fluctuations and about 10 % of the ROSAT extragalactic XRB

mechanisms.

configuration for a system with unit baryon number is found. We then solve the
tensor-RPA equation employing simple models of the nucleon ground state. In
general the ph interaction effects a decrease of the excited states to lower
energies. Due to an enhanced level density at low energies the obtained spectra
cannot be matched with the experimental data when a standard MIT-bag
configuration is used. However, when the size of the nucleon quark core is
reduced to approximately 0.3 fm a fair description of the baryon spectrum in
the positive-parity channel is achieved. For this purpose the residual
interaction turns out to be crucial and leads to a significant improvement
compared with the mean-field spectra.

extending from the proton drip line to the neutron drip line have been
calculated by use of the 1992 version of the finite-range droplet model. The
calculated quantities include the ground-state mass, deformation, microscopic
correction, odd-proton and odd-neutron spins and parities, proton and neutron
pairing gaps, binding energy, one- and two-neutron separation energies,
quantities related to beta-delayed one- and two-neutron emission probabilities,
beta-decay energy release and half-life with respect to Gamow-Teller decay,
one- and two-proton separation energies, and alpha-decay energy release and
half-life. For 1,654 nuclei heavier than oxygen-16 whose masses were known
experimentally in 1989 and which were included in the adjustment of model
constants, the theoretical error is 0.669 MeV. For 371 additional nuclei
heavier than oxygen-16 whose masses have been measured between 1989 and 1996
and which were not used in the adjustment of the model constants, the
theoretical error is 0.570 MeV. We also discuss the extrapolateability of two
other recent global models of the macroscopic-microscopic type, and conclude
with a brief discussion of the recently discovered rock of metastable
superheavy nuclei near Z = 110, A = 272 that had been correctly predicted by
macroscopic-microscopic models.

is shown that in the framework of CP(N-1) model supplementary elements which
are non-local in spacetime but local in the projective Hilbert space permit us
to avoid at least one of the main difficulties of quantum theory-the necessity
to relate the ``reality'' of a quantum state with a measuring process. In the

Continuous monitoring of the ion fluorescence is used in conjunction with
selective coherent feedback to eliminate these errors immediately following
spontaneous emission events, and the conditional time evolution between quantum
jumps is removed by symmetrizing the quantum codewords.
