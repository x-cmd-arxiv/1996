To appear in ApJ",,"10.1086/303814",,"astro-ph",,"  We explore possible depletion factors for Li6 in the three stars where it has
been detected. To this end, we assume that 6Li/H scales as 16O/H throughout the
galactic evolution, an assumption motivated by the observations of a similar
scaling for 9Be. We examine the uncertainties attached to this modeling of 6Li
galactic evolution; we also incorporate a recent evaluation of the primordial
production of 6Li. The depletion factor D6, for 6Li, in HD84937, is constrained
to be less than 4 at 95% c.l.. This depletion factor is an extreme upper limit
on the depletion factor for 7Li. We conclude that the primordial abundance of
7Li cannot be higher that twice the observed value, since no current stellar
model is able to reproduce the observed trends of 7Li with temperature and
metallicity, and yet deplete 7Li by more than a factor 2, while satisfying
D6<4. All three 6Li observations are in excellent agreement with all standard
expectations: Big-Bang nucleosynthesis with 2<$\eta_{10}$<6.5, and standard
isochrones of 6Li survival. We discuss possible deviations from our assumption
of 6Li/H scaling with 16O/H, due to alpha-alpha creation of 6Li in various
sites. We notably reject stellar flares as a significant source of 6Li in
HD84937.

spectral indices ranging between 0 and 3 with a mean value alpha_x ~ 1. This is
consistent with that of low-energy cutoff BL Lacs (LBL; alpha_x ~ 1.1),
generally found in radio surveys, but significantly different from that of
high-energy cutoff BL Lacs (HBL), normally selected in the X-ray band, which
display steeper X-ray spectra (alpha_x ~ 1.5). The shape of the
optical-to-X-ray continuum is concave (that is alpha_x < alpha_ox) for the
majority of FSRQ, as found for LBL, supporting a dominance of inverse Compton
emission in the X-ray band in most objects. Our results are at odds with
previous studies of the X-ray spectra of FSRQ, which were however plagued by
low spectral resolution and/or small number statistics and selection effects,
and have important implications for the proposed connections between FSRQ and
BL Lacs.

Hence, lensing is a very useful tool to study the universe at low to moderate
redshifts.
  We describe in detail a new method to trace light rays from redshift zero
through a three dimensional mass distribution to high redshift. As an example,
this method is applied here to a standard cold dark matter universe. We obtain
a variety of results, some of them statistical in nature, others from rather
detailed case studies of individual ``lines of sight"". Among the former are the
frequency of multiply imaged quasars, the distribution of separation of the
multiple quasars, and the redshift distribution of lenses: all that as a
function of quasar redshift. We find effects from very weak lensing to highly
magnified multiple images of high redshift objects, which, for extended
background sources, (i.e. galaxies), range from slight deformations of the
shapes through tangentially aligned arclets up to giant luminous arcs.
  Different cosmological models differ, increasingly with redshift, in their
predictions for the mass (thus gravitational potential) distributions. Our
ultimate goal is to apply this method to a number of cosmogonic models and to
eliminate some models whose gravitational lensing properties are inconsistent
with those observed.

``removable'' uncertainties due to physics at the electroweak and

of the effective Hamiltonian defines the True Effective Potential U_eff for
configurations far from thermal equilibrium. Numerically solving the time
evolution equations for energy densities corresponding to a quench in the
unstable spinodal region, we find results quite different from what might be
inferred from the equilibrium free energy ``effective'' potential F. Typical
time evolutions show effectively irreversible energy flow from the coherent
mean fields to the quantum fluctuating modes, due to the creation of massless
Goldstone bosons near threshold. The plasma frequency and collisionless damping
rate of the mean fields are calculated in terms of the particle number density
by a linear response analysis and compared with the numerical results.
Dephasing of the fluctuations leads also to the growth of an effective entropy

addition to casting some light on fundamental issues of nonequilibrium quantum
statistical mechanics, the general framework presented in this work may be
