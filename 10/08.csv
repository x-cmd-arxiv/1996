fluctuations in an expanding universe is studied. In the context of the
standard cosmological model and the peak $ansatz$, disk galaxies are supposed
to be the product of ""extended"" gravitational collapses of regions surrounding
local-maxima of the density fluctuation field. The substructure over the main
profile (merging) is considered as a second-order phenomenon. The range and
distribution of possible mass growth histories or accretion regimes for a given
present-day mass are estimated and used as the initial condition for galaxy
formation. Considering the effect of dark halo contraction due to disk
formation, the final rotation curves are calculated. If the structural
properties of dark halos are important in establishing the Hubble sequence's
properties of visible galaxies, then this sequence is defined not only by the
mass, but among other possible parameters, by the accretion regime.

over-density of galaxies (a factor of four over the number expected in an
unclustered universe) within the redshift range 0.530 < z < 0.555. By
considering the spatial distribution of galaxies within this redshift range
(using spectroscopic and photometric redshifts) we show that the galaxies in
SA68 form a linear structure passing from the South-West of the survey field
through to the North-East (with a position angle of approximately 35 deg East
of North). This position angle is coincident with the positions of the X-ray
clusters CL0016+16, RX J0018.3+1618 and a new X-ray cluster, RX J0018.8+1602,
centered near the radio source 54W084. All three of these sources are at a
redshift of approximately z=0.54 and have position angles, derived from their
X-ray photon distributions, consistent with that measured for the supercluster.
Assuming a redshift of 0.54 for the distribution of galaxies and a FWHM
dispersion in redshift of 0.020 this represents a coherent structure with a
radial extent of 31 Mpc, transverse dimension of 12 Mpc, and a thickness of
approximately 4 Mpc. The detection of this possible supercluster demonstrates
the power of using X-ray observations, combined with multicolor observations,
to map the large scale distribution of galaxies at intermediate redshifts.

to a control field far from the cluster center. As a result, the measured
decrement in the Rayleigh-Jeans temperature of the cosmic microwave background
is overestimated. We calculate the associated systematic bias which is
inevitably introduced into measurements of the Hubble constant using the SZ
effect. For the cluster A2218, we find that observations at 15 GHz with a beam
radius of 0'.4 and a source removal threshold of 100 microJy underestimate the

slightly lower than the average R for steep-spectrum quasars, but their radio
spectral properties are those of core-dominated quasars. It was proposed
previously that these sources might be relativistically boosted jets in
radio-weak quasars. Our VLBI observations now indeed confirm the presence of a
high brightness temperature core in all three of these objects --- two of them
have lower limits on T_B well in excess of 10^10 Kelvin. Moreover, we find no
``missing-flux'' which means that basically all the flux of these quasars is
concentrated in the compact radio core. As the total radio flux is already at
the low end for radio-loud quasars, we can place a strong limit on the presence
of any extended emission. This limit is consistent with the extended emission
in radio-weak quasars, but excludes that the flat-spectrum RIQ reside in
typical radio-loud quasars. The observations therefore strongly support the
idea that relativistic jets are present in radio-weak quasars and hence that
radio-loud and radio-weak quasars have very similar central engines.

degenerate band. Assuming that the lattice distortion is coupled to the orbital
electron density and the superconductivity arises due to BCS pairing mechanism
between the electrons, the phase diagram is obtained for different doping with
respect to half-filled band situation. The coexistence phase of
superconductivity and distortion occurs within limited range of doping and the
distortion lowers the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$. In presence
of strong electron-lattice interaction the lattice strain is found to be
maximum at half-filling and superconductivity does not appear for low doping.
The maximum value of $T_c$ obtainable for an optimum doping is limited by the
structural transition temperature $T_s$. The growth of distortion is arrested
with the onset of superconductivity and the distortion is found to disappear at
lower temperature for some hole density. Such arresting of the growth of
distortion at $T_c$ produces discontinuous jump in thermal expansion
coefficient. The variation of strain with temperature as well as with doping,
thermal expansion coefficient, the $T_c$ vs $\delta$ behaviour are in
qualitative agreement with recent experimental observations on interplay of

parameters. The WKB-RG analysis in the S-N region predicts a low temperature
instability i.e. a Quantum Induced Transition (QUIT). We carefully simulations
and carry out a finite size analysis of $T_{QUIT}$ as a function of the
magnitude of imaginary time axis $L_\tau$. We find that for some relatively
large values of $\alpha=E_C/E_J$ ($1\leq \alpha \leq 2.25)$, the

Maximum Detector diagonally off-set (SMD-dos) optimized for the separation of
\pi^0 showers from \gamma showers in the 30 to 150 GeV energy range. For 90%
\gamma acceptance the SMD-dos yields \pi^0 rejection efficiency of 92+-4%,
87+-4% and 32+-2%, respectively, for 30, 50 and 150 GeV incident energies. We
find that the SMD-dos is superior to a conventional geometry single-layer or
mutiple-layer shower maximum detector (SMD), of equal granularity, by an
average factor of ~1.5 over the 50 to 150 GeV energy range. We also find that
the SMD-dos gives better \pi^0 rejection, for the same number of channels, than
a SMD. At hadron - hadron colliders the signature of choice for the detection
of the Higgs particle, in the mass range of 120 to 160 GeV, is via the decay
H-->\gamma\gamma. The addition of a SMD-dos to the planned detectors at the LHC
would significantly reduce the background to the \gamma-signal coming from
prolific \pi^0 production.

investigated when the boundary state (`perturbative vacuum') at $t= \pm\infty$
includes gluons. Any boundary state that has an overlap with the true QCD
ground state generates a perturbative series that (when summed to all orders)
is formally exact. Through an analogy with the boundary condition corresponding
to a fermion condensate, I propose an explicit form for a `perturbative gluon
condensate' that suppresses low momentum gluon production, thus generating an
effective mass gap. Standard perturbative calculations are modified only
through a change in the $i\epsilon$ prescription of low momentum $(|\pv| \lsim
\Lambda_{QCD})$ gluon propagators. Gauge invariance is expected to be preserved
since this modification is equivalent to adding on-shell external particles.
Renormalizability is unaffected since only low-momentum propagators are
modified. Due to the asymptotic low momentum gluons boost invariance is not
explicit. Lorentz invariance should be restored in the sum to all orders in
analogy to standard bound state calculations.

parameter regions allowed under the constraints of radiative symmetry breaking,
perturbativity and proton stability, include the experimentally designated
domain for $\alpha_s$. In the case of the minimal $SU(5)$, the values of
$\alpha_s$ obtained are somewhat large in comparison with the experimental
average. The ``missing-doublet'' $SU(5)$, generally, predicts smaller values of
$\alpha_s$. In both versions of the ``missing-doublet'', the high energy
threshold effects on $\alpha_s$ operate in the opposite direction than in the
case of the minimal model, leading to small values. In the case of the
Peccei-Quinn version however the presence of an extra intermediate scale allows
to achieve an excellent agreement with the experimental $\alpha_s$ values.
Finally, the last considered version, with light remnants, exhibits unification
of couplings at string scale at the expense however of rather large $\alpha_s$
values.

(non-divergent) quantity of interest. We establish a monotonicity property with
respect to the couplings in the theory. As a consequence, the relative entropy
in a field theory with a hierarchy of renormalization group fixed points ranks
the fixed points in decreasing order of criticality. We argue from a
generalized $H$ theorem that Wilsonian RG flows induce an increase in entropy
and propose the relative entropy as the natural quantity which increases from
one fixed point to another in more than two dimensions.

calculate, for a collisional, highly viscous magnetofluid, the flows that are
required for an axisymmetric toroidal steady state, assuming uniform scalar
