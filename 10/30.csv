We calculate the X-ray and gamma-ray spectra of impulsive acceleration episodes
related to GRB pulses. We use the synchrotron shock model (SSM) as a basis of
our calculations. We show that the current data on soft-to-hard emission ratios
of GRB pulse emission are in agreement with the SSM. In particular, GRB pulse
emission detected by GINGA is in agreement with the SSM low-energy spectra. We
deduce that GINGA detected the majority of bright GRBs detectable by BATSE.
These results indicate that the physical environment surrounding the GRB
emission site is optically thin to X-ray photon energies. We also calculate
emission ratios in the Einstein, ROSAT, SAX and HETE energy bands, and discuss
how future information on simultaneous soft/hard GRB emission can contribute in
distinguishing different emission models. Two different components of X-ray
emission may simultaneously exist in a fraction of GRBs. One component is
clearly associated with the individual GRB pulses, and an additional component
may be related to the pulse X-ray spectral upturns and/or the precursors/tails
occasionally observed. We also show that a meaningful search of GRB-driven
X-ray flashes in Andromeda (M31) can be carried out with existing ROSAT data
and future SAX Wide Field Camera observations.

the observed emission line spectrum and line profiles while avoiding rapid
collisional destruction. Here, I investigate a third prediction of the model,
related to the size of the broad line region, by deriving the emission line
response to variations in the ionizing continuum (`line reverberation') and
comparing it to observations. The expected time lags, as well as the order of
response of the various lines, strongly depend on the typical variability time
scale of the ionizing continuum. The BS model studied here corresponds to a
bright Syfert 1 galaxy (Sy1) or a low luminosity QSO. I find that the BS model
is consistent with the observed correlation between the Balmer lines time lags
and the AGN luminosity, which at present is the only line reverberation
information available for this luminosity class. The model displays also some
of the anti-correlation between the time lags of the metal emission lines and
their degree of ionization that has been observed in a few low-luminosity Sy1s.
However, the bright Sy1 model results differs from the low-luminosity Sy1 data
in that the Hb time lag is relatively shorter and the CIV time lag relatively
longer.

Fermi acceleration due to scattering on moving plasma waves. This mechanism
leads to growing particle momentum dispersion and, at the same time, increases
the mean particle energy. In the most frequently met situations both processes
can be represented by a single momentum diffusion term in the particle kinetic
equation. In the present paper we discuss the conditions allowing the
additional term for regular acceleration to arise. For forward-backward
asymmetric scattering centres, besides the diffusive term one should explicitly
consider the regular acceleration term in momentum space, which can consist of
the first-order ($\propto V$), as well as the second-order ($\propto V^2$) part
in the wave velocity V . We derive the condition for the scattering probability
in the wave rest frame required for vanishing the regular acceleration term and
provide a simple mechanical example illustrating the theoretical concepts.
Finally, we address its possible role in cosmic ray acceleration processes.

regime. The excitation spectrum is shown rigorously to be gapless ( with gap )
for odd ( even ) m. In a general parameter regime, the four-chain and periodic
ladders are studied using a mean-field theory based on the bond operator
formalism for spin $S=1/2$. The excitation spectrum and the spin-gap are
calculated in both the cases. The spin-gap of the frustrated ladder system has
a larger magnitude than in the case of non-frustrated ladders. For the
frustrated periodic ladder, the spin-gap vanishes at a critical value of the
interladder coupling strength which is larger than the critical value in the
case of non-frustrated periodic ladder.

fixing are analysed. The Gribov ambiguity manifests by a nonuniqueness in the

subject to bag-type boundary-conditions at $x^1=0$ und $x^1=L$ is solved at
finite temperature $T=1/\beta$. The boundary conditions depend on a real
parameter $\theta$ and break the axial flavour symmetry. We argue that this
approach is more appropriate to study the broken phases than introducing small
quark masses, since all calculations can be performed analytically. In the
imaginary time formalism we determine the thermal correlators for the
fermion-fields and the determinant of the Dirac-operator in arbitrary
background gauge-fields. We show that the boundary conditions induce a CP-odd
$\theta$-term in the effective action. The chiral condensate, and in particular
its T- and L- dependence, is calculated for $N_f$ fermions. It is seen to
depend on the order in which the two lengths $\beta=1/T$ and $L$ are sent to
infinity.

were measured with movable multiple telescopes in an angular range of 6-90

solvable model based on the algebra SO(8). We look particularly closely at
Gamow-Teller strength and double beta decay, both to isolate the effects of the
two kinds of pairing and to test two approximation schemes: the renormalized
neutron-proton QRPA (RQRPA) and generalized BCS theory. When isoscalar pairing
correlations become strong enough a phase transition occurs and the dependence
of the Gamow-Teller beta+ strength on isospin changes in a dramatic and
unfamiliar way, actually increasing as neutrons are added to an N=Z core.
Renormalization eliminates the well-known instabilities that plague the QRPA as
the phase transition is approached, but only by unnaturally suppressing the
isoscalar correlations. Generalized BCS theory, on the other hand, reproduces
the Gamow-Teller strength more accurately in the isoscalar phase than in the
usual isovector phase, even though its predictions for energies are equally
good everywhere. It also mixes T=0 and T=1 pairing, but only on the isoscalar
side of the phase transition.

generating nonclassical states of light which exhibit clear signatures of phase
space interference. The Wigner function representing these states contains an
interference pattern manifesting quantum coherence between distinct phase space
components, and has substantial areas of negativity. We develop an analytical
description of the interference pattern, which demonstrates how the
oscillations of the Wigner function are built up by the superposition
principle. We analyze the impact of dissipation and pump fluctuations on the
visibility of the interference pattern; the results suggest that some
signatures of quantum coherence can be observed in the presence of moderate
amount of noise.
