luminosity function of globular clusters. For the three best studied systems,
in Milky Way, M31, and M87, there is a statistically significant difference
between the inner and outer population of globular clusters. In all cases the
inner clusters are on average brighter than the outer clusters ($0.26 < \Delta
m_0 < 0.84$) and have a smaller dispersion in magnitudes ($0.04 < \Delta \sigma
< 0.53$), with the larger differences for the local, better observed samples.
The differences are of the type that would be expected if the inner population
had been depleted by tidal shocks. The results suggest that the inner
population suffers substantial evolution from its initial distribution and
cannot not be used as a standard candle without correction for dynamical
evolution.

galaxy formation to recent epochs. We point out that the recently discovered
high redshift galaxy, 53W091, with accurate age measurements (Dunlop et al

$\Lambda$-dominated Universe, the redshift of formation of 53W091 decreases
with decreasing $\Omega$. However, in the modified CDM models decreasing
$\Omega$ suppresses the small scale power in the density field and this effect
turns out to be dominant. We estimate the mass of the galaxy and show that it

Similar problems would occur in other modifications of the CDM cosmogonies.

evaluate higher order moments, the n-point functions and their Fourier
transforms. We argue that this method is inefficient, due to the redundancy of
information existing in the complete set of moments. In this paper we propose a
set of new statistics or non-Gaussian spectra to be extracted out of the
angular distribution of the Fourier transform of the temperature anisotropies
in the small field limit. These statistics complement the power spectrum and
act as localization, shape, and connectedness statistics. They quantify generic
non-Gaussian structure, and may be used in more general image processing tasks.
We concentrate on a subset of these statistics and argue that while they carry
no information in Gaussian theories they may be the best arena for making
predictions in some non-Gaussian theories. As examples of applications we
consider superposed Gaussian and non-Gaussian signals, such as point sources in
Gaussian theories or the realistic Kaiser-Stebbins effect. We show that in
these theories non-Gaussianity is only present in a ring in Fourier space,
which is best isolated in our formalism. Subtle but strongly non-Gaussian
theories are also written down for which only non-Gaussian spectra may accuse
non-Gaussianity.

will pair produce on low-energy diffuse extragalactic background radiation

emission in the Universe. However, a VHE gamma-ray that pair produces initiates
an electromagnetic pair cascade. At low energies, this secondary cascade
radiation has a spectrum insensitive to the spectrum of the primary
gamma-radiation and, unlike the original VHE radiation, IS observable.
Motivated by new measurements of the extragalactic MeV-GeV diffuse gamma-ray
background, we discuss the constraints placed on cosmological VHE source
populations by requiring that the cascade background they produce not exceed
the observed levels. We use a new, accurate cascading code and pay particular
attention to the dependence of the constraints on the diffuse cosmic background
at infrared/optical wavelengths. Despite considerable uncertainty in this
background, we find that robust constraints may still be placed on the
integrated emissivity of potential VHE sources in the Universe. The limits are
tighter than those obtained by considering cascading on the microwave
background alone and restrict significantly, for example, the parameter space
available for the exotic particle physics scenarios recently proposed to
explain the highest energy cosmic ray events. If direct emission from blazar
AGN in fact accounts for most of the observed GeV background, these limits
strengthen and rule out AGN emission scenarios which produce significant power

anisotropy in the outer parts of the Galactic halo (r greater than approx 20

ellipsoid decreases fairly rapidly beyond the solar circle, from approx 140 +/-

rapid decrease in the radial velocity dispersion is matched by an increase in

edge undergoes significant variability on a timescale as low as $\sim 10^4 s$,

the absorbing matter. In the self-consistent hypothesis of a high energy ($E

different structures. The regular magnetic field in the halo is axisymmetric
and horizontal. Its field lines are spirals pointing inwards and generally
opposite to those in the disk. The azimuthal structure of the magnetic field in
the disk is neither axisymme- tric nor bisymmetric but can be represented by a
superposition of these two basic harmonics with about equal weights. Magnetic
lines of the regular field in the disk are spirals generally directed outwards.
They are well aligned with the optical spiral arms as traced by the dust lanes.

are in good agreement with independent estimates from the synchrotron emission.

its amplitudes are obtained in terms of level-dependent scaling functions.
Exactly on the phase boundary, the amplitudes are proportional to a sum of
square-root of integers and an anomaly term. By summing over all low-lying
levels, the partition functions are obtained explicitly. Similar analysis is
performed also at the phase boundary of zero horizontal field in which case the
energy gaps scale as $N^{-2}$. The partition functions for this case are found
to be that of a nonrelativistic free fermion system. From symmetry of the

The energy thresholds for quasiparticle propagation in the superconductor are
sensitive to the existence of condensate flow ($v_s\neq 0$). This dependence is
responsible for a rich variety of transport regimes, including a voltage range
in which only Andreev transmission is possible at the interfaces, and a state
of gapless superconductivity which may survive up to high voltages if
temperature is low. The two main effects of current conservation are a shift
towards lower voltages of the first peak in the differential conductance and an
enhancement of current caused by the greater availability of charge

which is devoted to the search for the lightest scalar glueball. In the
framework of the K-matrix formalism, the $q\bar q$-nonet classification of the
scalar/isoscalar states is performed in the mass region below 1900 MeV basing
on the following data: GAMS data for $\pi^-p\to\pi^0\pi^0n$, $\eta\eta n$,
$\eta\eta'n$; CERN-M\""unich data for $\pi^-p\to\pi^+\pi^-n$; Crystal Barrel
data for $p\bar p\to\pi^0\pi^0\pi^0$, $\pi^0\pi^0\eta$, $\pi^0\eta\eta$; BNL
data for $\pi\pi\to K\overline K$. It is shown the existence of an extra state
for $q\bar q$ classification: this state is a good candidate for the lightest
scalar glueball. Analysis of the glueball/$q\bar q$ mixing shows that the
glueball state has mainly dispersed over three real resonances: $f_0(1300)$,
$f_0(1500)$ and $f_0(1530^{+90}_{-250})$. The broad resonance with complex mass
$m=1530^{+90}_{-250}-i(560\pm 140)$ MeV is descendant of the pure glueball. The
restored mass of the pure glueball is equal to 1695 MeV. This value agrees well
with the results of lattice gluodynamics.

concerned with conformal field theory based on affine $SL(2)$ current algebra,
in particular for admissible representations which are relevant in the
$SL(2)/SL(2)$ description of coupling conformal minimal matter to 2D gravity.
By virtue of fractional calculus, free field realizations are made applicable
of producing integral representations of chiral blocks, even in the case of
admissible representations where ghost fields raised to fractional powers are
inherent. The famous work on minimal models by Dotsenko and Fateev is then
generalised, working out monodromy invariant 4-point Greens functions and the
operator algebra coefficients. Furthermore, the fusion rules are re-derived
within the context of free field realizations by introducing the notion of
over-screening. For higher groups an explicit Wakimoto free field realization
is presented of affine current algebras based on simple Lie groups.
Furthermore, a study is undertaken of primary fields in the framework of extra
$x$ variables, and screening currents of both kinds are discussed. Several new
and definite results are presented. A quantum group structure relying on both
kinds of screening currents is discussed along the lines of Gomez and Sierra.

is smaller than for ordinary scalars and depends on other properties of the
black hole than just the horizon area. In the D-brane description, fixed scalar
absorption is suppressed because these scalars must split into at least four,
rather than two, open strings running along the D-brane. Consequently, this
comparison provides a more sensitive test of the effective string picture of
the D-brane bound state than does the cross-section for ordinary scalars. In
particular, it allows us to read off the value of the effective string tension.

history are independent, before their interaction. This principle is
time-asymmetric, for no such restriction applies to systems with no common
future, after an interaction. The time-asymmetry is normally attributed to
boundary conditions. I argue that there are two distinct independence
principles of this kind at work in contemporary physics, one of which cannot be
attributed to boundary conditions, and therefore conflicts with the assumed T
(or CPT) symmetry of microphysics. I note that this may have interesting
ramifications in quantum mechanics.

viewpoint of what is in a broad sense called the measurement problem in quantum
mechanics. Standard quantum theory in coherent state representation is
intrinsically related to a number of earlier concepts conciliating quantum and
classical processes. From a natural statistical interpretation, free of
collapses or measurements, the usual von Neumann-L\""uders collapse as well as
its quantum state diffusion interpretation follow. In particular, a theory of
coupled quantum and classical dynamics arises, containing the fluctuation
corrections versus the fenomenological mean-field theories.

transition, and letting the interaction times between the atoms and the cavity
be randomly distributed, we end up with a predetermined Fock state of the
electromagnetic field inside the cavity if we perform after the interaction
with the cavity a conditional measurement of the internal state of each atom in
a coherent superposition of its ground and excited states. Differently from
previous schemes, this procedure turns out to be very stable under fluctuations
in the interaction times.
