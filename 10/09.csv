intermediate magnitudes (-22.0 < M_V < -20.5), core and power-law galaxies
coexist, and there is a range in r_b at a given luminosity of at least two
orders of magnitude. Central properties correlate with global rotation and
shape: core galaxies tend to be boxy and slowly rotating, whereas power-law
galaxies tend to be disky and rapidly rotating. The dense power-law centers of
disky, rotating galaxies are consistent with their formation in gas-rich
mergers. The parallel proposition that cores are simply the by-products of
gas-free stellar mergers is less compelling. For example, core galaxies accrete
small, dense, gas-free galaxies at a rate sufficient to fill in low-density
cores if the satellites survived and sank to the center. An alternative model
for core formation involves the orbital decay of massive black holes (BHs): the
BH may heat and eject stars from the center, eroding a power law if any exists
and scouring out a core. An average BH mass per spheroid of 0.002 times the
stellar mass yields reasonably good agreement with the masses and radii of
observed cores and in addition is consistent with the energetics of AGNs and
kinematic detections of BHs in nearby galaxies.

exponentially with the number of wells in an usual disordered superlattice for
any value of the incident particle energy, for specific values of the incident
energy this time increases linearly when correlated disorder is included. As
expected, those values of the energy coincide with a narrow subband of extended
states predicted by the static calculations of Dom\'{\i}nguez-Adame {\em et
al.} [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 51}, 14 ,359 (1994)]; such states are seen in our
dynamical results to exhibit a ballistic regime, very close to the WKB
approximation of a perfect superlattice. Fourier transform of the output signal
for an incident Gaussian wave packet reveals a dramatic filtering of the
original signal, which makes us confident that devices based on this property
may be designed and used for nanotechnological applications. This is more so in
view of the possibility of controllingthe outp ut band using a dc electric
field, which we also discuss. In the conclusion we summarize our results and

states of uniform and dimerized alternating spin chains. The DMRG procedure is
also employed to obtain low-temperature thermodynamic properties of the system.
The ground state of a 2N spin system with spin-1 and spin-1/2 alternating from
site to site and interacting via an antiferromagnetic exchange is found to be
ferrimagnetic with total spin $s_G=N/2$ from both DMRG and spin wave analysis.
Both the studies also show that there is a gapless excitation to a state with
spin $s_G-1$ and a gapped excitation to a state with spin $s_G+1$.
Surprisingly, the correlation length in the ground state is found to be very
small from both the studies for this gapless system. For this very reason, we
show that the ground state can be described by a variational ``ansatz'' of the
product type. DMRG analysis shows that the chain is susceptible to a
conditional spin-Peierls' instability. The DMRG studies of magnetization,
magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) and specific heat show strong magnetic-field
dependence. The product $\chi T$ shows a minimum as a function of
temperature($T$) at low-magnetic fields and the minimum vanishes at
high-magnetic fields. This low-field behaviour is in agreement with earlier
experimental observations. The specific heat shows a maximum as a function of
temperature and the height of the maximum increases sharply at high magnetic
fields. It is hoped that these studies will motivate experimental studies at
high-magnetic fields.

surfaces into space. We adapt the approach of Dennis Sullivan, which treats a
spin structure on a Riemann surface M as a complex line bundle S whose square
is the canonical line bundle K=T(M). Given a conformal immersion of M into
\bbR^3, the unique spin strucure on S^2 pulls back via the Gauss map to a spin
structure S on M, and gives rise to a pair of smooth sections (s_1,s_2) of S.
Conversely, any pair of sections of S generates a (possibly periodic) conformal
immersion of M under a suitable integrability condition, which for a minimal
surface is simply that the spinor sections are meromorphic. A spin structure S
also determines (and is determined by) the regular homotopy class of the
immersion by way of a \bbZ_2-quadratic form q_S. We present an analytic
expression for the Arf invariant of q_S, which decides whether or not the
correponding immersion can be deformed to an embedding. The Arf invariant also
turns out to be an obstruction, for example, to the existence of certain
complete minimal immersions. The later parts of this paper use the spinor
representation to investigate minimal surfaces with embedded planar ends. In
general, we show for a spin structure S on a compact Riemann surface M with
punctures at P that the space of all such (possibly periodic) minimal
immersions of M\setminus P into \bbR^3 (upto homothety) is the the product of
S^1\times H^3 with the Grassmanian of 2-planes in a complex vector space \calK
of meromorphic sections of S. An important tool -- a skew-symmetric form \Omega
defined by residues of a certain meromorphic quadratic differential on M --
lets us compute how \calK varies as M and P are varied. Then we apply this to
determine the moduli spaces of planar-ended minimal spheres and real projective
planes, and also to construct a new family of minimal tori and a minimal Klein
bottle with 4 ends. These surfaces compactify in S^3 to yield surfaces critical
for the \Moebius invariant squared mean curvature functional W. On the other
hand, Robert Bryant has shown all W-critical spheres and real projective planes
arise this way. Thus we find at the same time the moduli spaces of W-critical
spheres and real projective planes via the spinor representation.

neglected in previous nucleon decay calculations, not only contributes
significantly to nucleon decay, but, for many values of the initial GUT
parameters and for large $\tan\beta$, actually dominates the decay rate. As a
consequence, we find that $\tau_p/\tau_n$ is often substantially larger than
the prediction obtained in small $\tan\beta$ models. We also find that
gluino-dressed diagrams, often neglected in nucleon decay calculations,
contribute significantly to nucleon decay. In addition we find that the
branching ratios obtained from this realistic SO(10) SUSY GUT differ

Planck scale should be described by means of concepts taken from ``discrete
mathematics''. This goal is realized by developing a scheme being based on the
dynamical evolution of a particular class of ``cellular networks'' being
capable of performing an ``unfolding phase transition'' from a (presumed)
chaotic initial phase towards a new phase which acts as an ``attractor'' in
total phase space and which carries a fine or super structure which is
identified as the discrete substratum underlying ordinary continuous space-time
(or rather, the physical vacuum). Among other things we analyze the internal
structure of certain particular subclusters of nodes/bonds (maximal connected
subsimplices, $mss$) which are the fundamental building blocks of this new
phase and which are conjectured to correspond to the ``physical points'' of
ordinary space-time. Their mutual entanglement generates a certain near- and
far-order, viz. a causal structure within the network which is again set into
relation with the topological/metrical and causal/geometrical structure of
continuous space-time. The mathematical techniques to be employed consist
mainly of a blend of a fair amount of ``stochastic mathematics'' with several
relatively advanced topics of discrete mathematics like the ``theory of random
graphs'' or ``combinatorial graph theory''. Our working philosophy is it to
create a scenario in which it becomes possible to identify both gravity and
quantum theory as the two dominant but derived(!) aspects of an underlying
discrete and more primordial theory (dynamical cellular network) on a much
coarser level of resolution, viz. continuous space-time.
