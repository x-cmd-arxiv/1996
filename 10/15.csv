holes with masses in excess of $10^8\Msun$. Bondi accretion from the
interstellar medium might then be expected to produce quasar-like luminosities
from the nuclei of even quiescent elliptical galaxies. It is a puzzle that such
luminosities are not observed. Motivated by this problem, Fabian & Rees have
recently suggested that the final stages of accretion in these objects occurs
in an advection-dominated mode with a correspondingly small radiative
efficiency. Despite possessing a long-known active nucleus and dynamical
evidence for a black hole, the low radiative and kinetic luminosities of the
core of M87 provide the best illustration of this problem. We examine an
advection-dominated model for the nucleus of M87 and show that accretion at the
Bondi rate is compatible with the best known estimates for the core flux from
radio through to X-ray wavelengths. The success of this model prompts us to
propose that FR-I radio galaxies and quiescent elliptical galaxies accrete in
an advection dominated mode whereas FR-II type radio-loud nuclei possess
radiatively efficient thin accretion disks.

famous example is the Galactic Center source Sgr A*. Recent studies of proper
motions and radial velocities of stars in the inner parsec of the Galaxy
convincingly demonstrate the presence of a compact dark mass of 2.5 10^6 Mo in
the nucleus of the Milky Way. Millimeter VLBI and submm observations of Sgr A*
thus probe a region of only a few Schwarzschild radii in diameter. In this
paper I will review our current theoretical and observational knowledge of this
source and compare it to some famous LINER galaxies like NGC 4258, NGC 3079,
and NGC 6500. In all cases these radio cores can be well explained by a
standard AGN jet model, and, with the exception of Sgr A*, large scale outflows
are observed that have powers comparable to those inferred from the radio
cores. Recent VLBI observations of radio-weak quasars and HST observations of
Seyfert galaxies indicate that these AGN also produce powerful jets which,
however, have relatively less luminous radio cores than radio-loud quasars and
the LINERs discussed here. Therefore, jets and compact radio cores appear to be
natural constituents of an AGN, but the reason why apparently some jets are
radio-loud and others not remains a mystery.

spectrum of the stadium billiard can be adequately described, semiclassically,
by the Gutzwiller periodic orbit trace formula together with a modified
treatment of the marginally stable family of bouncing ball orbits. I show that
this belief is erroneous. The Gutzwiller trace formula is not applicable for
the phase space dynamics near the bouncing ball orbits. Unstable periodic
orbits close to the marginally stable family in phase space cannot be treated
as isolated stationary phase points when approximating the trace of the Green
function. Semiclassical contributions to the trace show an $\hbar$ - dependent
transition from hard chaos to integrable behavior for trajectories approaching
the bouncing ball orbits. A whole region in phase space surrounding the
marginal stable family acts, semiclassically, like a stable island with
boundaries being explicitly $\hbar$-dependent. The localized bouncing ball
states found in the billiard derive from this semiclassically stable island.
The bouncing ball orbits themselves, however, do not contribute to individual
eigenvalues in the spectrum. An EBK-like quantization of the regular bouncing
ball eigenstates in the stadium can be derived. The stadium billiard is thus an
ideal model for studying the influence of almost regular dynamics near
marginally stable boundaries on quantum mechanics.

expressed in terms of integrals over surfaces, at the horizon and spatial
infinity, of a stationary, axisymmetric black hole, in a diffeomorphism
invariant Lagrangian theory of gravity. The original statement of the first law
given by Bardeen, Carter and Hawking for an Einstein-perfect fluid system
contained, in addition, volume integrals of the fluid fields, over a spacelike
slice stretching between these two surfaces. When applied to the
Einstein-perfect fluid system, however, Wald's methods yield restricted
results. The reason is that the fluid fields in the Lagrangian of a gravitating
perfect fluid are typically nonstationary. We therefore first derive a first
law-like relation for an arbitrary Lagrangian metric theory of gravity coupled
to arbitrary Lagrangian matter fields, requiring only that the metric field be
stationary. This relation includes a volume integral of matter fields over a
spacelike slice between the black hole horizon and spatial infinity, and
reduces to the first law originally derived by Bardeen, Carter and Hawking when
the theory is general relativity coupled to a perfect fluid. We also consider a
specific Lagrangian formulation for an isentropic perfect fluid given by
Carter, and directly apply Wald's analysis. The resulting first law contains
only surface integrals at the black hole horizon and spatial infinity, but this
relation is much more restrictive in its allowed fluid configurations and
perturbations than that given by Bardeen, Carter and Hawking. In the Appendix,
we use the symplectic structure of the Einstein-perfect fluid system to derive
a conserved current for perturbations of this system: this current reduces to
one derived ab initio for this system by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari.

usually associated with the ``bad'' behaviour of the bare lattice coupling g_0
due to the effects of large (and unknown) higher order coefficients in the g_0
perturbative series. In this philosophy a new, renormalised coupling g' is
defined with the aim of reducing the higher order coefficients of the
perturbative series in g'. An improvement in the agreement between lattice data
and this new perturbation series is generally observed.
  In this paper an alternative scenario is discussed where lattice artifacts
are proposed as the cause of the disagreement between lattice data and the
g_0-perturbative series. We find that this interpretation provides excellent
agreement between lattice data and perturbation theory in g_0 corrected for
lattice artifacts. We show that this viewpoint leads typically to an order of
magnitude improvement in the agreement between lattice data and perturbation
theory, compared to typical g' perturbation expansions. The success of this
procedure leads to a determination of Lambda_MSbar^{N_f=0} of 220 +- 20 MeV.

hadronic scale r_0, the discrete beta function Delta\beta, M_rho, f_pi and the

off-shell superdiffeomorphism invariance (in the rheonomic sense) of the
superparticle generalized action is proved. It was demonstrated that the half
of the fermionic and one bosonic (super)fields disappear from the generalized
action in the analytical basis. Superparticle interaction with Abelian gauge
theory is considered in the framework of this formulation. The geometric
approach equations describing superparticle motion in Abelian background are
obtained.

  Main Theorem. Let $A$ be an abelian variety of complex dimension $n$ and $D$
be an ample divisor in $A$. Let $f:{\bf C}\rightarrow A$ be a holomorphic map.
Then the defect for the map $f$ and the divisor $D$ is zero.
  Corollary to Main Theorem. The complement of an ample divisor $D$ in an
abelian variety $A$ is hyperbolic in the sense that there is no nonconstant
holomorphic map from $\bf C$ to $A-D$.

the enrichment of the theory of compacta, especially the theory of continua,

the following conditions (B), (M) and (D). Condition (B) states that there is a
disjoint family F subseteq P(X) of size c, consisting of Borel sets which are
not in I. Condition (M) states that there is a function f:X-> X with
f^{-1}[{x}] notin I for each x in X. Provided that X is a group and I is
invariant, condition (D) states that there exist a Borel set B notin I and a
perfect set P subseteq X for which the family {B+x: x in P} is disjoint. The
aim of the paper is to study whether the reverse implications in the chain (D)
=> (M) => (B) => not-ccc can hold. We build a sigma-ideal on the Cantor group
witnessing''(M) and not (D)'' (Section 2). A modified version of that
sigma-ideal contains the whole space (Section 3). Some consistency results
deriving (M) from (B) for''nicely'' defined ideals are established (Section 4).
We show that both ccc and (M) can fail (Theorems 1.3 and 4.2). Finally, some
sharp versions of (M) for invariant ideals on Polish groups are investigated
(Section 5).

corrections. They can be cast in Hamiltonian form and are shown to double the
number of degrees of freedom. As a consequence chaotic behavior emerges. We
show that this semiquantal chaos is the mechanism trough which tunneling is
effected. We also show that these corrections systematically improve the
classical results and propose some quantitative measure of this improvement.
