spectacular flare of radio source PKS 1622-297. A peak flux of 17E-6 cm^-2 s^-1
(E > 100 MeV) was observed. The corresponding isotropic luminosity is 2.9E49
erg/s. We find that PKS 1622-297 exhibits gamma-ray intra-day variability. A
flux increase by a factor of at least 3.6 was observed to occur in less than
7.1 hours (with 99% confidence). Assuming an exponential rise, the
corresponding doubling time is less than 3.8 hours. A significant flux decrease
by a factor of ~2 in 9.7 hours was also observed. Without beaming, the rapid
flux change and large isotropic luminosity are inconsistent with the
Elliot-Shapiro condition (assuming that gas accretion is the immediate source
of power for the gamma-rays). This inconsistency suggests that the gamma-ray
emission is beamed. A minimum Doppler factor of 8.1 is implied by the observed
lack of pair-production opacity (assuming x-rays are emitted co-spatially with
the gamma-rays). Simultaneous observation by EGRET and OSSE finds a spectrum
adequately fit by a power law with photon index of -1.9. Although the
significance is not sufficient to establish this beyond doubt, the high-energy
gamma-ray spectrum appears to evolve from hard to soft as a flare progresses.

4736. Two bright sources are detected, separated by only about 1', with the
brighter one coinciding with the center of the galaxy. Neither source shows
apparent X-ray variability on time-scales of minutes to hours in the ROSAT
band. Simple power-law models, typical of AGN X-ray spectra, produce poor fits
to the observed X-ray spectrum of the nuclear source. The addition of a
Raymond-Smith component improves the fits significantly. This is consistent
with the presence of hot gas in the nuclear region with kT=~0.3 keV, in
addition to a compact nuclear source. However, a careful examination of the
residuals reveal apparent features at low energies (< 0.25 keV). We find that
the addition of a narrow emission line at about 0.22 keV is a significant
improvement to the parameterization of the spectrum. We examine the results in
the light of the accuracy of the PSPC spectral calibration. The derived photon
index is about 2.3, which is similar to those for Seyfert 1 galaxies measured
in the ROSAT energy range. On the other hand, the 0.1-2 keV luminosity for the
compact source is only about 3.4x10^{39} erg/s, much fainter than typical
Seyfert galaxies. We discuss the implications of these results on the
connection between LINERs and AGNs.
  The off-center source is transient in nature. It has a hard X-ray spectrum,
with a photon index of about 1.5, so is likely to be an X-ray binary. There is
still some ambiguity regarding its association with the galaxy. If it is indeed
located in the galaxy, the 0.1-2 keV luminosity would be greater than
5.1x10^{38} erg/s, making it a stellar-mass black hole candidate.

characterising the morphology of the basin. In the context of a finite size
scaling Ansatz, the exponents describing the power law behaviour are calculated
exactly and show mean field behaviour, except for two limiting values of a
parameter characterizing the dissipated energy, for which the system belongs to
different universality classes. Two modified versions of the model,
incorporating quenched disorder are considered: the first simulates
heterogeneities in the local properties of the soil, the second considers the
effects of a non-uniform rainfall. In the region of mean field behaviour, the
model is shown to be robust to both kinds of perturbations. In the two limiting
cases the random rainfall is still irrelevant, whereas the heterogeneity in the

at all finite temperatures, a transition to fracture under applied load similar
to that at a first order liquid-gas transition. We study this transition at low
temperature for small tension. We discuss the appropriate thermodynamic limit
of these theories: a large class of boundary conditions is identified for which
the energy release for a crack becomes independent of the macroscopic shape of
the material. Using the complex variable method in a two-dimensional elastic
theory, we prove that the energy release in an isotropically stretched material
due to the creation of an arbitrary curvy cut is the same to cubic order as the
energy release for the straight cut with the same end points. We find the
normal modes and the energy spectrum for crack shape fluctuations and for crack
surface phonons, under a uniform isotropic tension. For small uniform isotropic
tension in two dimensions we calculate the essential singularity associated
with fracturing the material in a saddle point approximation including
quadratic fluctuations. This singularity determines the lifetime of the
material (half-life for fracture), and also determines the asymptotic
divergence of the high-order corrections to the zero temperature elastic
coefficients. We calculate the asymptotic ratio of the high-order elastic
coefficients of the inverse bulk modulus and argue that the result is unchanged
by nonlinearities --- the ratio of the high-order nonlinear terms are
determined solely by the linear theory.

have exponentially decaying winding angle distributions, the decay constant
depending on whether the interaction is repulsive or neutral, but not on
microscopic details. In the presence of a chiral asymmetry, the exponential
tails become non universal. In all these cases the mean winding angle is
proportional to $\ln t$. When the polymer is confined to a finite region around
the winding center, e.g. due to an attractive interaction, the winding angle
distribution is Gaussian, with a variance proportional to $t$. We also examine
the windings of polymers in random systems. Our results suggest that randomness
reduces entanglements, leading to a narrow (Gaussian) distribution with a mean
winding angle of the order of $\sqrt{\ln t}$.

include, in particular, one parameter class of theories continuously connecting
the Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) gravity and the low energy string
effective theory. When there is no $U(1)$ charge, we have $O(2)$ or $O(1,1)$
symmetry, depending on a parameter that specifies each theory. Via the $Z_2$
transformation, we obtain exact magnetically charged solutions from the known
electrically charged solutions. We explain the relationship between the $Z_2$

string theory.

Bruna, Nicolau, and \O yma about interpolating sequences in the same spaces,
and it yields sampling sets which do not depend on the value of $p$ and
correspond to the result proved for bounded functions ($p=\infty$) by Brown,
Shields and Zeller. The second notion, while formally closer to the one used
for weighted Bergman spaces, is shown to lead to trivial situations only, but
raises a possibly interesting problem.

  operators",,,,"Banach Archive 10/2/96","math.FA",,"  A basic sequence in a Banach space is called wide-$(s)$ if it is bounded and
dominates the summing basis. (Wide-$(s)$ sequences were originally introduced
by I.~Singer, who termed them $P^*$-sequences). These sequences and their
quantified versions, termed $\lambda$-wide-$(s)$ sequences, are used to
characterize various classes of operators between Banach spaces, such as the
weakly compact, Tauberian, and super-Tauberian operators, as well as a new
intermediate class introduced here, the strongly Tauberian operators. This is a
nonlocalizable class which nevertheless forms an open semigroup and is closed
under natural operations such as taking double adjoints. It is proved for
example that an operator is non-weakly compact iff for every $\varepsilon >0$,
it maps some $(1+\varepsilon)$-wide-$(s)$-sequence to a wide-$(s)$ sequence.
This yields the quantitative triangular arrays result characterizing
reflexivity, due to R.C.~James. It is shown that an operator is non-Tauberian
(resp. non-strongly Tauberian) iff for every $\varepsilon>0$, it maps some
$(1+\varepsilon)$-wide-$(s)$ sequence into a norm-convergent sequence (resp. a
sequence whose image has diameter less than $\varepsilon$). This is applied to
obtain a direct ``finite'' characterization of super-Tauberian operators, as
well as the following characterization, which strengthens a recent result of
M.~Gonz\'alez and A.~Mart{\'\i}nez-Abej\'on: An operator is non-super-Tauberian
iff there are for every $\varepsilon>0$, finite $(1+\varepsilon)$-wide-$(s)$
sequences of arbitrary length whose images have norm at most $\varepsilon$.

interactions are derived as the multipole pairing interactions in
doubly-stretched coordinates. They are applied to the microscopic analysis of
the giant dipole resonances (GDR's) of ${}^{148,154}Sm$, the first excited
$2^+$ states of Sn isotopes and the first excited $3^-$ states of Mo isotopes.

relativistic Fermi gas are compared. Both of them divide the charge response by
a normalizing factor such that the reduced response thus obtained fulfills the
sum rule at large momentum transfer. To determine the factor, in the first
approach one exploits the scaling property of the longitudinal response
function, while in the second one enforces the completeness of the states in
the space-like domain via the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The
energy-weighted and the squared-energy-weighted sum rules for the reduced
responses are explored as well and the extension to momentum distributions that
are more general than a step-function is also considered. The two methods yield
reduced responses and Coulomb sum rules that saturate in the non-Pauli-blocked
region, which can hardly be distinguished for Fermi momenta appropriate to
atomic nuclei. Notably the sum rule obtained in the Foldy-Wouthuysen approach
coincides with the well known non-relativistic one. Only at quite large
momentum transfers (say 1 GeV/c) does a modest softening of the
Foldy-Wouthuysen reduced response with respect to that obtained in the scaling
framework show up. The two responses have the same half-width to second order
in the Fermi momentum expansion. However, when distributions extending to
momenta larger than that at the Fermi surface are employed, then in both
methods the Coulomb sum rule saturates only if the normalizing factors are
appropriately modified to account for the high momentum components of the
nucleons.

one can show that there are approximate Liouville operators independent of the
