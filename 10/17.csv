break to a flat slope at faint fluxes. The surface density of QSOs at the

survey. We have used this survey to measure the QSO X-ray luminosity function
at low luminosities (Lx<10^{44.5} erg s^{-1}) and high redshifts (1<z<2.5). The
highest redshift QSO in the survey has z=3.4. Combined with the QSOs from the
Einstein EMSS at bright fluxes, we find pure luminosity evolution of the form
Lx proportional to (1+z)^{3.0(+0.2,-0.3)} is an adequate description of the
evolution of the X-ray luminosity function at low redshifts. A redshift cutoff
in the evolution is required at z=1.4 ^{+0.4}_{-0.17} (for qo=0.5). We discuss
the form of this evolution, its dependence on the model assumed and the errors
on the derived parameters. We show that most previous X-ray surveys, including
the EMSS, are consistent with a power law luminosity evolution index of 3.0.
The contribution of QSOs to the 1-2 keV cosmic X-ray background is found to be
between 31% and 51%.

type-1 active galactic nuclei using the medium spectral resolution of ``ASCA''.
The sample consists of 20 radio-quiet objects and 4 radio-loud objects. A
simple power-law continuum absorbed by Galactic material provides a very poor
description of the spectra of most objects. Deviations from the power-law form
are interpreted in terms of X-ray reprocessing/absorption processes. In
particular, at least half of the objects show K-shell absorption edges of warm
oxygen (O vii and O viii) characteristic of optically-thin, photoionized
material along the line-of-sight to the central engine, the so-called warm
absorber. It is found that objects with significant optical reddening display
deep O vii edges. Coupled with other evidence, this suggests the existence of
dusty warm plasma. A radiatively driven outflow originating from the molecular
torus is probably the source of this plasma. Rapid variability of the warm
absorber also points to there being another component closer to the central
source and probably situated within the broad line region.
  Spectral features at energies characteristic of cold fluorescent iron
K$\alpha$ emission are common. Radio-quiet objects have iron emission well
described as originating from either the inner regions of an accretion disk or,
in a small number of cases, from the molecular torus. Two of the radio-loud
objects (3C~120 and 3C~382) have a much broader feature which presents problems
for the relativistic disk model. The presence of radio-jets may be important in
forming this spectral feature.

each of these, the physics of the boundary layer between the disk and the star

  We assess the importance of the methods listed above for heating the star in

tends to be the most important source of stellar heating in thin disk systems

direct radiation across the disk-star interface will be unimportant in

cosmological neighborhood is mapped back in time to the CMB in two ways. First,
the density power spectrum ($P_k$) is translated into a temperature angular
power spectrum of sub-degree resolution ($C_l$) and compared to observations.
Second, the local density field is translated into a temperature map in a patch
on the last-scattering surface of a distant observer. A likelihood analysis of
the Mark III peculiar velocity data have constrained the range of parameters
for $P_k$ within the family of COBE-normalized CDM models (Zaroubi et al 1996),
favoring a slight tilt in the initial spectrum, $n<1$. The corresponding range
of $C_l$'s is plotted against current observations, indicating that the CMB
data can tighten the constraints further: only models with ``small'' tilt
($n\sim 0.9$) and ``high'' baryonic content ($\Omega_b \sim 0.1$) could survive
the two data sets simultaneously. The local mass density field that has been
recovered from the velocities via a Wiener method is convolved with a Boltzmann
calculation to recover $10'$ resolution temperature maps as viewed from
different directions. The extent of the CMB patch and the amplitude of
fluctuations depend on the choice of cosmological parameters, e.g., the local
$100\hmpc$ sphere corresponds to $90'$ to $30'$ at the CMB for $\Omega$ between
1 and 0 respectively. The phases of the temperature map are correlated with
those of the density field, contrary to the contribution of the Sachs-Wolfe
effect alone. This correlation suggests the possibility of an inverse
reconstruction of the underlying density field from CMB data with interesting
theoretical implications.

We fit h-, Omega_b- and lambda-dependent power spectra to the data. The models
we consider are flat cold dark matter (CDM) dominated universes with flat (n=1)
power spectra, thus the results obtained apply only to these models. CMB
observations can exclude more than half of the h - Omega_b parameter space
explored. The CMB data favor low values of Hubble's constant; h \approx 0.35.
Low values of Omega_b are preferred (Omega_b ~ 0.03) but the chi-squared
minimum is shallow and we obtain Omega_b < 0.28. A model with h \approx 0.40,
Omega_b \approx 0.15 and Omega_CDM \approx 0.85 is permitted by constraints
from the CMB data, BBN, cluster baryon fractions and the shape parameter Gamma
derived from the mass density power spectra of galaxies and clusters. For
flat-lambda models, the CMB data, combined with BBN constraints exclude most of
the h - lambda plane. Models with Omega_o \approx 0.3, lambda \approx 0.7 with
h \approx 0.75 are fully consistent with the CMB data but are excluded by the
strict new q_{o} limits from supernovae (Perlmutter et al. 1996). A combination
of CMB data goodness-of-fit statistics, BBN and supernovae constraints in the

C, N, O, S and Ne), which allow us to obtain a moderately accurate estimate of
the non-equilibrium radiative cooling function. We evaluate the accuracy of
this approach by comparing our cooling function with previous calculations,
computed with a more extended set of ions, for the case of gas that cools from
a high temperature at constant density. We also compute steady, plane shock
models, which we find to compare well with models calculated with much more
detailed microphysics. Using our reduced set of rate equations, we present a
simulation of a radiative bow shock formed by a supersonic, plane stream
impinging on a rigid sphere. The parameters for the calculation are chosen as
to approximately represent typical values found for Herbig-Haro objects, and to
give a cooling distance to bow shock radius ratio of 1/10. This simulation is
done with an adaptive grid code, which allows a reasonably high resolution
(with greater than or equal to 25 points) of the standoff distance between the
bow shock and the rigid obstacle. Contrary to the standard expectation, we find
that the bow shock standoff distance in the stagnation region is considerably
shorter than the cooling distance behind a plane-parallel shock. Also, the
centrifugal pressure is found to play an important role in determining the
structure of the recombin- ation region. This appears to partially invalidate
previous bow shock models based on a ``quasi-1D'' approach, at least for the
particular parameters chosen for the present simulation. Finally, we present
tabulations of the cooling rates that have been used (for the different
species), in order to facilitate the inclusion of this treatment in other
gasdynamic codes.

small. The main systematic error, corresponding to $\pm 0.18$ in the above

non-perturbative evaluation of these constants will help to reduce the final

systems, such as electromagnetic or acoustic waves, is described. This theory
provides a realization of the theorem of Foias and Nagy; there is a subspace of
the Hilbert space in which the unitary evolution of the system, restricted to
this subspace, is realized as a semigroup. The embedding of the quantum theory
into this structure, carried out by Flesia and Piron, is reviewed. We show how
the density matrix for an effectively pure state can evolve to an effectively
mixed state (decoherence) in this framework. Necessary conditions are given for
the realization of the relation between the spectrum of the generator of the
semigroup and the singularities of the $S$-matrix (in energy representation).
It is shown that these conditions may be met in the Liouville space formulation
of quantum evolution, and in the Hilbert space of relativistic quantum theory.
