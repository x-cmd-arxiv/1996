evolution of Goldstone modes during inflation. If a global symmetry is broken
``before'' inflation, the resulting Goldstone modes are disordered during
inflation in a precise and predictable way. After inflation these Goldstone
modes order themselves in a self-similar way, much as Goldstone modes in field
ordering scenarios based on the Kibble mechanism. For $(H_{inf}^2/M_{pl}^2)\sim
10^{-6},$ through their gravitational interaction these Goldstone modes
generate density perturbations of approximately the right magnitude to explain
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy and seed the structure seen in
the universe today. We point out that for the pattern of symmetry breaking in
which a global $U(1)$ is completely broken, the inflationary evolution of the
Goldstone field may be treated as that of a massless scalar field. Unlike the
more commonly discussed case in which a global $U(1)$ is completely broken in a
cosmological phase transition, in the inflationary case the production of
defects can be made exponentially small, so that Goldstone field evolution is
completely linear. In such a model non-Gaussian perturbations result because to
lowest order density perturbations are sourced by products of Gaussian fields.
Consequently, in this non-Gaussian model N-point correlations may be calculated
by evaluating Feynman diagrams. We explore the issue of phase dispersion and
conclude that this non-Gaussian model predicts Doppler peaks in the CMB
anisotropy.

intrinsic scatter as a function of time and metallicity. The standard approach
to chemical evolution does not attempt to address this scatter in abundances
since only the mean evolution is followed. In this work the scatter is
addressed via a stochastic approach to solving chemical evolution models. Three
standard chemical evolution scenarios are studied using this stochastic
approach; a closed box model, an infall model, and an outflow model. These
models are solved for the solar neighborhood in a Monte Carlo fashion. The
evolutionary history of one particular region is determined randomly based on
the star formation rate and the initial mass function. Following the evolution
in an ensemble of such regions leads to the predicted spread in abundances
expected, based solely on different evolutionary histories of otherwise
identical regions. In this work 13 isotopes are followed including the light
elements, the CNO elements, a few $\alpha$-elements, and iron. It is found that
the predicted spread in abundances for a $10^5\Msun$ region is in good
agreement with observations for the $\alpha$-elements. For CN the agreement is
not as good perhaps indicating the need for more physics input for low mass
stellar evolution. Similarly for the light elements the predicted scatter is
quite small which is in contradiction to the observations of \He{3} in \hii\
regions. The models are tuned for the solar neighborhood so good agreement with
\hii\ regions is not expected. This has important implications for low mass
stellar evolution and on using chemical evolution to determine the primordial
light element abundances in order to test big-bang nucleosynthesis.

density profile in good agreement with current estimates for the distribution
of halo field stars. The observed core in the present-day distribution of halo
clusters results from the rapid evaporation of clusters in the inner regions of
the Galaxy. The initial halo population is also predicted to have a radially
biased orbit distribution in rough agreement with the observed kinematics of
halo field stars. The isotropy of the present-day halo cluster distribution
results from the evaporation of clusters on elongated orbits. Similarly, the
initial disk component has a nearly isotropic initial distribution that becomes
more tangentially biased with time. However, the inferred initial
characteristics of the disk component do not match the kinematics of the
rapidly rotating thin or thick disk stellar populations. These characteristics
may be more indicative of the flattened halo component discussed by Zinn
(1993).
  Detailed examination of cluster evolution confirms the importance of disk
heating. Clusters on low-inclination orbits experience the strongest disk
heating because of optimal matches in resonant frequencies. Disk heating on
high-inclination orbits is weaker but still dominates over spheroidal heating.

to investigate the nature of galaxies producing metal line absorption systems
in the spectrum of the QSO. Along a single line of sight, we find at least 6
metal line absorption systems (of which 3 are newly discovered) ranging in
redshift from 0.317 to 0.892. Through an extensive program of optical and IR
imaging, QSO spectroscopy, and faint galaxy spectroscopy, we have identified 5
of the 6 metal line absorption systems with luminous (L_K > 0.1 L*_K) galaxies.
These have morphologies ranging from very late-type spiral to S0, and exhibit a
wide range of inclination and position angles with respect to the QSO
sightline. The only unidentified absorber, despite our intensive search, is a
damped Lyman $\alpha$ system at $z_{abs}=0.656$. Analysis of the absorption
spectrum suggests that the metal abundances ([Fe/H]$=-1.2$) in this system are
similar to those in damped systems at $z \sim 2$, and to the two other damped
systems for which abundances have been determined at $z <1$. We have found no
examples of intrinsically faint galaxies ($L < 0.1 L^{\ast}$) at small impact
parameters that might have been missed as absorber candidates in our previous
ground-based imaging and spectroscopic programs on MgII absorbing galaxies.

dim that light if the galaxies contain enough dust. Extinction by dust in

one signature of dust, namely reddening, by examining optical-infrared colors
of gravitationally lensed images of quasars. We find that the lensed systems
identified in radio and infrared searches have redder optical-IR colors than
optically selected ones. This could be due to a bias against selecting reddened
(hence extincted) quasars in the optical surveys, or due to the differences in
the intrinsic colors of optical and radio quasars. Comparison of the
radio-selected lensed and unlensed quasars shows that the lensed ones have
redder colors. We therefore conclude that at least part of the color difference
between the two lens samples is due to dust.
  From the color difference between lensed and unlensed radio quasars (and
assuming Galactic extinction law) we can reconcile a large cosmological
constant ($\Lambda=0.9$) with the number of lensed systems observed in flux
limited optical surveys. These results substantially weaken the strongest
constraint on cosmological scenarios that invoke a non-zero cosmological
constant to explain age discrepancy problems, satisfy predictions of
inflationary models of the early universe and play a role in large scale
structure formation models. They also raise the prospect of using gravitational

quantitative structural parameters derived from this analysis, such as the
profiles of luminosity, ellipticity and deviations from ellipticity of the
galaxy. The structural and traditional methods are compared on a complete

certain large dissipative systems to drive themselves into a critical state

various large-scale structures which may appear in this system. The origin of
the critical behavior is explained, critical exponents are introduced, and
scaling relations between the exponents are derived. Results of computer
simulations and analytical calculations are summarized. The existence of an
upper critical dimension and the universality of the critical behavior under
changes of lattice symmetry or the introduction of immunity are discussed. A
survey of interesting modifications of the forest-fire model is given. Finally,
several other important SOC models are briefly described.

involving combinations of the mass differences of two particle mixtures. We
explain how an intermediate measurement may play the role of a regenerator, so
that in principle regeneration-like effects can be induced for the B0 and D0

dominant error process in a physical system is often well known, thus inviting
the question: given a specific error model, can more efficient codes be
