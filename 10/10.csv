been improved significantly in recent years. Because the grids can be place
arbitrarily in space, unstructured meshes can provide much higher spatial
resolution than regular meshes. The built-in nature of mesh adaptivity for
unstructured meshes gives one way to simulate highly dynamic, hierarchical
problems involving both collisionless dark matter and collisional gas dynamics.
In this paper, we describe algorithms to construct unstructured meshes from a
set of points with periodic boundary conditions through Delaunay triangulation,
and algorithms to solve hydrodynamic and N-body problems on an unstructured
mesh . A combination of a local transformation algorithm and the traditional
Bowyer-Watson algorithm gives an efficient approach to perform Delaunay
triangulation. A novel algorithm to solve N-body equations of motion on an
unstructured mesh is described. Poisson's equation is solved using the
conjugate gradient method. A gas-kinetic scheme based on the BGK model to solve
Euler equations is used to evolve the hydrodynamic equations. We apply these
algorithms to solve cosmological settings, which involve both dark and baryonic
matter. Various cooling and heating processes for primordial baryonic matter
are included in the code. The numerical results show that the N-body and
hydrodynamic algorithms based on unstructured meshes with mesh refinement are
well-suited for hierarchical structure formation problems.

at several occasions during its ongoing active state. The observed X-ray
intensity changes drastically on a variety of time scales ranging from
sub-seconds to days. In particular, the source exhibits quasi-periodic
brightness sputters with varying duration and repetition time scale. These
episodes occur occasionally, while the more common X-ray intensity variations
are faster with much smaller amplitudes. The spectrum during the brightness
sputters is remarkably different from the spectrum of the mean high state

accretion disk instability. Based on the coincidence in time of two radio
flares following the observed X-ray sputtering episodes we speculate that

lower limit on the isotope ratio of 12C/13C>20. The presence of C2 and CN
absorption is correlated with cold dust (Tdust<300K) and the presence of CH+
with hot dust (Tdust>300K). All objects with the unidentified 21mum emission
feature exhibit C2 and CN absorption, but not all objects with C2 and CN
detections exhibit a 21mum feature. The derived expansion velocity, ranging
from 5 to 44 km/s, is the same as that derived from CO millimeter line
emission. This unambiguously proves that these lines are of circumstellar
origin and are formed in the AGB ejecta (circumstellar shell expelled during
the preceding AGB phase). Furthermore there seems to be a relation between the
C2 molecular column density and the expansion velocity, which is attributed to
the fact that a higher carbon abundance of the dust leads to a more efficient
acceleration of the AGB wind. Using simple assumptions for the location of the
molecular lines and molecular abundances, mass-loss rates have been derived
from the molecular absorption lines and are comparable to those obtained from
CO emission lines and the infrared excess.

by Crotts (1992) that crowded fields can be monitored by searching for changes
in flux of variable objects by subtracting images of the same field, taken in
time sequence, positionally registered, photometrically normalized, then
subtracted from one another (or a sequence average). The present work tackles
the most difficult part of this task, the adjustment of the point spread
function among images in the sequence so that seeing variations play an
insignificant role in determining the residual after subtraction. The
interesting signal following this process consists of positive and negative
point sources due to variable sources. The measurement of changes in flux
determined in this way we dub ""difference image photometry"" (also called ""pixel
lensing"" [Gould 1996]). - The matching of the image point spread function (PSF)
is accomplished by a division of PSFs in Fourier space to produce a convolution
kernel, in a manner explored for other reasons by Phillips & Davis (1995). In
practice, we find the application of this method is difficult in a typical
telescope and wide field imaging camera due to a subtle interplay between the
spatial variation of the PSF associated with the optical design and the
inevitable time variability of the telescope focus. Such effects lead to

constraints on the temperature profile and mass distribution within the cooling

extreme ($k\sim1$) these show evidence for cores in the mass distribution of
size 110--140$ h_{50}^{-1}$kpc and have temperatures which decline towards the

metallicity of Population II stars, whilst some baryonic DM formation theories
predict that they may instead be clumped into globular-cluster configurations
and have close to zero metallicity. I re-analyse the HST data employing the
zero-metallicity VLM star models of Saumon et al. (1994), which predict V-I
colours below the cuts of previous analyses for stars below 0.2 Mo. From the
models I derive new limits on the allowed halo fraction comprising VLM stars
for both the unclustered and clustered cases. In the unclustered regime I find
a 95% confidence upper limit on the allowed halo fraction of 1.4% inferred from
20 HST fields, comparable to limits derived by previous studies for non-zero
metallicity populations. In the cluster scenario I show that clusters of mass M
and radius R can satisfy both HST and the recent MACHO gravitational
microlensing results, which indicate a lens halo fraction of 40% for a standard
halo model, provided R < 1.2 (M/10^4 Mo)^0.74 pc. However, existing dynamical
limits restrict the allowed range to a tiny region characterised by M \sim
4x10^4 Mo and R \sim 3 pc. Furthermore, consistency between MACHO and HST
demands a present-day clustering efficiency of 92% or better. Intriguingly
however, the cluster mass implied by these limits is theoretically well
motivated and the VLM star scenario may also help to provide an explanation for
the faint red `halo' light recently reported around another galaxy.

portion changes little. The X-ray flux varies on all timescales down to
milliseconds. The power density spectrum (PDS) can be characterized by excess
red noise (``1/f'') at low frequencies and a white noise component that extends
to 1-3 Hz before being cut off. At higher frequencies, the PDS becomes
power-law again, with a slope of roughly -2 (i.e., ``1/f^2''). Broad peaks in
the range of 3-9 Hz are present, and might be due to quasi-periodic
oscillations. The PDS shows interesting spectral dependence: the 1/f component
becomes more prominent when the low-energy spectrum becomes softer. The

spectrum becomes even softer, and the PDS is completely dominated by the 1/f
noise, when the ``true'' soft state is reached. In this paper, subsequent RXTE
observations of Cyg X-1 in the soft state are examined, and the results confirm
our earlier conclusions. Furthermore, we show the results from observations

again, and accordingly, the 1/f noise becomes less dominant, similar to the

immersions into quaternions or imaginary quaternions take the place of chart
maps for a Riemann surface. Starting from a reference immersion we construct
all conformal immersions of a given (simply connected) Riemann surface (up to
translational periods) by spin transformations. With this viewpoint in mind we
discuss how to construct all Bonnet pairs on a simply connected domain from
isothermic surfaces and vice versa. Isothermic surfaces are solutions to a
certain soliton equation and thus a simple dimension count tells us that we
obtain Bonnet pairs which are not part of any of the classical Bonnet families.
The corresponcence between Bonnet pairs and isothermic surfaces is explicit and
to each isothermic surface we obtain a 4-parameter family of Bonnet pairs.

coupling g' is defined with the aim of making the higher order coefficients of
the perturbative series in g' as small as possible.
  In this paper an alternative scenario is discussed where lattice artifacts
are proposed as the cause of the disagreement between Monte Carlo data and the
g_0-perturbative series. We find that with the addition of a lattice artifact
term, the usual asymptotic scaling expression in g_0 is in excellent agreement
with Monte Carlo data. Lattice data studied includes the string tension, the
hadronic scale r_0, the discrete beta function, M_rho, f_pi and the 1P-1S
