background (XRB) by altering the observed density and flux distribution of
background X-ray sources. At faint detection flux thresholds, the resolved
X-ray sources appear brighter and diluted, while the unresolved component of
the XRB appears dimmer and more anisotropic, due to lensing. The diffuse X-ray
intensity in the outer halos of clusters might be lower than the sky-averaged
XRB, after the subtraction of resolved sources. Detection of the lensing signal
with a wide-field X-ray telescope could probe the mass distribution of a
cluster out to its virialization boundary. In particular, we show that the
lensing signature imprinted on the resolved component of the XRB by the cluster
A1689, should be difficult but possible to detect out to 8' at the 2-4 sigma
level, after 10^6 seconds of observation with the forthcoming AXAF satellite.
The lensing signal is fairly insensitive to the lens redshift in the range
0.1<z<0.6. The amplitude of the lensing signal is however sensitive to the
faint end slope of the number-flux relation for unresolved X-ray sources, and
can thus help constrain models of the XRB. A search for X-ray arcs or arclets
could identify the fraction of all faint sources which originate from extended
emission of distant galaxies. The probability for a 3 sigma detection of an
arclet which is stretched by a factor of about 3 after a 10^6 seconds
observation of A1689 with AXAF, is roughly comparable to the fraction of all
background X-ray sources that have an intrinsic size of order 1''.

spatial and projected velocity dispersion profiles are obtained solving the
Jeans equation, and compared to those of the globally isotropic case, already

its logarithmic derivative with respect to the filtering scale

measure the PDF and its low-order moments in scale-free simulations evolved

parameters, n_eff and sigma_eff=sigma, where sigma is the true, nonlinear
variance. With these additional degrees of freedom, results from perturbation
theory provide a good fit of the PDFs, even in the highly nonlinear regime. The
value of n_eff is of course equal to n_linear when sigma << 1, and it decreases
with increasing sigma. A nearly flat plateau is reached when sigma >> 1. In
this regime, the difference between n_eff and n_linear increases when n_linear
decreases. For initial power-spectra with n_linear=-2,-1,0,+1, we find n_eff ~

Lorentzian, but rather exhibit varying amounts of asymmetry about their
respective peaks. We analyze p-mode line asymmetry using both a simplified
one-dimensional model and a more realistic solar model. We find that the amount
of asymmetry exhibited by a given mode depends on the location of the sources
exciting the mode, the mode frequency, and weakly on the mode spherical
harmonic degree, but not on the particular mechanism or location of the
damping. We calculate the dependence of line asymmetry on source location for
solar p-modes, and provide physical explanations of our results in terms of the
simplified model. A comparison of our results to the observations of line
asymmetry in velocity spectra reported by Duvall et al. (1993) for modes of
frequency $\sim$ 2.3 mHz suggests that the sources for these modes are located
more than 325 km beneath the photosphere. This source depth is greater than
that found by Kumar (1994) for acoustic waves of frequency $\sim$ 6 mHz. The
difference may indicate that waves of different frequencies are excited at
different depths in the convection zone. We find that line asymmetry causes the
frequency obtained from a Lorentzian fit to a peak in the power spectrum to
differ from the corresponding eigenfrequency by an amount proportional to a
dimensionless asymmetry parameter and to the mode linewidth.

their low cost, ease of production, and operation at room temperature and 1 atm
makes them ideal for Cold Dark Matter (CDM) searches. SDD's are optimal for the
exploration of the spin-dependent neutralino coupling due to their high

spacetime are given. The solutions are those of the null geodesics of General
Relativity appended by a null string constraint in which the ""constants of
motion"" depend on the world-sheet spatial coordinate. Because of the extended
nature of a string, the physical interpretation of the solutions is completely
different from the point particle case. In particular, a null string is
generally not propagating in a plane through the origin, although each of its
individual points is. Some special solutions are obtained and their physical
interpretation is given. Especially, the solution for a null string with a
constant radial coordinate $r$ moving vertically from the south pole to the
north pole around the photon sphere, is presented. A general discussion of
classical null/tensile strings as compared to massless/massive particles is
given. For instance, tensile circular solutions with a constant radial
coordinate $r$ do not exist at all. The results are discussed in relation to
the previous literature on the subject.

interpreted as theories of composite gauge bosons. It is argued that when
hidden local symmetry is introduced, masslessness and coupling universality of
dynamically generated gauge boson are ensured. To illustrate these ideas we
take a four dimensional Grassmannian sigma model as an example and show that
the model should be regarded as a cut-off theory and there is a critical
coupling at which the hidden local symmetry is restored. Propagator and vertex
functions of the gauge field are calculated explicitly and existence of the
massless pole is shown. The beta function determined from the $ Z $ factor of
the dynamically generated gauge boson coincides with that of an asymptotic
nonfree elementary gauge theory. Using these theoretical machinery we construct
a model in which asymptotic free and nonfree gauge bosons coexist and their
running couplings are related by the reciprocally proportional relation.

"math/9610220",,"Boju Jiang, Shicheng Wang, Ying-Qing Wu","Homeomorphisms of 3-manifolds and the realization of Nielsen Number",,,,"MSRI 1996-074","math.GT",,"  The Nielsen Conjecture for Homeomorphisms asserts that any homeomorphism $f$
of a closed manifold is isotopic to a map realizing the Nielsen number of $f$,
which is a lower bound for the number of fixed points among all maps homotopic
to $f$. The main theorem of this paper proves this conjecture for all
orientation preserving maps on geometric or Haken 3-manifolds. It will also be
shown that on many manifolds all maps are isotopic to fixed point free maps.
  The proof is based on the understanding of homeomorphisms on 2-orbifolds and
3-manifolds. Thurston's classification of surface homeomorphisms will be
generalized to 2-dimensional orbifolds, which is used to study fiber preserving
maps of Seifert fiber spaces. Maps on most Seifert fiber spaces are indeed
isotopic to fiber preserving maps, with the exception of four manifolds and
orientation reversing maps on lens spaces or $S^3$. It will also be determined
exactly which manifolds have a unique Seifert fibration up to isotopy. These
informations will be used to deform a map to certain standard map on each piece
of the JSJ decomposition, as well as on the neighborhood of the decomposition
tori, which will make it possible to shrink each fixed point class to a single
point, and remove inessential fixed point classes.

  model","45 pages, Latex, psfig, submitted to J. Phys. Oceanogr",,,"KNMI/VO-96-02","physics.ao-ph",,"  The mechanism that causes an interdecadal oscillation in a coarse resolution
sector ocean model forced by mixed boundary conditions is studied. The
oscillation is characterized by large fluctuations in convective activity and
air/sea heat exchange on a decadal time scale. When the convective activity is
large, a strengthening of the southeastward surface flow advects more
relatively fresh water from the northwestern part of the basin into the
convective area, which reduces the convective activity. Similarly, when the
convective activity is small, the flow of relatively fresh water is weak, which
enables the expansion of the convective area. The oscillation critically
depends on how the ocean circulation, and especially the surface circulation,
responds to anomalous convective activity. Horizontal boundaries turn out to
play an important role in the dynamical response of the ocean circulation. That
the dynamical reponse is essential to the oscillation is confirmed with two
simple (conceptual) models, and some idealized ocean experiments.

lower mantle, CaSiO_3 perovskite. The commonly assumed cubic structure (Pm3m)
is found to be dynamically unstable at all pressures, exhibiting unstable modes
along the Brillouin zone edge from the M-point to the R-point. Based on these
results, we predict that the ground state structure of CaSiO_3 perovskite is a
distorted phase with lower than cubic symmetry. We predict that a phase
transition occurs in CaSiO_3 perovskite within the earth's lower mantle from
the low temperature distorted phase to the cubic phase at high temperature. The
predicted phase transition provides a possible explanation of some of the
seismological observations of reflective features within the lower mantle.
