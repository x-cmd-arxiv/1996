  compactification included AMSLaTeX v 1.1",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus 0. Let $\FF$ be the variety of
complete flags in an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$. Given an $(n-1)$-tuple
$\alpha$ of positive integers one can consider the space $\MM\alpha$ of
algebraic maps of degree $\alpha$ from $C$ to $\FF$. This space has drawn much
attention recently in connection with Quantum Cohomology. The space $\MM\alpha$
is smooth but not compact. The problem of compactification of $\MM\alpha$
proved very important. One compactification $\MML\alpha$ (the space of {\em
quasiflags}), was constructed in \cite{L}. However, historically the first and
most economical compactification $\MMD\alpha$ (the space of {\em quasimaps})
was constructed by Drinfeld (early 80-s, unpublished). The latter
compactification is singular, while the former one is smooth. Drinfeld has
conjectured that the natural map $\pi:\MML\alpha\to\MMD\alpha$ is a small
resolution of singularities. In the present note we prove this conjecture. As a
byproduct, we compute the stalks of $IC$ sheaf on $\MMD\alpha$ and, moreover,
the Hodge structure in these stalks. Namely, the Hodge structure is a pure Tate
one, and the generating function for the $IC$ stalks is just the Lusztig's
$q$-analogue of Kostant's partition function (see \cite{Lu}).

  submitted. Also available at http://ensor.mit.edu/~rasio",,"10.1086/303916",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a general method for determining the masses and orbital parameters
of binary millisecond pulsars with long orbital periods (P_orb >> 1 yr), using
timing data in the form of pulse frequency derivatives. We apply our method to
analyze the properties of the second companion in the PSR B1620-26 triple
system. We use the latest timing data for this system to constrain the mass and
orbital parameters of the second companion. We find that all possible solutions
have a mass m_2 in the range 2.4 10^-4 M_sun <= m_2 sin i_2 <= 1.2 10^-2 M_sun,
i.e., almost certainly excluding a second companion of stellar mass and
suggesting instead that the system contains a planet or a brown dwarf. Using
Monte-Carlo realizations of the triple configuration in three dimensions we
find the most probable value of m_2 to be 0.010(5) M_sun, corresponding to a
distance of 38(6) AU from the center of mass of the inner binary (the errors
indicate 80% confidence intervals). We also apply our method to analyze the
planetary system around PSR B1257+12, where a distant, giant planet may be
present in addition to the three well-established Earth-mass planets. We find
that the simplest interpretation of the frequency derivatives implies the
presence of a fourth planet with a mass of ~100 M_earth in a circular orbit of
radius ~40 AU.

We find evidence for strong evolution of IRAS galaxies, in luminosity prop. to
(1+z)^3.2 or density prop. to (1+z)^6.0 for f60 > 150 mJy, in agreement with
previous claims. An excess of rather red faint optical counterparts with B>18,
consistent with the above evolution, is detected. We interpret these results as
strong evolution at recent times among the starburst (or dusty AGN) population
of merging/interacting galaxies. Most of these objects at moderate redshifts
may pass unnoticed among the population of massive spirals in broad-band
optical surveys, because of large amounts of dust extinction in their central
regions. A possible link with the strong evolution observed in the optical for
blue sub-M* galaxies is discussed.

of polyhedra and manifolds comming from the theory of von Neumann algebras.
First, we examine generality in which one may apply the construction of the
extended abelian category, which was suggested in the previous publications of
the author, using the ideas of P.Freyd. This leads to the notions of a finite
von Neumann category and of a trace on such category. Given a finite von
Neumann category, we study the extended homology and cohomology theories with
values in the abelian extension. Any trace on the initial category produces
numerical invariants - the von Neumann dimension and the Novikov - Shubin
numbers. Thus, we obtain the local versions of the Novikov - Shubin invariants,
localized at different traces. In the ""abelian"" case this localization can be
made more geometric: we show that any torsion object determines a ""divisor"" --
a closed subspace of the space of the parameters. The divisors of torsion
objects together with the information produced by the local Novikov - Shubin
invariants may be used to study multiplicities of intersections of algebraic
and analytic varieties (we discuss here only simple examples demonstrating this
possibility). We compute explicitly the divisors and the von Neumann dimensions
of the extended cohomology in the real analytic situation. We also give general
formulae for the extended cohomology of a mapping torus. Finally, we show how
one can define a De Rham version of the extended cohomology and prove a De Rham
type theorem.

shape that is traditionally used in OBE models, the Skyrme form factor leaves
low momentum transfers essentially unaffected while it suppresses the
high-momentum region strongly. It turns out that this behavior is very
appropriate for models of the NN interaction and makes possible to use a soft
pion form factor in the NN system. As a consequence, the $\pi N$ and the $NN$
systems can be described using the same soft $\pi NN$ form factor, which is
impossible with the monopole.
