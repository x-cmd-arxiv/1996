information about the galaxy formation phase. From evolutionary models we
establish a link between the present features of late type galaxies and the
protogalactic density fluctuations. This link is used to estimate the
fluctuation power spectrum amplitude at galactic scales. The agreement with the
power spectrum derived from galaxy distribution and extrapolated to galactic
scales, is satisfactory. Meanwhile, the comparison with respect to the standard
cold dark matter power spectrum normalized to COBE satellite meassurements
reveals only a marginal agreement. Among the most interesting results, the
Tully-Fisher relation and the constant central brightness pointed out by
Freeman (1970) appear to be the natural consequences of the initial
cosmological conditions.

temperature is very low and depends weakly on the band filling near half
filling. The number of unpaired electrons remains nearly constant with
temperature at fixed attractive potential strength. In contrast, the static

for $p\bar{p}\to\gamma\omega$ is suppressed due to destructive interference
between the intermediate $\rho$ and $\omega$ states while the interference in

of two parts: the quasiclassical quantisation of the chaotic systems and
attempts to understand the classical chaos in terms of quantum mechanics. The
first question has been partially solved by the Gutzwiller semiclassical trace
formula for the eigenvalues of chaotic systems, while the classical chaos may
be derived from quantum equations only introducing the decoherence process due
to interaction with system's environment or intermediate frequent measurement.
