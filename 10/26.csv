also elliptical galaxy Dn-sigma samples originally presented elsewhere. The
relative zeropointing of the elliptical and spiral data sets is discussed here.
  The basic elements of the Mark III Catalog are the observables for each
object (redshift, magnitude, velocity width, etc.) and inferred distances
derived from the TF or Dn-sigma relations. Malmquist bias-corrected distances
are computed for each catalog object using density fields obtained from the
IRAS 1.2 Jy redshift survey. Distances for both individual objects and groups
are provided. A variety of auxiliary data, including distances and local
densities predicted from the IRAS redshift survey reconstruction method, are
tabulated as well. We study the distributions of TF residuals for three of our
samples and conclude that they are well-approximated as Gaussian. For the
Mathewson et al. sample we demonstrate a significant decrease in TF scatter
with increasing velocity width. We test for, but find no evidence of, a
correlation between TF residuals and galaxy morphology.

Latter could have a simple elliptical mass distribution with ellipticity and

density profile ($\rho$ $\sim$ $r^{-1.56\pm0.1}$ with $r_{c}$ $\le$
22.5$h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc) within 150$h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc implies increasing M/L ratio
with the radius, and could be in agreement with predictions from standard CDM
simulations. At least two faint sources (unlensed magnitude, R=23.9 and 26,
respectively) are aligned with the cluster core and are responsible of the arc
systems. They have been reconstructed with details as small as 0"".02 (or
160$h_{50}^{-1}$ pc in the source assumed at z= 1), one could be a nearly
edge-on barred spiral galaxy, and the other has a more complex morphology,
which could be related to a close interacting pair and/or to dust. They show
strong signs of star formation indicated by compact HII regions well off their
center. The observation of giant luminous arcs by HST could even resolve the
size of giant HII regions at z$\sim$ 1.

include matter-enhanced (MSW) resonant neutrino flavor conversion effects where
appropriate. We point out that for plausible ranges of neutrino magnetic
moments and proto-neutron star magnetic fields, spin-flavor conversion of
$\nu_\tau$ (or $\nu_\mu$) with a cosmologically significant mass (1--100 eV)
into a light $\bar \nu_e$ could lead to an enhanced neutron excess in

$r$-process nucleosynthesis associated with late-time neutrino-heated ejecta
from supernovae. Similar spin-flavor conversion of neutrinos at earlier epochs
could lead to an increased shock reheating rate and, concomitantly, a larger
supernova explosion energy. We show, however, that such increased neutrino
heating likely will be accompanied by an enhanced neutron excess which could
exacerbate the problem of the overproduction of the neutron number $N = 50$
nuclei in the supernova ejecta from this stage. In all of these scenarios, the
average $\bar\nu_e$ energy will be increased over those predicted by supernova
models with no neutrino mixings. This may allow the SN1987a data to constrain
RSFP-based schemes.

tracers of recent massive star formation and death. Up-to-date catalogs of OB
associations, SNRs, young pulsars, HII regions and young open clusters were
used in finding counterparts for a recent list of EGRET sources. It has been
argued for some time that EGRET source positions are correlated with SNRs and
OB associations as a class; we extend such analyses by finding additional
counterparts and assessing the probability of individual source
identifications. Among the several scenarios relating EGRET sources to massive
stars, we focus on young neutron stars as the origin of the gamma-ray emission.
The characteristics of the candidate identifications are compared to the known
gamma-ray pulsar sample and to detailed Galactic population syntheses using our
outer gap pulsar model of gamma-ray emission. Both the spatial distribution and
luminosity function of the candidates are in good agreement with the model
predictions; we infer that young pulsars can account for the bulk of the excess
low latitude EGRET sources. We show that with this identification, the
gamma-ray point sources provide an important new window into the history of

GRO J1655-40 in complete quiescence. In contrast to the 1995 photometry, the
light curves from 1996 are almost completely dominated by ellipsoidal
modulations from the secondary star. Model fits to the light curves, which take
into account the temperature profile of the accretion disk and eclipse effects,
yield an inclination of i=69.50 +/- 0.08 degrees and a mass ratio of Q=2.99 +/-
0.08. The precision of our determinations of i and Q allow us to determine the
black hole mass to an accuracy of approximately 4% (7.02 +/- 0.22 solar
masses). The secondary star's mass is 2.34 +/- 0.12 solar masses. The position
of the secondary on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is consistent with that of
a 2.3 solar mass star which has evolved off the main sequence and is halfway to
the start of the giant branch. Using the new spectra we present an improved
value of the spectroscopic period (2.62157 +/- 0.00015 days), radial velocity
semiamplitude (228.2 +/- 2.2 km/sec), and mass function (3.24 +/- 0.09 solar

system of 3.4E-9 solar masses per year (2.16E+17 grams per second), which is
much larger than the average mass transfer rates implied in the other six
transient black hole systems, but still barely below the critical mass transfer

  changed. Some minor mistakes in reference are corrected",,,,"gr-qc chao-dyn nlin.CD",,"  We examine the effect of local matter on the chaotic behavior of a
relativistic test particle in non-vacuum static axisymmetric spacetimes. We
find that the sign of the sectional curvature in the geodesic deviation
equation defined by the Riemann curvature does not always become a good tool to
judge the occurrence of chaos in the non-vacuum case. However, we show that the
locally unstable region ( LU region ) defined by the Weyl curvature can provide
information about chaos even in non-vacuum spacetime as well as in vacuum
spacetime. Since the Weyl tensor affects only the shear part of the geodesic
congruence, it works effectively to stretch some directions of geodesic
congruence, which helps to cause the chaotic behavior of geodesics. Actually,
the orbit moving around an unstable periodic orbit (UPO) becomes strongly
chaotic if it passes through an LU region, which means that the LU region can
be used as a good tool to know in which situation the chaos by homoclinic
mixing occurs around a UPO.

  The interactions are described by an effective SU(3)_L X SU(3)_R chiral
lagrangian where terms of higher order in density, baryon momentum, and kaon
mass are suppressed by powers of the symmetry breaking scale, Lambda. We take
up to next to leading order terms (n = 2,3,4). We search for infinite baryon
number solutions, namely ``strange baryonic matter'', using a Thomas-Fermi
approximation for a slowly varying condensate and a lowest order Hartree
approximation to describe the many body interactions. For simplicity we study a
pure K^0 condensate and only neutrons, the lightest baryons in that condensate.
We find solutions with neutron number densities, rho_n > 3.5 rho_0, where rho_0
is the infinite nuclear matter density. This is consistent with the estimate of
the onset of a K-condensate at rho_n = 2-4 rho_0. We show that the binding
energies, E_b, grow with rho_n and for rho_n < 7 rho_0 (at rho_n > 7 rho_0
perturbative expansion is lost) we find E_b < 150 MeV (E_b < 70 MeV for rho_n <
5 rho_0) even in the most favorable cases. These binding energies may be too
low for this type of matter to appear and persist in the early universe.
