during the about 4hr Rosat pointing. The source X-ray spectrum is extremely
soft, with an unabsorbed 0.1-2keV luminosity of a few times 10^32 erg s^-1

results imply that the unseen companion is an accreting degenerate star, a
white dwarf or, more likely, a neutron star. In either case HD49798 corresponds
to a previously unobserved evolutionary stage of a massive binary system, after

means that only those components of the wavepacket whose wavenumber belong to
allowed subminibands of the fractal-like energy spectrum can propagate over the
entire superlattice. The Fourier pattern of the transmitted part of the
wavepacket presents clear evidences of fractality reproducing those of the
underlying energy spectrum. This phenomenon persists even in the presence of
unintentional disorder due to growth imperfections. Finally, we have
demonstrated that periodic coherent-field induced oscillations (Bloch

from the beginning of the calculation by projecting into symmetry invariant
subspaces. The details of this group theoretical treatment are presented with
special attention to the nongeneric case of L=4, where a particular complicated
space group appears. For all the lattices studied, a significant amount of
levels within each symmetry invariant subspaces remains degenerated, but except
for L=4 the ground state is nondegenerate. We explain the remaining

flux of electron neutrinos detected comes from electron capture in $^7{Be}$.
These solutions arise from neutrino oscillations in which $\nu_e$ $-$
$\nu_\tau$ mixing suppresses high energy $\nu_e$ and $\nu_e - \nu_\mu$ mixing
suppresses low energy $\nu_e$ as qualitatively suggested from some SO(10) grand
unified models. The importance of future observations is emphasized.

kinematics from interior quark dynamics, we study their interplay when a quark
state occurs near a hadronic threshold. Characteristic parameters, such as the
observed peak width, the decay width, and the shape of a cross-section itself
are highly affected by the threshold. A general pole-form expression for the
S-matrix in an arbitrary background is given, and the pole structure of S is
examined. We show that at a hadronic threshold two poles in S are generally
important. We also classify the S-matrix pole structure considering an example
where nonsingular coupled channels are closed at the threshold. The framework
of our paper is the P-matrix formalism, which is reviewed and extended for use
together with conventional methods of computing quark-gluon dynamics. Results
and applications are illustrated for the doubly strange two-baryon system, the
detailed analysis of which we postpone till our forthcoming paper.

down from an initial temperature T_i > T_c to below T_c with the initial value
of the zero mode of the inflaton phi(0) << m lambda^{-1/4}, the dynamics is
determined by the growth of long-wavelength quantum fluctuations. For phi(0) >>
m lambda^{-1/4} the dynamics is determined by the evolution of the classical
zero mode. In the regime where spinodal quantum fluctuations give the most
important contribution to the non-equilibrium dynamics, we find that they
modify the equation of state providing a graceful exit from the inflationary
stage. Inflation ends through this new mechanism at a time scale t_s >=
[H/m^2]ln[lambda^{-1}] which for H >= m and very weak coupling allows over one
hundred e-folds during the de Sitter phase. Spatially correlated domains grow
to be of horizon-size and quantum fluctuations ``freeze-out'' for times t> t_s.

that the net baryon number density is proportional to $\th_i^3$, where $\th_i$

Montecarlo simulations. We first review the general set-up of finite
temperature lattice gauge theories, using asymmetric lattices, and develop a
consistent perturbative expansion in the coupling $\beta_s$ of the space-like
plaquettes. We study in detail the effective models for the Polyakov loop
obtained, in the zeroth order approximation in $\beta_s$, both from the Wilson
action (symmetric lattice) and from the heat kernel action (completely
asymmetric lattice). The distinctive feature of the heat kernel model is its
relation with two-dimensional QCD on a cylinder; the Wilson model, on the other
hand, can be exactly reduced to a twisted one-plaquette model via a procedure
of the Eguchi-Kawai type. In the weak coupling regime both models can be
related to exactly solvable Kazakov-Migdal matrix models. The instability of
the weak coupling solution is due in both cases to a condensation of
instantons; in the heat kernel case, it is directly related to the
Douglas-Kazakov transition of QCD2. A detailed analysis of these results
provides rather accurate predictions of the deconfinement temperature. In spite
of the zeroth order approximation they are in good agreement with the
Montecarlo simulations in 2+1 dimensions, while in 3+1 dimensions they only
agree with the Montecarlo results away from the continuum limit.

problem to N coupled algebraic transcendental equations. We observe that when
the Fermi momentum approaches the resonance momentum, the one-particle
distribution function increases near the Fermi surface. When the Fermi momentum
is increased beyond the resonance momentum, the equation of state becomes
softer. The observed behavior can be interpreted in terms of formation of a
Bose-Einstein condensate of two-fermion resonances (dibaryons). In cold nuclear
matter, it should occur if 2(m_N + epsilon_F) is greater or equal to m_D, where
