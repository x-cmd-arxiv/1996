detecting a stochastic gravitational background generated in the very early
universe. In this article, we review the various cosmological processes which
can lead to such a background, including quantum fluctuations during inflation,
bubble collisions in a first-order phase transition and the decay of a network
of cosmic strings. We conclude that signals from strongly first-order phase
transitions, possibily at the end of inflation, and networks fo local cosmic
strings are within the sensitivity of proposed detectors. However, backgrouds
from slow-roll inflation and the electroweak phase transition are too weak.

magnitude in the two fields. By combining these counts with similar
observations from a large area field survey we subtract the field contamination
statistically to produce luminosity functions for the two clusters. Great care
has been taken to achieve agreement between the photometry of these two
samples. The cluster data are complete to a limiting magnitude of I=22.5 or an
absolute magnitude in the cluster of I= -18.0 ($M^\star+5$). The luminosity
functions of both clusters are well described by a Gaussian function for the
bright galaxies, combined with a Schechter function at the faint end, similar
to that required to fit the luminosity function in local clusters. The slope at
the faint end of the Schechter function in both clusters is extremely steep in
V, alpha ~ -2. A shallower slope is seen to the limit of the I data, indicating
that the cluster population is rapidly blueing as we reach fainter. The
excellent agreement between the form of the luminosity function in our two
distant clusters, as well as agreement with the luminosity function given by
Driver et al (1994) for a single z=0.21 cluster, indicates that this faint blue
population is a general constituent of distant clusters. We compare our results
with those from studies of local clusters. Depending upon the degree of fading
(or disruption) of these faint blue galaxies,we tentatively identify their
remnants with the low surface brightness dwarf galaxies which are the dominant
population in local clusters. We discuss the possible role of this population

magnetic fields within a certain range of wavelengths. We discuss how these

entropy gradients, convection starts near the neutrinosphere about 20-30 ms

one second the whole protoneutron star is convective. The deleptonization of
the star proceeds much faster than in the corresponding spherically symmetrical
model because the lepton flux and the neutrino luminosities increase by up to a
factor of two. The convection below the neutrinosphere raises the
neutrinospheric temperatures and mean energies of the emitted neutrinos by
10-20%. This can have important implications for the supernova explosion
mechanism and changes the detectable neutrino signal from the Kelvin-Helmholtz
cooling of the protoneutron star. In particular, the enhanced electron neutrino
flux relative to the electron antineutrino flux during the early post-bounce

consisting of a power law plus cold, uniform absorption gives acceptable fits
to the spectra of all sources. The ASCA spectra of the 6 brightest objects show
evidence for absorption in excess of the Galactic value at a << 99% confidence
level. Comparison with the ROSAT data suggests that absorption has
significantly varied ($\Delta N_{H} \sim 8$ $\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$) in
the case of S5 0836+71, on a time-scale of $\sim$ 0.8 yr in the quasar frame.
For the remaining 5 sources for which ROSAT spectra were available, the two
instruments gave consistent results and the data were combined yielding
unprecedent spectral coverage (typically $\sim$ 0.4-40 keV in the quasar frame)
for high-z quasars. This allows to put severe limits on several different
descriptions of the continuum (e.g. broken power law, bremsstrahlung,
reflection component). No Fe K$\alpha$ emission line is detected in any of the
ASCA spectra. An absorption edge consistent with Fe K$\alpha$ at the quasar
redshift is marginally detected in S5 0014+81. Possible origins for the

the molecular clouds and dust present in our Galaxy (usually disregarded) are
carefully considered. In the light of the new results for S5 0836+71 and S5

results of $256^3$ particle N-body simulations of the clustering evolution of
dark matter in four cold dark matter models with different cosmological
parameters. The high resolution and large volume of these simulations allows us
to determine reliably the mass autocorrelation function for pair separations in
the range $40\hkpc$ to $20\hmpc$. Comparison of these with the observed galaxy
correlation function shows that for any of these models to be viable, the
distribution of galaxies must be biased relative to the distribution of mass in
a non-trivial, scale-dependent fashion. In particular, low $\Omega_0$ models
require the galaxies to be more ``weakly'' clustered than the mass at small and
intermediate pair separations. Simulations which include the evolution of gas
show that cold gas knots form with approximately the abundance expected on
theoretical grounds, although a few excessively massive objects grow near the
centres of rich clusters. The locations where these cold gas knots form are, in
general, biased relative to the distribution of mass in a scale-dependent way.
Some of these biases have the required sign but they are, for the most part,
weaker than is necessary for agreement with observations. The antibias present
in our low $\Omega_0$ N-body/SPH simulation appears to be related to the
merging and disruption of galaxies in rich clusters.

reviewed. They show that convective instabilities in the collapsed stellar core
might play an important role already during the first second after the
formation of the supernova shock. Convectively unstable situations occur below
and near the neutrinosphere as well as in the neutrino-heated region between
the nascent neutron star and the supernova shock after the latter has stalled
at a radius of typically 100-200 km.
  While convective overturn in the layer of neutrino energy deposition clearly
helps the explosion to develop and potentially provides an explanation of
strong mantle and envelope mixing, asphericities, and non-uniform 56Ni
distribution observed in supernova SN 1987A, its presence and importance
depends on the strength of the neutrino heating and thus on the size of the
neutrino fluxes from the neutron star. Convection in the hot-bubble region can
only develop if the growth timescale of the instabilities and the heating
timescale are both shorter than the accretion timescale of the matter advected
through the stagnant shock. For too small neutrino luminosities this
requirement is not fulfilled and convective activity cannot develop, leading to
very weak explosions or even fizzling models, just as in the one-dimensional
situation.
  Convectively enhanced neutrino luminosities from the protoneutron star can
therefore provide an essential condition for the explosion of the star. Very
recent two-dimensional, self-consistent, general relativistic simulations of
the cooling of a newly-formed neutron star demonstrate and confirm the
possibility that Ledoux convection, driven by negative lepton number and

radiation from binary systems in which each STF mass and current moment of
order l is given by the lowest-order, Newtonian-like l-pole moment of the
orbiting masses; we neglect post-Newtonian corrections to each STF moment.
Specializing to orbits which are circular (apart from the radiation-induced
inspiral), we find an explicit infinite series for the energy flux in powers of
$v/c$, where v is the orbital velocity. We show that the series converges for
all values $v/c < 2/e$ when one mass is much smaller than the other, and $v/c <
4/e$ for equal masses,where e is the base of natural logarithms. These values
include all physically relevant values for compact binary inspiral. This
convergence cannot indicate whether or not the full series (obtained from the
exact moments) will converge. But if the full series does not converge, our
analysis shows that this failure to converge does not originate from summing

the Greenbaum criterion as a cost functional for the neural net. The algorithm
is able to learn efficient interpolation operators in the case of the ordered
Laplace equation with only a very small critical slowing down and with a
surprisingly small amount of work comparable to that of a Conjugate Gradient
solver. In the case of the two-dimensional Laplace equation with SU(2) gauge
fields at beta=0 the learning exhibits critical slowing down with an exponent
of about z = 0.4. The algorithm is able to find quite good interpolation
operators in this case as well. Thereby it is proven that a practical true
multigrid algorithm exists even for a gauge theory. An improved algorithm using
dynamical blocks that will hopefully overcome the critical slowing down
completely is sketched.

in models for which kinetic mixing is suppressed or the D-terms are arranged to

calculate the size of kinetic mixing both in field theory and in string theory,

gauge group SU(4), with the preons in the 10 representation; this choice of
gauge gluon and preon multiplets is motivated by the possibility of embedding
them in an N=6 supergravity multiplet. Hypercolor singlets are forbidden in the
fermionic sector of this theory; we propose that SU(4) symmetry spontaneously
breaks to $SU(3) \times U(1)$, with the binding of triality nonzero preons and
gluons into composites, and with the formation of a color singlet condensate
that breaks the initial $Z_{12}$ vacuum symmetry to $Z_{6}$. The spin 1/2
fermionic composites have the triality structure of a quark lepton family, and
the initial $Z_{12}$ symmetry implies that there are six massless families,
which mix to give three distinct families, two massless with massive partners
and one with both states massive, at the scale of the condensate. The spin 1
triality zero composites of the color triplet SU(4) gluons, when coupled to the
condensate and with the color singlet representation of the 10 acting as a
doorway state, lead to weak interactions of the fermionic composites through an
exact SU(2) gauge algebra. The initial $Z_{12}$ symmetry implies that this
SU(2) gauge algebra structure is doubled, which in turn requires that the
corresponding independent gauge bosons must couple to chiral components of the
composite fermions. Since the U(1) couples to the 10 representation as $B-L$,
an effective $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ electroweak theory
arises at the condensate scale, with all composites having the correct electric
charge structure. A renormalization group analysis shows that the conversion by
