depend not only on the number of variables and on the degrees of the input

parameters. It is essentially optimal in the general case, and it substantially
improves the existent bounds in some special cases. The proof of this result is
combinatorial, and it relies on global estimations for the Hilbert function of
homogeneous polynomial ideals. In this direction, we obtain a lower bound for
the Hilbert function of an arbitrary homogeneous polynomial ideal, and an upper
bound for the Hilbert function of a generic hypersurface section of an unmixed

function of spectral type using the Autofib redshift survey, a compendium of
over 1700 galaxy redshifts in various magnitude-limited samples spanning
b_J=11.5-24.0. To carry out this analysis we have developed a cross-correlation
technique which classifies faint galaxy spectra into one of six types based on
local galaxy templates. Tests and simulations show that this technique yields
classifications correct to within one type for more than 90% of the galaxies in
our sample. We have also developed extensions of the step-wise maximum
likelihood method and the STY parametric method for estimating LFs which are
applicable to recovering an evolving LF from multiple samples. We find that:
(i) The spectra and LF of E/S0 galaxies show no appreciable evolution out to at
least z ~ 0.5. (ii) Early-type spirals show modest evolution, characterised by
a gradual steepening of the faint end of their LF with redshift. (iii) Out to z
~ 0.5, the overall evolution of the galaxy population is dominated by changes
seen in late-type spirals. The characteristic luminosity (L^*) of these
galaxies appears to brighten with redshift and there are signs of strong
density evolution (a rapid increase in \phi^*). These effects appear to be
luminosity dependent so that the LF steepens at higher redshift. These trends
are accompanied by a steep increase in the median [OII] equivalent width,
implying a rapid increase in the star-formation rate with redshift at fixed
luminosity---a given star-formation rate is found at higher redshift in
galaxies of higher luminosity. We find that these conclusions are robust with
respect to spectral classification errors and the luminosity function
estimator.

power-spectra and evolution scenarios. The dipole is due to large scale
structure as well as to the observer's motion (the Compton-Getting effect). For
a typical observer the two effects turn out to be comparable in amplitude. The
coupling of the two effects makes it difficult to use the XRB for independent
confirmation of the CMB dipole being due to the observer's motion. The large
scale structure dipole (rms per component) relative to the monopole is in the
range $a_{1m}/a_{00} \sim (0.5-9.0) \times 10^{-3} $. The spread is mainly due
to the assumed redshift evolution scenarios of the X-ray volume emissivity
$\rho_x(z)$. The dipole's prediction is consistent with a measured dipole in
the HEAO1 XRB map. Typically, the harmonic spectrum drops with $l$ like $a_{lm}
\sim l^{-0.4}$. This behaviour allows us to discriminate a true clustering
signal against the flux shot noise, which is constant with $l$, and may
dominate the signal unless bright resolved sources are removed from the XRB
map. We also show that Sachs-Wolfe and Doppler (due to the motion of the
sources) effects in the XRB are negligible. Although our analysis focuses on
the XRB, the formalism is general and can be easily applied to other
cosmological backgrounds.

Because He3 is one of the nuclei produced in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), it
is noted that galactic and stellar evolution uncertainties necessarily relax
constraints based on He3. We incorporate into chemical evolution models which
include outflow, the new yields for He3 of Boothroyd & Malaney (1995) which
predict that low mass stars are net destroyers of He3. Since these yields do
not account for the high \he3/H ratio observed in some planetary nebulae, we
also consider the possibility that some fraction of stars in the 1 - 3 solar
mass range do not destroy their He3 in theirpost main-sequence phase. We also
consider the possibility that the gas expelled by stars in these mass ranges
does not mix with the ISM instantaneously thus delaying the He3 produced in
these stars, according to standard yields, from reaching the ISM. In general,
we find that the Galactic D and He3 abundances can be fit regardless of whether
the primordial D/H value is high (2 x 10^{-4}) or low (2.5 x 10^{-5}).

restricting the summation over all states to a (small) subclass which is chosen
such as to well represent the important states. This procedure generalizes mean
field theory and can be systematically improved by including more states or
fluctuations. We analyze in detail the simplest of these approximations which
corresponds to summing over states with local antiferromagnetic (AF) order. If
in the states considered the AF order changes sufficiently little in space and
time, the path integral becomes a finite dimensional integral for which the
saddle point evaluation is exact. This leads to generalized mean field
equations allowing for the possibility of more than one relevant saddle points.
In a big parameter regime (both in temperature and filling), we find that this
integral has {\em two} relevant saddle points, one corresponding to finite AF
order and the other without. These degenerate saddle points describe a phase of
AF ordered fermions coexisting with free, metallic fermions. We argue that this
mixed phase is a simple mean field description of a variety of possible
inhomogeneous states, appropriate on length scales where these states appear
homogeneous. We sketch systematic refinements of this approximation which can
give more detailed descriptions of the system.

zero-point energy. We define the zero-point ambiguity (ZPA) as the difference
between these two definitions of vacuum energy. Using the zeta function
technique, in order to obtain renormalized quantities, we show that ZPA
vanishes, implying that both of the above definitions of vacuum energy coincide
for a large class of geometries and a very general potential. In addition, we
show explicitly that an extra term, obtained by E. Myers some years ago for the
ZPA, disappears when a scale parameter $\mu$ is consistently introduced in all
zeta functions in order to keep them dimensionless.

multispin quantum gates in which the input and output two-state systems (spins)

quantum XOR gate function for a system of three spins: two input and one
output.
