a vigorous episode of star formation. We show that this sudden loss of mass
leads to the formation of a core in the dark matter density profile, although
the original halo is modeled by a coreless (Hernquist) profile. The core radius
thus created is a sensitive function of the mass and radius of the baryonic
disk being blown up. The loss of a disk with mass and size consistent with
primordial nucleosynthesis constraints and angular momentum considerations
imprints a core radius which is only a small fraction of the original
scale-length of the halo. These small perturbations are, however, enough to
reconcile the rotation curves of dwarf irregulars with the density profiles of

structure of dark matter halos formed through dissipationless hierarchical
clustering. Independent of halo mass, power spectrum, and cosmological
parameters, the density profiles of dark halos can be accurately fit by scaling
a simple two-parameter profile. The two parameters of the fit, which can be
expressed as the mass and characteristic density of each halo, are strongly
correlated. The characteristic density is directly proportional to the mean
density of the universe at the time of assembly of each halo. Low mass halos
have higher characteristic densities, reflecting their higher collapse
redshift. Using this halo structure to fit the rotation curves of a large
sample of disk galaxies, we show that halos formed in the standard cold dark
matter (CDM) scenario are too centrally concentrated to be consistent with the
rotation curves of low-surface brightness galaxies. Less concentrated halos,
such as those formed in a low-density, flat CDM universe ($\Omega_0=0.3$,
$\Lambda=0.7$), are favored by these observations. Our fits also indicate that
the dark halo is important at all radii, and that its total mass is strongly
correlated with the luminosity of the galaxy. This model provides a natural
explanation for the disk-halo conspiracy and for the lack of dependence of the
Tully-Fisher relation on galaxy surface brightness.

``self-force'' on a particle in a curved spacetime is investigated using an
axiomatic approach. In the electromagnetic case, our key postulate is a
``comparison axiom'', which states that whenever two particles of the same
charge $e$ have the same magnitude of acceleration, the difference in their
self-force is given by the ordinary Lorentz force of the difference in their
(suitably compared) electromagnetic fields. We thereby derive an expression for
the electromagnetic self-force which agrees with that of DeWitt and Brehme as
corrected by Hobbs. Despite several important differences, our analysis of the
gravitational self-force proceeds in close parallel with the electromagnetic
case. In the gravitational case, our final expression for the (reduced order)
equations of motion shows that the deviation from geodesic motion arises
entirely from a ``tail term'', in agreement with recent results of Mino et al.
Throughout the paper, we take the view that ``point particles'' do not make
sense as fundamental objects, but that ``point particle equations of motion''
do make sense as means of encoding information about the motion of an extended
body in the limit where not only the size but also the charge and mass of the
body go to zero at a suitable rate. Plausibility arguments for the validity of
our comparison axiom are given by considering the limiting behavior of the
self-force on extended bodies.

  Spectroscopy and Related Topics, Budapest, October 8-12, 1996",,,,"nucl-th",,"  The connection between the neutron halo observed in light neutron rich nuclei
and the neutron radiative capture process is outlined. We show how nuclear
structure information such as spectroscopic factors and external components of
the radial wave function of loosely bound states can be derived from the
neutron capture cross section. The link between the direct radiative capture
and the Coulomb dissociation process is elucidated.

Model, it has been found that a congested flow is generated spontaneously from
a homogeneous flow for a certain range of the traffic density. A
well-established congested flow obtained in a numerical simulation shows a
remarkable repetitive property such that the velocity of a vehicle evolves
exactly in the same way as that of its preceding one except a time delay $T$.
This leads to a global pattern formation in time development of vehicles'
motion, and gives rise to a closed trajectory on $\Delta x$-$v$
(headway-velocity) plane connecting congested and free flow points. To obtain
the closed trajectory analytically, we propose a new approach to the pattern
formation, which makes it possible to reduce the coupled car following
equations to a single difference-differential equation (Rondo equation). To
demonstrate our approach, we employ a class of linear models which are exactly
solvable. We also introduce the concept of ``asymptotic trajectory'' to
determine $T$ and $v_B$ (the backward velocity of the pattern), the global
parameters associated with vehicles' collective motion in a congested flow, in
terms of parameters such as the sensitivity $a$, which appeared in the original
coupled equations.

  Studies in Adv. Math. (1997)",,,"q-alg math.QA",,"  An invariant $\mu_{\alpha}(K)$ of fibred knots $K$ in a homology sphere is
defined for each $\alpha \in {\bold S}{\bold U}_n$ as follows. Since the knot
is fibred, the knot complement is described by an element of the mapping class
group, which induces an action on the variety of ${\bold S}{\bold U}_n$
representations of the surface group. Restricting attention to those
representations with holonomy along the longitude conjugate to $a \in {\bold
S}{\bold U}_n,$ one can define $\mu_{\alpha}(K)$ to be the Lefschetz number of
this action. The dependence of $\mu_\alpha(K)$ on $\alpha$ is studied and
formulas relating $\mu_{\alpha}(K)$ to $\mu_{\beta}(K)$ are derived for
$\alpha,\beta \in
  ${\bold S}{\bold U}_n$.$
