main supernova shock wave, and can be quite energetic. The spectrum of such
fast ejecta is estimated based on recent analytic and numerical supernova
models, and found to be a power law having a cutoff at an energy of order 10
MeV/nucl, the precise value of which depends on the supernova mass and
energetics. With cutoffs in this range there can be significant flux with
energies above the thresholds for $\gamma$-ray and Li, Be, and B production.
These nuclear interactions should inevitably accompany the passage of prompt
supernova ejecta through the surrounding medium. The fast particle composition
is that of the outermost layers of the progenitor; if the progenitor
experienced significant loss of its envelope to a companion or by mass loss,
then the composition is nonsolar, and in particular, metal-rich. Such a
composition and spectrum of fast particles is required to explain the recent
COMPTEL observations of $\gamma$-ray emission in Orion. Supernova ejecta from
one progenitor having lost a large amount of mass are shown to quantitatively
account for the Orion $\gamma$ rays, and to imply the presence of other, weaker
lines and of a supernova explosion in Orion in the last $\la 10^4$ years.
Implications for this mechanism as a mode of nucleosynthesis, and as a
potential supernova diagnostic, are discussed. Model dependences and
uncertainties are noted, and the need is shown for accurate measurements of
$\gamma$-ray and spallation production cross sections at energies near
threshold.

elegant explanation of why the universe is old, large, nearly flat, homogeneous
on large scales and structured on small scales. One of the weaknesses of the
inflationary paradigm is the problem of initial conditions for inflation: the
pre-inflationary universe must be somewhat old, somewhat large and somewhat
homogeneous. These initial condition requirements are even more severe in Omega
< 1 inflationary models: if the universe does not inflate enough to appear
flat, then it does not inflate enough to appear homogeneous. One solution is to
have two inflationary epochs. Here, we propose another solution to the problem
of pre-inflationary homogeneity: if the universe is compact, then during the
pre-inflationary period, there is sufficient time to homogenize the universe as
chaotic mixing smoothes out primordial fluctuations. Gradients in the
energy-density are reduced as e^(-kappa d), where kappa is the
Kolomogorov-Sinai entropy of the flow, and d is the distance the flow travels.
We explore this homogenization process, outline why compact negatively-curved
universes are the most natural, and conclude with a discussion of the
implications of living in such a universe.

clumpy shell in both radio and X-ray emission. For several young remnants,
various arguments suggest that the magnetic field is larger than can be
explained by compression of a few $\mu G$ ambient magnetic field by the shock
wave. Radio polarization studies reveal a net radial orientation of magnetic
fields in the shell which cannot be explained by the simple compression either.
We model Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the interface of the ejecta and the
shocked ambient medium to explain these observations. We have performed
multidimensional MHD simulations of the instability in the shell of a Type-I
supernova remnant for the first time utilizing a moving grid technique which
allows us to follow the growth of the instability and its effect on the local
magnetic field in detail. We find that the evolution of the instability is very
sensitive to the deceleration of the ejecta and the evolutionary stage of the
remnant. As the reverse shock enters the inner uniform density region,
Chevalier's self-similar stage ends and the thickness of radio shell increases
and the instability weakens. Our simulation shows that Rayleigh-Taylor and
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities amplify ambient magnetic fields locally by as
much as a factor of 60 around dense fingers due to stretching, winding, and
compression. Globally, the amount of magnetic-field amplification is low and
the magnetic energy density reaches only about 0.3% of the turbulent energy
density at the end of simulation. Strong magnetic field lines draped around the
fingers produce the radial B-vector polarization, whereas thermal
bremsstrahlung from the dense fingers themselves produce the clumpy X-ray
emission. As a result, the X-ray emission peaks inside of the radio emission.

slab of plasma, optically thin to continuum scattering, and threaded by a
magnetic field of the order $10^{12}$ gauss oriented normal to the slab. Such a
model is appropriate, for example, for the magnetic polar cap of a neutron star
with a dipole field. However, if bursters lie at distances farther than several
hundred parsecs, the burst luminosity exceeds the magnetic Eddington
luminosity, and the plasma in a line-forming region at the magnetic polar cap
would be ejected relativistically along the field lines. Mitrofanov and Tsygan

lensing can be used to measure the mass distribution of the deflector. The
image distortions can be used to define a weighted mean of the mass inside a
circular aperture, as was first suggested by Kaiser. The aperture mass can be
used to {\it detect} dark matter concentrations. Keeping in mind that
wide-field cameras will become increasingly available, this method can be used
to search for mass concentrations on wide-field images. To do this, the
aperture mass measure is generalized to account for different weighting
functions. For each such weighting function, a signal-to-noise ratio can be
calculated. For an assumed mass profile of the density concentrations, the
weighting function can be chosen such as to maximize the resulting
signal-to-noise ratio. Numerical simulations which adopt parameters
characteristic of 4-m class telescopes are then used to show that dark halos
with a velocity dispersion in excess of $\sim 600$\ts km/s can be reliably
detected as significant peaks in the signal-to-noise map. The effects of seeing
and an anisotropic PSF are then investigated and shown to be less important
than might be feared. It is thus suggested that the method of aperture mass
measures developed here can be used to obtain a mass-selected sample of dark
halos, in contrast to flux-selected samples. Shear fields around high-redshift
bright QSOs as detected by Fort et al. provide a first successful application
of this strategy. The simplicity of the method allows its routine application
to wide-field images of sufficient depth and image quality.

With the help of good atmospheric conditions, the excellent performance of the
brand new 3~mm SIS receiver, and 26 hours total observing time we reduced the
noise level to only 63~mJy rms. This allowed us to detect the 0.28~Jy maser
peak. Integrating the flux of the maser profile resulted in a 6.9~${\sigma}$
detection. The SiO maser peak was situated 16~km~s$^{-1}$ redward of the center
of the already known, double peaked OH maser emission. We argue that the SiO
maser peak velocity coincides with the stellar velocity, which is supported by
a spectrum of H$\alpha$ that we took four months later. This would mean that
the outflow velocity of the circumstellar matter around IRAS04553--6825 is
v$_{\rm exp} \sim 26$~km~s$^{-1}$, which is typical for galactic red
supergiants, instead of the abnormally low 11~km~s$^{-1}$ inferred from the OH

with ranges found in galactic RSGs, but the total integrated photon flux is
lower than expected for this extremely red and luminous supergiant.

arbitrary integer, or half-integer, helicity in four dimensions from the
quantization of the rigid particle, whose action is given by the integrated
extrinsic curvature of its worldline, {\ie} $S=\alpha\int ds \kappa$. This
geometrical particle system possesses one extra gauge invariance besides
reparametrizations, and the full gauge algebra has been previously identified
as classical $\W_3$. The key observation is that the covariantly reduced phase
space of this model can be naturally identified with the spinor and twistor
descriptions of the covariant phase spaces associated with massless particles
of helicity $s=\alpha$. Then, standard quantization techniques require $\alpha$
to be quantized and show how the associated Hilbert spaces are solution spaces
of the standard relativistic massless wave equations with $s=\alpha$.
Therefore, providing us with a simple particle model for Weyl fermions
($\alpha=1/2$), Maxwell fields ($\alpha=1$), and higher spin fields. Moreover,
one can go a little further and in the Maxwell case show that, after a suitable
redefinition of constraints, the standard Dirac quantization procedure for
first-class constraints leads to a wave-function which can be identified with
the gauge potential $A_\mu$. Gauge symmetry appears in the formalism as a
consequence of the invariance under $\W_3$-morphisms, that is, exclusively in
terms of the extrinsic geometry of paths in Minkowski space. When all gauge
freedom is fixed one naturally obtains the standard Lorenz gauge condition on
$A_{\mu}$, and Maxwell equations in that gauge. This construction has a direct
generalization to arbitrary integer values of $\alpha$, and we comment on the
physically interesting case of linearized Einstein gravity ($\alpha =2$).

  LaTeX 2e version, uses NFSS2; no changes in contents",,,"DESY 95-234, ITP-UH 27/95","hep-th",,"  In this thesis generalizations of matrix and eigenvalue models involving
supersymmetry are discussed. Following a brief review of the Hermitian one
matrix model, the c=-2 matrix model is considered. Built from a matrix valued
superfield this model displays supersymmetry on the matrix level. We stress the
emergence of a Nicolai-map of this model to a free Hermitian matrix model and
study its diagrammatic expansion in detail. Correlation functions for quartic
potentials on arbitrary genus are computed, reproducing the string
susceptibility of c=-2 Liouville theory in the scaling limit. The results may
be used to perform a counting of supersymmetric graphs.
  We then turn to the supereigenvalue model, today's only successful discrete
approach to 2d quantum supergravity. The model is constructed in a
superconformal field theory formulation by imposing the super-Virasoro
constraints. The complete solution of the model is given in the moment
description, allowing the calculation of the free energy and the multi-loop
correlators on arbitrary genus and for general potentials. The solution is
presented in the discrete case and in the double scaling limit. Explicit
results up to genus two are stated.
  Finally the supersymmetric generalization of the external field problem is
addressed. We state the discrete super-Miwa transformations of the
supereigenvalue model on the eigenvalue and matrix level. Properties of
external supereigenvalue models are discussed, although the model corresponding
to the ordinary supereigenvalue model could not be identified so far.
