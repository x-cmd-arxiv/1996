unprecedented in depth, accuracy and spatial coverage. Our data demonstrate
that Carina has had a surprisingly complex evolution dominated by episodic
bursts of star formation. Comparing the color-magnitude diagram with new
theoretical isochrones, we determine that the ages of the ``bursts'' are
approximately 2, 3--6, and 11--13 Gyr. Note that the ``bursts'' and quiescent
phases lasted for <~1 Gyr, which are much longer than the ~0.1 Gyr dynamical
timescale in the galaxy. Each main-sequence turnoff in Carina connects to a
single red giant branch, which tells us that, regardless of age, Carina stars
are metal-poor with [Fe/H]~= -1.86 and a spread in metal abundance of only 0.2
dex. Thus the process of star formation, and the loss of metal-enriched gas
from supernovae-drive winds, in this low mass dwarf galaxy occurred
episodically over many Gyr rather than in a single, brief episode.

  Summary and Comparisons Among Scenarios","Princeton University Obs., ApJ, in press, tarred, gzipped and

processes, heating and cooling, a variety of cosmological models into the
extreme nonlinear phase to enable comparisons with observations. First, we note
the common, model independent results. All have a mean ($z=0$) temperature of
$10^{4.5}-10^{5.5}$\Kel, set essentially by photoheating processes. Most gas is
in one of two components: either at the photoheating floor $10^{4.5}$\Kel and
primarily in low density regions or else shock heated to $10^5-10^6$\Kel and in
regions of moderate overdensity (in caustics and near groups and clusters). It
presents a major observational challenge to observationally detect this second,
abundant component as it is neither an efficient radiator nor absorber. About
2% to 10% of the baryons cool and collapse into galaxies forming on caustics
and migrating to clusters. About 1%-2% of baryons are in the very hot X-ray
emitting gas near cluster cores, in good agreement with observations. These
correspondances between the simulations and the real world imply that there is
some significant truth to the underlying standard scenarios for the growth of
structure. The differences among model predictions may help us find the path to
the correct model. For COBE normalized models the most relevant differences
concern epoch of structure formation. In the open variants having $\Omega=0.3$,
with or without a cosmological constant, structure formation on galactic scales
is well advanced at redshift z=5, and reionization occurs early. But if
observations require models for which most galaxy formation occurs more
recently than $z=2$, then the flat $\Omega=1$ models are to be preferred. The
velocity dispersion on the $1h^{-1}$Mpc scale also provides a strong
discriminant with, as expected, the $\Omega=1$ models giving a much higher

  Critical Re-Examination","24 pages in RevTex, 9 figures included",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.54.7561",,"cond-mat",,"  We show that it is possible to reconcile NMR and neutron scattering
experiments on both LSCO and YBCO, by making use of the Millis-Monien-Pines
mean field phenomenological expression for the dynamic spin-spin response
function, and reexamining the standard Shastry-Mila-Rice hyperfine Hamiltonian
for NMR experiments. The recent neutron scattering results of Aeppli et al on
LSCO (x=14%) are shown to agree quantitatively with the NMR measurements of
$^{63}T_1$ and the magnetic scaling behavior proposed by Barzykin and Pines.
The reconciliation of the $^{17}T_1$ relaxation rates with the degree of
incommensuration in the spin fluctuation spectrum seen in neutron experiments
is achieved by introducing a new transferred hyperfine coupling $C'$ between
oxygen nuclei and their next nearest neighbor $Cu^{2+}$ spins; this leads to a
near-perfect cancellation of the influence of the incommensurate spin
fluctuation peaks on the oxygen relaxation rates of LSCO. The inclusion of the
new $C'$ term also leads to a natural explanation, within the one-component
model, the different temperature dependence of the anisotropic oxygen
relaxation rates for different field orientations, recently observed by
Martindale $et~al$. The measured significant decrease with doping of the
anisotropy ratio, $R= ^{63}T_{1ab}/^{63}T_{1c}$ in LSCO system, from $R =3.9$
for ${\rm La_2CuO_4}$ to $R ~ 3.0$ for LSCO (x=15%) is made compatible with the
doping dependence of the shift in the incommensurate spin fluctuation peaks
measured in neutron experiments, by suitable choices of the direct and
transferred hyperfine coupling constants $A_{\beta}$ and B.

holes are considered. Our method treats the lattice electrons and the tunneling
electron on an equal footing, and uses a quantum-mechanical calculation of the
collective modes that does not depend in any way on a harmonic approximation.
We find that shakeup produces a series of sidebands that may be identified with
maxima in the collective mode density of states, and definitively distinguishes
the crystal state from a liquid state in the absence of electron-hole
interaction. In the presence of electron-hole interaction, sidebands also
appear in the liquid state coming from short-range density fluctuations around
the hole. However, the sidebands in the liquid state and the crystal state have
different qualitative behaviors. We also find a shift in the main luminescence
peak, that is associated with lattice relaxation in the vicinity of a vacancy.
The relationship of the shakeup spectrum with previous mean-field calculations
is discussed.

TC-GIM models contain exotic fermion families that do not interact under weak

form PGBs, which are the lightest exotic particles in the TC-GIM models. The
spectrum of PGBs consists of color octets, leptoquarks and neutral particles.
The masses of leptoquarks and color octets depend on a free parameter - the
scale of confining interactions. Characteristic for TC-GIM models is a very
light (approx 1 GeV) neutral particle with anomalous couplings to gauge boson
pairs. We show how current experiments constrain the free parameters of the
models. The best tests are provided by the pp --> TT and e^+e^- --> P^0 gamma
reactions. Experiments at LHC and NLC can find PGBs of TC-GIM models in a wide
range of parameter space. However, TC-GIM models can be distinguished from
other TC models only if several PGBs are discovered.
