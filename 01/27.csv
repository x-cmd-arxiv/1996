approach for tracking the evolution of normal galaxies from early epochs to the
present day. The damped Ly alpha systems are particularly suitable for
measuring the properties of what are likely to be the progenitors of
present-day luminous galaxies. We have recently concluded a long-term survey of
30 damped absorbers (including eight from the literature) aimed at measuring
the metallicity and dust content of the universe from redshift z = 3.39 to
0.69. The major conclusions are that the epoch of chemical enrichment in
galaxies may have begun at z = 2.5-3--corresponding to a look-back time of 14
Gyr--and that at z = 2 the typical metallicity was 1/15 of solar. There is
clear evidence for the presence of interstellar dust at z = 2, although several
high-redshift galaxies, particularly the most metal-poor, appear to be
essentially dust-free. We discuss the nature of the damped Ly alpha galaxies in
the light of these and other new results.

the time evolution of the void observed in Bo\""otes. The present density
contrast of the central region ($\sim -0.75$) and its radius ($\sim 30h^{-1} \
Mpc$) are fixed, while the density parameter of the Universe, the amplitude of
the density contrast inside the void wall, the width of this wall and the
distance from the void centre to the Local Group are appropriately varied. The
microwave background anisotropy produced by Bo\""otes-like voids is estimated
for a significant set of locations. All the voids are placed far from the last
scattering surface. It is shown that the anisotropy generated by these voids
strongly depends on the density parameter, the wall structure and the void
location. The Doppler dipole and quadrupole are subtracted and the residual
anisotropy is calculated. In the case of some isolated Bo\""otes-like voids
placed at redshifts between 1 and 10 in an open universe with density parameter
$\Omega_{0}=0.2$, the residual anisotropy appears to be a few times $10^{-6}$
on scales of a few degrees. This anisotropy is about one order of magnitude
greater than previous estimates corresponding to other cases. The anisotropy
produced by a distribution of voids is qualitatively studied in the light of
this result. Comparisons with previous estimates are discussed.

locked in molecular H$_2$, most of the carbon in CO; and H$_2$O, TiO and VO
opacities define a pseudo-continuum covering the entire flux distribution of
these stars. The optical ``continuum'' is due to TiO vibrational bands which
are often used as temperature indicators for these stars. These may be the
depth of the bands relative to the troughs in between them; or the depth of the
VO bands; or of the atomic lines relative to the local ``continuum''; or even
the strength of the infrared water bands; all of these depend on the strength
of the TiO bands and the amount of flux-redistribution to longer wavelengths
exerted by them. Departures from LTE of the Ti I atom, and thus the
concentration of the important TiO molecule, could, therefore, have severe and
measurable consequences on the atmospheric structure and spectra of these

Rev. D51, 176) is developed. The model being a kind of nonlocal extension of
the bosonization procedure is based on the hypothesis that the QCD vacuum is
realized by the (anti-)self-dual homogeneous gluon field. This vacuum field
provides the analytical quark confinement. It is shown that a particular form
of nonlocality of the quark and gluon propagators determined by the vacuum
field, an interaction of quark spin with the vacuum gluon field and a
localization of meson field at the center of masses of two quarks can explain
the distinctive features of meson spectrum: Regge trajectories of radial and
orbital excitations, mass splitting between pseudoscalar and vector mesons, the
asymptotic mass formulas in the heavy quark limit: $M_{Q\bar Q}\to 2m_Q$ for
quarkonia and $M_{Q\bar q}\to m_Q$ for heavy-light mesons. With a minimal set
of parameters (quark masses, vacuum field strength and the quark-gluon coupling
constant) the model describes to within ten percent inaccuracy the masses and
weak decay constants of mesons from all qualitatively different regions of the

  1.Effective long -distance theory describing the collective fields in QCD;
  2.Effective Berry phase potential which is obtained by integrating over the
fast degrees of freedom. As is known, the Berry potential is associated with
induced local gauge symmetry and might be relevant for the compactification
problem at the Planck scale.

symmetry is instantaneously attained and, in some, monopoles with the
symmetries of the regular solids are formed. The simplest example corresponds
to a charge three monopole invariant under a combined inversion and 90 degree
rotation symmetry. In this example three well-separated collinear unit charge
monopoles coalesce to form first a tetrahedron, then a torus, then the dual
tetrahedron and finally separate again along the same axis of motion. We
explicitly construct the spectral curves in this case and use a numerical ADHMN
construction to compute the energy density at various times during the motion.
