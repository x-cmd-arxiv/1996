  Distributions","35 pages, LaTeX, 2 PostScript figures",,,"PUPT-1588","adap-org bayes-an nlin.AO",,"  I define a natural measure of the complexity of a parametric distribution
relative to a given true distribution called the {\it razor} of a model family.
The Minimum Description Length principle (MDL) and Bayesian inference are shown
to give empirical approximations of the razor via an analysis that
significantly extends existing results on the asymptotics of Bayesian model
selection. I treat parametric families as manifolds embedded in the space of
distributions and derive a canonical metric and a measure on the parameter
manifold by appealing to the classical theory of hypothesis testing. I find
that the Fisher information is the natural measure of distance, and give a
novel justification for a choice of Jeffreys prior for Bayesian inference. The
results of this paper suggest corrections to MDL that can be important for
model selection with a small amount of data. These corrections are interpreted
as natural measures of the simplicity of a model family. I show that in a
certain sense the logarithm of the Bayesian posterior converges to the
logarithm of the {\it razor} of a model family as defined here. Close
connections with known results on density estimation and ``information
geometry'' are discussed as they arise.

$T_{crit}$, the emitted Hawking radiation interacts with itself and forms a
nearly thermal photosphere. Using QED, we show that the dominant interactions
are bremsstrahlung and electron-photon pair production, and we estimate
$T_{crit} \sim m_{e}/\alpha^{5/2}$, which when calculated more precisely is
found to be $T_{crit} \approx $45 GeV. The formation of the photosphere is
purely a particle physics effect, and not a general relativistic effect, since
the the photosphere forms roughly $\alpha^{-4}$ Schwarzschild radii away from
the black hole. The temperature $T$ of the photosphere decreases with distance
from the black hole, and the outer surface is determined by the constraint
$T\sim m_{e}$ (for the QED case), since this is the point at which electrons
and positrons annihilate, and the remaining photons free stream to infinity.
Observational consequences are discussed, and it is found that, although the
QED photosphere will not affect the Page-Hawking limits on primordial black
holes, which is most important for 100MeV black holes, the inclusion of QCD
interactions may significantly effect this limit, since for QCD we estimate
$T_{crit}\sim \Lambda_{QCD}$. The photosphere greatly reduces possibility of
observing individual black holes with temperatures greater than $T_{crit}$,
since the high energy particles emitted from the black hole are processed
through the photosphere to a lower energy, where the gamma ray background is
much higher. The temperature of the plasma in the photosphere can be extremely
high, and this offers interesting possibilities for processes such as symmetry
restoration.

Unfortunately, current microlensing experiments measure only one parameter of

underlying physical parameters. Other methods are required to extract
additional information. Parallax measurements using a satellite in an
Earth-like orbit yield the projected velocity of the lens: ${\bf{\tilde v}}
={\bf{v}}/(1-z)$, where ${\bf{v}}$ is the transverse velocity (speed and
direction) of the lens relative to the Earth-source line of sight, and $z$ is
the ratio of the distances to the lens and the source. A measurement of
${\bf{\tilde v}}$ could distinguish between lenses belonging to the bulge and
disk populations. We show that for photometric precisions of 1% to 2%, it is
possible to measure the projected speed, $\tilde v$, to an accuracy of $\leq
10%$ for over 70% of disk lenses and over 60% of bulge lenses. For measuring
the projected velocity ${\bf{\tilde v}}$, the percentages are 40% and {30%},

preferable, and an Earth-satellite separation in the range $0.7 {\rm{AU}} -
1.9{\rm{AU}}$ is optimal. The requirements of the satellite for measuring the
projected velocities of events towards the bulge are similar to those for

$\zz_2^{\otimes N}$ grading of the real compact simple Lie algebra $so(N+1)$ is
presented in an explicit way. It turns out to depend on $2^N-1$ independent
real parameters. The structure of the general graded contractions is displayed
for the low dimensional cases, and kinematical algebras are shown to appear
straightforwardly. The geometrical (or physical) meaning of the contraction
parameters as curvatures is also analysed; in particular, for kinematical
algebras these curvatures are directly linked to geometrical properties of
possible homogeneous space-times.

for the quantum system, a novel model (called AMD-V) is constructed by the
stochastic incorporation of the diffusion and the deformation of wave packets
which is calculated by Vlasov equation without any restriction on the one-body
distribution. In other words, the stochastic branching process in molecular
dynamics is formulated so that the instantaneous time evolution of the averaged
one-body distribution is essentially equivalent to the solution of Vlasov
equation. Furthermore, as usual molecular dynamics, AMD-V keeps the many-body
correlation and can naturally describe the fluctuation among many channels of
the reaction. It is demonstrated that the newly introduced process of AMD-V has
drastic effects in heavy ion collisions of 40Ca + 40Ca at 35 MeV/nucleon,
especially on the fragmentation mechanism, and AMD-V reproduces the
fragmentation data very well. Discussions are given on the interrelation among
the frameworks of AMD, AMD-V and other microscopic models developed for the
nuclear dynamics.

admitting a two generator subalgebra. The modules and the representations of
these algebras are based on the construction of Verma modules, which are
quotient modules, generated by ideals of the original algebra. This
construction unifies a large number of the known algebras under the same
scheme. The finite dimensional representations show new features such as the
multiplicity of representations of the same dimensionality, or the existence of
finite dimensional representations only for some dimensions.
