contour integral for holomorphic differentials. For a class of super curves
(``generic SKP curves'') we define a period matrix. We show that the odd part
of the period matrix controls the cohomology of the dual curve. The Jacobian of
a generic SKP curve is a smooth supermanifold; it is principally polarized,
hence projective, if the even part of the period matrix is symmetric. In
general symmetry is not guaranteed by the Riemann bilinear equations for our
contour integration, so it remains open whether Jacobians are always projective
or carry theta functions.
  These results on generic SKP curves are applied to the study of
algebro-geometric solutions of the super KP hierarchy. The tau function is
shown to be, essentially, a meromorphic section of a line bundle with trivial
Chern class on the Jacobian, rationally expressible in terms of super theta
functions when these exist. Also we relate the tau function and the Baker
function for this hierarchy, using a generalization of Cramer's rule to the
supercase.

scale dependent spectra. The inverse transformation to obtain the linear power
spectrum is applied to the APM Galaxy Survey power spectrum measured by Baugh
\& Efstathiou (1993). The resulting linear spectrum is used to generate the
initial density fluctuations in an N-body simulation, which is evolved to match
the measured APM amplitude on large scales. We find very good agreement between
the final power spectrum of the simulation and the measured APM power spectrum.
However, the higher moments for the particle distribution only match the ones
recovered from the APM Survey on large scales, $R \simgt 10 \mpc$. On small
scales, $R \simlt 10 \mpc$, the APM estimations give smaller amplitudes,
indicating that non-gravitational effects, such as biasing, are important on
those scales. Our approach can be used to constrain a model of how light from

universe with critical density than one with low density, thus offering the
possibility of determining the cosmological density parameter, Omega_0. We
quantify this evolution using the Press-Schechter formalism which we extend to
flat models with a cosmological constant. Using new large N-body simulations,
we verify that this formalism accurately predicts the abundance of rich
clusters as a function of redshift in various cosmologies. We normalise the
models by comparing them to the local abundance of clusters as a function of
their X-ray temperature which we rederive from data compiled by Henry & Arnaud.
This gives values of the rms density fluctuation in spheres of radius 8 Mpc/h
of sigma_8 = (0.50+/- 0.04) Omega_0^{-0.47+0.10 Omega_0} if Lambda_0=0 and
sigma_8 = (0.50 +/- 0.04) Omega_0^{-0.53+0.13 Omega_0} if Lambda_0=1-Omega_0.
These values depend very weakly on the shape of the power spectrum. We then
examine how the distributions of mass, X-ray temperature and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
decrement evolve as a function of Omega_0. We present the expected
distributions at z=0.33 and z=0.5 and the predicted number counts of the
largest clusters. We find that even at z=0.33, these distributions depend very
strongly on Omega_0 and only weakly on Lambda_0. For example, at this redshift,
we expect 20 times as many clusters per comoving volume with M>3.5 10^{14}
Msol/h and 5 times as many clusters with kT>5 keV if Omega_0=0.3 than if
Omega_0=1. The splitting in the integrated counts is enhanced by the larger
volume element in low Omega_0 models. There is therefore a real prospect of
estimating Omega_0 from forthcoming surveys of intermediate redshift clusters
that will determine their masses, X-ray temperatures or SZ decrements.

system of Stuart-Landau equations with complex parameters is used to model the
oscillating wakes. Our purpose is to identify the 6 scalar parameters which
most accurately reproduce the experimental data of Chauve and Le Gal [{Physica
D {\bf 58}}, pp 407--413, (1992)]. To do so, we perform a computational search
for the minimum of a distance $\calj$. We define $\calj$ as the sum-square
difference of the data and amplitudes reconstructed using coupled equations.
The search algorithm is made more efficient through the use of a partially
analytical expression for the gradient $\nabla \cal J$. Indeed $\nabla \cal J$
can be obtained by the integration of a dynamical system propagating backwards
in time (a backpropagation equation for the Lagrange multipliers). Using the
parameters computed via the backpropagation method, the coupled Stuart-Landau
equations accurately predicted the experimental data from Chauve and Le Gal
over a correlation time of the system. Our method turns out to be quite robust
as evidenced by using noisy synthetic data obtained from integrations of the
coupled Stuart-Landau equations. However, a difficulty remains with
experimental data: in that case the several sets of identified parameters are
shown to yield equivalent predictions. This is due to a strong discretization
or ``round-off"" error arising from the digitalization of the video images in
the experiment. This ambiguity in parameter identification has been reproduced
with synthetic data subjected to the same kind of discretization.

These data are compared to YBCO data from a single crystal and from a film on
LaAlO_3 with the same Tc. The main difference between the single crystal and
the film data is that while the single crystal data is well described by a
two-site axial oxygen [O(4)] distribution, we see no evidence for such a
distribution in either thin film sample. We place an upper limit on the size
ofan axial oxygen splitting for the film on MgO at < 0.09 \AA. Therefore, the
magnitude of the splitting is not directly related to Tc. Fits to the
temperature dependent data from the YBCO film on MgO indicate that all bonds
show a smooth change of their broadening factor \sigma, except the Cu-O(4)
bonds, which show an increase in \sigma in the vicinity of Tc, followed by a
decrease of the same magnitude. Such a feature does not occur in diffraction
measurements. Since XAFS measurements of \sigma include any correlation between
the atoms in a given bond, we conclude that the O(4) position becomes less
correlated with the Cu positions near Tc. Correlation measurements of these and
several further near-neighbors are also reported.

density matrix of the universe. We also discuss the connection between their
gravitational action and the topological and volumetric entropies introduced in
hyperbolic geometry. These coincide for hyperbolic 4-manifolds, and increase
with increasing topological complexity of the four manifold. We raise the
questions of whether the action also increases with the topological complexity
of the initial 3-geometry, measured either by its three volume or its Matveev
complexity. We point out, in distinction to the non-supergravity case, that
universes with domains of negative cosmological constant separated by
supergravity domain walls cannot be born from nothing. Finally we point out
that our wormholes provide examples of the type of Perpetual Motion machines

principle for any conformal field theory. A crucial ingredient is a set of
matrices S^J_{ab}, where J is a simple current and a and b are fixed points of
J. We expect that these input matrices realize the modular group for the torus
one-point functions of the simple currents. In the case of WZW-models these
matrices can be identified with the S-matrices of the orbit Lie algebras that
we introduced in a previous paper. As a special case of our conjecture we

when the subject is quantum mechanics. Without a specification of what should
be meant by ``measuring'' a quantum observable, such an expression can have no
clear meaning. A definite specification is provided by Bohmian mechanics, a
theory that emerges from Sch\""rodinger's equation for a system of particles
when we merely insist that ``particles'' means particles. Bohmian mechanics
clarifies the status and the role of operators as observables in quantum
mechanics by providing the operational details absent from standard quantum
mechanics. It thereby allows us to readily dismiss all the radical claims
traditionally enveloping the transition from the classical to the quantum
realm---for example, that we must abandon classical logic or classical
probability. The moral is rather simple: Beware naive realism, especially about
operators!

family of world-vectors. The standard choice of the product corresponds to
timelike and equal vectors which define a ``time"" direction. The generalized
form shows that formulas are simpler if one chooses {\it null\/} directions.
This freedom is used to derive simple covariant formulas for momentum-space
wave functions (generalized Wigner states) corresponding to arbitrary mass and
spin and using eigenstates of the Pauli-Lubanski vector. The eigenstates which
make formulas the simplest correspond to projections of the Pauli-Lubanski
vector on {\it null\/} directions. The new formulation is an alternative to the
