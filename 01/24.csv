background QSOs and foreground galaxies that are supposed to be a consequence
of dark matter inhomogeneities acting as weak gravitational lenses. The method
is based on a weighted average over the galaxy positions and is optimized to
distinguish between a random distribution of galaxies around QSOs and a
distribution which follows an assumed QSO-galaxy two-point correlation
function, by choosing an appropriate weight function. With simulations we
demonstrate that this weighted average is slightly more significant than
Spearman's rank-order test which was used in previous investigations. In
particular, the advantages of the weighted average show up if the two-point
correlation function is weak. We then reanalyze the correlation between
high-redshift 1-Jansky QSOs and IRAS galaxies, taken from the IRAS Faint Source
Catalog; these samples were analyzed previously using Spearman's rank-order
test. In agreement with the previous work, we find moderate to strong
correlations between these two samples; considering the angular two-point
correlation function of these samples, we find a typical scale of order $5'$
from which most of the correlation signal derives. However, the statistical
significance of the correlation changes with the redshift slices of the QSO
sample one considers. Comparing with simple theoretical estimates of the
expected correlation, we find that the signal we derive is considerably
stronger than expected. On the other hand, recent direct verifications of the
overdensity of matter in the line-of-sight to high-redshift radio QSOs obtained
from the shear field around these sources, indicates that the observed
association can be attributed to a gravitational lens effect.

it, placing a constraint on the density of neutral hydrogen in the IGM that was
less than 1 part in 10^5 of that residing in galaxies, and concluded that the
IGM must be highly ionized. Soon afterwards absorption by Lya was detected in
the IGM; not by a diffuse component, but by a clumpy component of intergalactic
gas clouds, the Lya forest. The goal then became to search for `excess'
absorption beyond that expected from the forest. No clear absorption by a
diffuse HI component, however, was ever detected. The results of recent
numerical hydrodynamics computations of the formation of the Lya forest appear
to indicate that the division between a clumpy component and a diffuse one may
be inappropriate. We find that in a CDM-dominated cosmology, no substantial
diffuse medium should be expected. Instead, the medium condenses into a network
of complex structures that reveal themselves as discrete absorption systems in
the spectra of QSOs. The lowest column density lines arise from the fine
structure in minivoids -- small regions with densities below the cosmic mean.
These results suggest that the long sought for diffuse HI Gunn-Peterson effect
may not exist.

the interaction of supernovae with the dense slow winds from the red supergiant
progenitor stars. Observations of planetary nebulae and the nebula around SN
1987A show that the slow winds from extended stars frequently have an axisymme-
tric structure with a high density in the equatorial plane. We have carried out
numerical calculations of the interaction of a supernova with such an axisymme-
tric density distribution. For small values of the angular density gradient at
the pole, the asymmetry in the interaction shell is greater than, but close to,
that expected from purely radial motion. If the angular density gradient is
above a moderate value, the flow qualitatively changes and a protrusion emerges
along the axis. For a power-law supernova density profile, the flow approaches
a self-similar state in which the protrusion length is $2-4$ times the radius
of the main shell. The critical density gradient is larger for steeper density
profiles of the ejecta. Most of our calculations are axisymmetric, but we have
carried out a 3-dimensional calculation to show that the protrusion is not a
numerical artifact along the symmetry axis. For typical supernova parameters,
the protrusions take $\gtrsim$ several years to develop. The appearance of the
shell with protrusions is similar to that observed in VLBI radio images of the
remnant 41.9 +58 in M82 and, possibly, of SN 1986J. We also considered the
possibility of asymmetric ejecta and found that it had a relatively small
effect on the asymmetry of the interaction region.

within molecular clouds. These models use the idea that stars determine their
own masses through the action of powerful stellar outflows. This concept allows
us to calculate a semi-empirical mass formula (SEMF), which provides the
transformation between initial conditions in molecular clouds and the final
masses of forming stars. For a particular SEMF, a given distribution of initial
conditions predicts a corresponding IMF. We consider several different
descriptions for the distribution of initial conditions in star forming
molecular clouds. We first consider the limiting case in which only one
physical variable -- the effective sound speed -- determines the initial
conditions. In this limit, we use observed scaling laws to determine the
distribution of sound speed and the SEMF to convert this distribution into an
IMF. We next consider the opposite limit in which many different independent
physical variables play a role in determining stellar masses. In this limit,
the central limit theorem shows that the IMF approaches a log-normal form.
Realistic star forming regions contain an intermediate number of relevant
variables; we thus consider intermediate cases between the two limits. Our
results show that this picture of star formation and the IMF naturally produces
stellar mass distributions that are roughly consistent with observations. This
paper thus provides a calculational framework to construct theoretical models
of the IMF.

is made more systematic by an asymptotic analysis appropriate to the limits of
fast inhibition, sharp activator interfaces and small asymmetry in the bistable
minima. The resulting contour dynamics is temporally local, with the normal
component of the velocity involving a local contribution linear in the
interface curvature and a nonlocal component having the form of a screened
Biot-Savart interaction. The amplitude of the nonlocal interaction is set by
the activator-inhibitor coupling and controls the ``lateral inhibition""
responsible for the destabilization of localized structures such as spots and
stripes, and the repulsion of nearby interfaces in the later stages of those
instabilities. The phenomenology of pattern formation exhibited by the contour
dynamics is consistent with that seen by Lee, McCormick, Ouyang, and Swinney in
experiments on the iodide-ferrocyanide-sulfite reaction in a gel reactor.
Extensive numerical studies of the underlying partial differential equations
are presented and compared in detail with the contour dynamics. The similarity

certain properties of the Local Potential Approximation (LPA) to the Wilson
renormalization group were uncovered, which led the authors to conclude that
$D>2$ dimensional scalar field theories endowed with {\sl non-polynomial}
interactions allow for a continuum of renormalization group fixed points, and
that around the Gaussian fixed point, asymptotically free interactions exist.
If true, this could herald very important new physics, particularly for the
Higgs sector of the Standard Model. Continuing work in support of these ideas,
has motivated us to point out that we previously studied the same properties
and showed that they lead to very different conclusions. Indeed, in as much as
the statements in hep-th/9406199 are correct, they point to some deep and
beautiful facts about the LPA and its generalisations, but however no new
physics.

a struggle against Doppler broadening. Gedanken experiments which are realistic

inclusive (APEX and EPOS/II --like) apparati. Roughly speaking, the latter
require event-by-event Doppler reconstruction simply to regain an even footing
with the former. This suggests that APEX' or EPOS/II's coincident pair
distributions must be statistically superior to those of EPOS/I or ORANGE in
order to support a comparable inference about sharp structure. Under present
circumstances, independent alternative data is invaluable. Therefore, a
corroboration of Sakai's 330.1 keV ($<$ 3 keV wide) electron line in few MeV
$e^+$ or $e^-$ bombardments of U and Th targets could prove crucial.

  figures, requires epsfig.sty",,,,"quant-ph",,"  This document focuses on translating various information-theoretic measures
of distinguishability for probability distributions into measures of distin-
guishability for quantum states. These measures should have important appli-
cations in quantum cryptography and quantum computation theory. The results
reported include the following. An exact expression for the quantum fidelity
between two mixed states is derived. The optimal measurement that gives rise to
it is studied in detail. Several upper and lower bounds on the quantum mutual
information are derived via similar techniques and compared to each other. Of
note is a simple derivation of the important upper bound first proved by Holevo
and an explicit expression for another (tighter) upper bound that appears
implicitly in the same derivation. Several upper and lower bounds to the quan-
tum Kullback relative information are derived. The measures developed are also
applied to ferreting out the extent to which quantum systems must be disturbed
by information gathering measurements. This is tackled in two ways. The first
is in setting up a general formalism for describing the tradeoff between
inference and disturbance. The main point of this is that it gives a way of
expressing the problem so that it appears as algebraic as that of the problem
of finding quantum distinguishability measures. The second result on this theme
is a theorem that prohibits ""broadcasting"" an unknown (mixed) quantum state.
That is to say, there is no way to replicate an unknown quantum state onto two
separate quantum systems when each system is considered without regard to the
other. This includes the possibility of correlation or quantum entanglement
between the systems. This result is a significant extension and generalization
of the standard ""no-cloning"" theorem for pure states.

quantum computer which is running the program to factor N = 15 while
interacting with a dissipative environment. As a consequence of this
