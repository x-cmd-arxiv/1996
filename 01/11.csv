that generate scale-free spheroidal mass densities in scale-free spherical
potentials. The `case I' DFs are anisotropic generalizations of the flattened
f(E,L_z) model, which they include as a special case. The `case II' DFs
generate flattened constant-anisotropy models, in which the constant ratio of
rms tangential to radial motion is characterized by Binney's parameter beta.
The models can describe the outer parts of galaxies and the density cusp
structure near a central black hole, but also provide general insight into the
dynamical properties of flattened systems.
  The dependence of the intrinsic and projected properties on the model
parameters and the inclination is described. The observed ratio of the rms
projected line-of-sight velocities on the projected major and minor axes of
elliptical galaxies is best fit by the case II models with beta > 0. These
models also predict non-Gaussian velocity profile shapes consistent with
existing observations.
  The distribution functions are used to model the galaxies NGC 2434 (E1) and
NGC 3706 (E4), for which stellar kinematical measurements out to two effective
radii indicate the presence of dark halos (Carollo et al.). The velocity
profile shapes of both galaxies can be well fit by radially anisotropic case II
models with a spherical logarithmic potential. This contrasts with the f(E,L_z)
models studied previously, which require flattened dark halos to fit the data.

due to thermal Comptonization. The X-ray spectral index changes from
$\alpha\sim$ 0.4 to 0.7, and temperature stays at about 50 keV. The X-ray
spectrum varies in such a way that it is consistent with the roughly constant
soft $\gamma$-rays, with pivots at $\sim$ 100 keV. The UV/X-ray correlation
observed by {\it EXOSAT} and {\it IUE} can be explained by two specific models
with reprocessing of X-rays by cold matter. The first one is based on reemision
of the X-ray flux absorbed by clouds in the line of sight. The model predicts
no Compton reflection which is consistent with the broad-band spectra. The
second model, assumes reprocessing of X-rays and $\gamma$-rays by a cold
accretion disk with dissipative patchy corona. The homogenous corona model is
ruled out here, since the hardness of the X-ray spectrum implies that the
plasma is photon starved. The accretion disk model predicts Compton reflection
which is only marginally allowed by the observations. Both our models satisfy
the energy balance, and provide a good fit to the X/$\gamma$-rays and UV data.

sample of galaxies imaged with HST. First, 11% of the galaxies lie off the
normal locus of colour vs. bulge fraction. This class of objects
(""blue-nucleated galaxies"" or BNGs) was first identified using HST observations
(Schade et al. 1995, Ap J, 451, L1), where it was shown that they are
associated with peculiar or asymmetric structures and mergers/interactions. The
observed frequency of BNGs in this sample is 14% for 0.5 < z < 1.2 and 6% at
0.2 < z < 0.5, but the true frequency is likely to be a factor ~2 higher after
corrections are made for the effect of asymmetric/peculiar structures. Second,
galaxy disks at 0.5 < z < 1.1 are found to have a mean rest-frame,
inclination-corrected, central surface brightness of $\mu_{AB}(B)=19.8 \pm 0.1$
mag arcsec$^{-2}$, about 1.6 mag brighter than the Freeman (1970) value. At low
redshift, the mean surface brightness is consistent with the Freeman value.
These results are consistent with the HST observations. With larger numbers of
galaxies and therefore more statistical weight, they demonstrate the
capabilities, and limits, of ground-based work in the study of galaxy
morphology at high redshift.

density increases markedly with redshift. For a (q_0 = 0.5, Omega = 1.0)

turn-on of star-formation at early epochs. A Scalo (1986) IMF extending to the

extant for the powerful radio sources, one relating flat-spectrum QSOs and the

of the Born approximation are sufficient to describe the experimental data of
differential cross section for the electron proton system only at low momentum
transfer square. On the other hand, a two body scattering amplitude with a
relevant form factor may give proper agreement extended to high momentum
transfer square region. A harmonic oscillator wave function is used to
reproduce the data of the experiment at low momentum transfer. This satisfies
quietly the confinement condition of the quarks in the hadron system. However
the data of the experiment at relatively high momentum transfer, show that
hadronic quarks behave more freely and may be described by just a Coulomb wave

skew-symmetric contravariant tensors of even order. The corresponding `Jacobi
identities' are provided by conditions on these tensors, which may be
understood as cocycle conditions. As an example, we provide the linear
generalized Poisson structures which can be constructed on the dual spaces of
simple Lie algebras.

  http://theorl.lbl.gpv/www/theorygroup/papers/38129.ps","Ann.Poincare 64:479-494,1996",,"LBL-38129","quant-ph",,"  In quantum electrodynamics a classical part of the S-matrix is normally
factored out in order to obtain a quantum remainder that can be treated
perturbatively without the occurrence of infrared divergences. However, this
separation, as usually performed, introduces spurious large-distance effects
that produce an apparent breakdown of the important correspondence between
stable particles and poles of the S-matrix, and, consequently, lead to apparent
violations of the correspondence principle and to incorrect results for
computations in the mesoscopic domain lying between the atomic and classical
regimes. An improved computational technique is described that allows valid
results to be obtained in this domain, and that leads, for the quantum
remainder, in the cases studied, to a physical-region singularity structure
that, as regards the most singular parts, is the same as the normal
physical-region analytic structure in theories in which all particles have
non-zero mass. The key innovations are to define the classical part in
coordinate space, rather than in momentum space, and to define there a
separation of the photon-electron coupling into its classical and quantum parts
that has the following properties: 1) The contributions from the terms
containing only classical couplings can be summed to all orders to give a
unitary operator that generates the coherent state that corresponds to the
appropriate classical process, and 2) The quantum remainder can be rigorously
shown to exhibit, as regards its most singular parts, the normal analytic
structure.

derivatives of invertible operators on an arbitrary linear space gives
solutions of the three-wave resonant interaction that can be understood as a
Darboux transformation of the plane wave solutions. The method is extended
further to obtain general Darboux transformations: for any solution of the
three-wave interaction problem and vector solutions of the corresponding Lax
pair large families of new solutions, expressed in terms of Grammian type
determinants of these vector solutions, are given.
