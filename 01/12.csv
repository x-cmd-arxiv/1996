finite temperature, the relaxation time (or transport rates) is free of
infrared divergencies in both longitudinal and transverse interactions. The
resultant relaxation time decreases with time in an expanding plasma like
$1/\tau^\beta$, with $\beta<1$. We prove in this case that thermal equilibrium
will eventually be established given a long life-time of the system. However, a
fixed momentum cut-off in the calculation of the relaxation time gives rise to
a much stronger time dependence which will slow down thermal equilibrium. It is
also demonstrated that the ``memory effect'' of the initial condition affects
the approach to thermal equilibrium and the final entropy production.

for searching for the effects of new physics in a model-independent manner. In
general one assumes that the effects of new physics characterized by a
high-energy scale may be observed at low-energies only through quantum
corrections. These quantum corrections may be described by effective operators
which are constructed from the fields of the low-energy theory; the
coefficients of these operators may be measured via experiment, but a
theoretical determination is only possible once the complete theory is known.
Because the existence or non-existence of a light physical Higgs boson has not
yet been established the inclusion or exclusion of the Higgs field in the
construction of the effective Lagrangian is open to debate. For this reason we
discuss both the linearly realized effective Lagrangian, which includes a light
physical Higgs boson, and the chiral Lagrangian, where the Higgs boson has been
removed by a formal integration. In each scenario the contributions to oblique
parameters and to W-pair-production amplitudes are discussed. Where possible
relationships between the two effective Lagrangians are given.

corrections, including t-channel corrections. The form factors are then
calculated from an effective Lagrangian. Because the existence or non-existence
of a light physical Higgs boson has not yet been established, both a linearly
realized and a non-linearly realized effective Lagrangian are employed. In
either scenario deviations from the Standard Model occur not only in W-pair
production, but in other sectors as well. Effects in W-pair production are
related to effects detected/constrained by the electroweak precision
measurements. With either realization of the symmetry-breaking sector seven
operators contribute to the process $e^+e^-\to W^+W^-$. In the linear
(non-linear) realization, four (three) of these operators are already
stringently constrained via their contributions to processes with four external
fermions. As a result the parameter space which must be explored is manageable.

quantum gravity. Using this framework, quantum geometry is examined.
Fundamental excitations turn out to be one-dimensional, rather like polymers.
Geometrical observables such as areas of surfaces and volumes of regions have
purely discrete spectra. Continuum picture arises only upon coarse graining of
suitable semi-classical states. Next, regulated quantum diffeomorphism
constraints can be imposed in an anomaly-free fashion and the space of
solutions can be given a natural Hilbert space structure. Progress has also

string theory. This symmetry has the interpretaion that it interchanges the
left and the right-moving worldsheet coordinates and reverses the orientations
of some of the spatial coordinates. We also identify another discrete symmetry
of the type II theory which is related to the above one by a nontrivial
U-duality element of string theory. This symmetry, however, has trivial action
on the worldsheet coordinates and corresponds to an improper T-duality
rotation. We then construct examples of type II dual pairs in four dimensions
by modding out the known type II dual pairs by the above symmetries. We show
the explicit matching of the spectrum and supersymmetries in these examples.

such a group is the free product of the cyclic groups of rotations about the

naturally associated with a family of hierarchical tilings of Euclidean
3-space.

Melvin-Morton conjecture states that the bottom line in this expansion is equal

lines are rational functions whose denominators are powers of the Alexander
polynomial. We prove this conjecture for torus knots and give experimental
evidence that it is also true for other types of knots.

tableaux. Furthermore, the momenta of the strings, the energies of the paths,
and the charges of the tableaux are such that there is a weight-preserving
bijection between the two sets of eigenvectors, wherein the tableaux play an
interpolating role. This bijection is so natural, that we conjecture that it
exists in general.
