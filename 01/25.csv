  Accepted for publication in A&A","Astron.Astrophys.312:1000-1011,1996",,,"astro-ph",,"  We have computed new solar models using the same stellar evolution code as
described in Charbonnel, Vauclair and Zahn (1992). This code, originating from
Geneva, now includes the computation of element segregation for helium and 12
heavier isotopes. It may also include any type of mixing of the stellar gas,
provided this mixing may be parametrized with an effective diffusion
coefficient as a function of radius. Here we introduced rotation-induced mixing
as prescribed by Zahn (1992). We present five solar models: the standard model;
two models including pure element segregation; two models with both element
segregation and rotation-induced mixing. The $u = {P \over \rho }$ function
computed as a function of radius in these new solar models are compared to the
helioseismological results obtained for the same function by Dziembowski et al
(1994). Improving the physics of the models leads to a better consistency with
helioseismology. In our best model, which includes both segregation and mixing,
the relative difference in the $ u $ function between the model and the
helioseismological results is smaller than 0.5 per cent at all radii except at
the center and the surface. Meanwhile lithium is depleted by a factor 155 and
beryllium by a factor 2.9, which is consistent with the observations. The
bottom of the convective zone lies at a fractional radius of 0.716, consistent
with helioseismology. The neutrino fluxes are not decreased in any of these
models. The models including the computations of element segregation lead to a
present surface helium abundance of: $ Y_{surf} $ between 0.248 and 0.258,
which is in satisfactory agreement with the value derived from helioseismology.

consider the new features appearing when several moduli fields contribute to
SUSY breaking. In particular, we discuss in detail the case of symmetric
Abelian orbifolds. Although some qualitative features indeed change in the
multimoduli case with respect to the dilaton dominance one, the most natural
mass relations at low-energy, $m_l < m_q \simeq M_g$, are still similar. Only
in some very specific limits these relations might be reversed. We also study
the presence of tachyons pointing out that their possible existence may be, in
some cases, an interesting advantage in order to break extra gauge symmetries.

the mechanism for generating a ``$\mu $-term'' by the K\""ahler potential, as

derived standard-like models. The top quark Yukawa coupling is obtained from a
cubic level mass term while the bottom quark and tau lepton mass terms are
obtained from nonrenormalizable terms. The calculation of the heavy fermion
Yukawa couplings is outlined in detail in a specific toy model. The dependence
of the effective bottom quark and tau lepton Yukawa couplings on the flat
directions at the string scale is examined. The gauge and Yukawa couplings are
extrapolated from the string unification scale to low energies. Agreement with
$\alpha_{strong}$, $sin^2\theta_W$ and $\alpha_{em}$ at M_Z is imposed, which
necessitates the existence of intermediate matter thresholds. The needed
intermediate matter thresholds exist in the specific toy model. The effect of
the intermediate matter thresholds on the extrapolated Yukawa couplings in
studied. It is observed that the intermediate matter thresholds also help to
maintain the correct $b/\tau$ mass relation. It is found that for a large
portion of the parameter space that the LEP precision data for
$\alpha_{strong}$, $sin^2\theta_W$ and $\alpha_{em}$, as well as the top quark
mass and the $b/\tau$ mass relation can all simultaneously be consistent with
the superstring derived standard-like models. Possible corrections due to the
supersymmetric mass spectrum are studied as well as the minimization of the
supersymmetric Higgs potential. It is demonstrated that the calculated values
of the Higgs VEV ratio, $tan\beta=v_1/v_2$, can be compatible with the
minimization of the one-loop effective Higgs potential.

C73 (1996) 119-124",,"NORDITA-96/3 P","hep-ph",,"  Quarkonium production at a given large p_T is dominated by parton
fragmentation: a parton which is produced with transverse momentum p_T/z
fragments into a quarkonium state which carries a fraction z of the parton
momentum. Since parton production cross sections fall steeply with p_T, high z
fragmentation is favored. However, quantum number constraints may require the
emission of gluons in the fragmentation process, and this softens the z
dependence of the fragmentation function. We discuss the possibility that
higher- order processes may enhance the large z part of fragmentation functions
and thus contribute significantly to the quarkonium cross section. An explicit
calculation of light quark fragmentation into eta_c shows that the higher-order
process q -> q eta_c in fact dominates the lowest-order process q -> qg eta_c.
