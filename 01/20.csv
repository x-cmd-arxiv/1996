$w(theta)$, from the APM Galaxy Survey. The performance of various estimators
of $w$ is assessed using simulated galaxy catalogues and analytic arguments.
Several error analyses show that residual plate-to-plate errors do not bias our
estimates of $w$ by more than $10^{-3}$. Direct comparison between our
photometry and external CCD photometry of over 13,000 galaxies from the Las
Campanas Deep Redshift Survey shows that the rms error in the APM plate zero
points lies in the range 0.04-0.05 magnitudes, in agreement with our previous
estimates. We estimate the effects on $w$ of atmospheric extinction and
obscuration by dust in our Galaxy and conclude that these are negligible. We
use our best estimates of the systematic errors in the survey to calculate
corrected estimates of $w$. Deep redshift surveys are used to determine the
selection function of the APM Galaxy Survey, and this is applied in Limber's
equation to compute how $w$ scales as a function of limiting magnitude. Our
estimates of $w$ are in excellent agreement with the scaling relation,
providing further evidence that systematic errors in the APM survey are small.
We explicitly remove large-scale structure by applying filters to the APM
galaxy maps and conclude that there is still strong evidence for more
clustering at large scales than predicted by the standard scale-invariant cold
dark matter (CDM) model. We compare the APM $w$ and the three dimensional power
spectrum derived by inverting $w$, with the predictions of scale-invariant CDM
models. We show that the observations require $Gamma=Omega_0 h$ in the range
0.2-0.3 and are incompatible with the value $Gamma=0.5$ of the standard CDM
model.

rotating black hole are considered for possible signatures of the
frame-dragging effect. We explicitly compare integrated line profiles from a
geometrically thin disk about a Schwarzschild and an extreme Kerr black hole,
and show that the line profile differences are small if the inner radius of the
disk is near or above the Schwarzschild stable-orbit limit of radius 6GM/c^2.
However, if the inner disk radius extends below this limit, as is possible in
the extreme Kerr spacetime, then differences can become significant, especially
if the disk emissivity is stronger near the inner regions. We demonstrate that
the first three moments of a line profile define a three-dimensional space in
which the presence of material at small radii becomes quantitatively evident in
broad classes of disk models. In the context of the simple, thin disk paradigm,
this moment-mapping scheme suggests formally that the iron line detected by the
Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics mission from MCG-6-30-15
(Tanaka et al. 1995) is 3 times more likely to originate from a disk about a
rotating black hole than from a Schwarzschild system. A statistically
significant detection of black hole rotation in this way may be achieved after
only modest improvements in the quality of data. We also consider light curves
and frequency shifts in line emission as a function of time for corotating hot
spots in extreme Kerr and Schwarzschild geometries. Both the frequency-shift
profile and the light curve from a hot spot are valuable measures of orbital
parameters and might possibly be used to detect frame dragging even at radii
approaching 6GM/c^2 if the inclination angle of the orbital plane is large.

the one dimensional Ising model are integrable, and the eigenvalue spacing
statistics are non-universal. In the other cases, the eigenvalue statistics in
the high temperature regime are intermediate between Poisson and G.O.E (with
$P(0)$ of the order of $0.5$). In the intermediate temperature regime, the
statistics are G.O.E.. In the low temperature regime, the statistics have a
peak at $s=0$. In the low temperature regime, and for disordered systems, the
eigenvalues condense around integers, due to the fact that the local field on
any spin never vanishes. This property is still valid for the Ising model on
the Cayley tree, even if it is not disordered. We also study the spacing
between the two largest eigenvalues as a function of temperature. This quantity

independent of theoretical conventions, such as the choice of intermediate

scales which satisfy a transitivity rule which ensures that predictions are
independent of the choice of an intermediate renormalization scheme. QCD can
thus be tested in a new and precise way by checking that the observables track
both in their relative normalization and in their commensurate scale
dependence. For example, the radiative corrections to the Bjorken sum rule at a
given momentum transfer $Q$ can be predicted from measurements of the e+e-
annihilation cross section at a corresponding commensurate energy scale $\sqrt
s \propto Q,$ thus generalizing Crewther's relation to non-conformal QCD. The

qualifies as the loop transform of a regular Borel measure on the moduli space.
In the present article we show how one can compute the finite joint
distributions of a given characteristic functional, that is, we derive the
inverse loop transform.

finite lattice with periodical boundary conditions is expressed through some
specific combination of the partition functions of the model on the torus with
corresponding boundary conditions. The generalization of the duality relations
for the nonhomogeneous case is given. These relations are proved for the
weakly-nonhomogeneous distribution of the coupling constants for the finite
lattice of arbitrary sizes. Using the duality relations for the nonhomogeneous
Ising model, we obtain the duality relations for the two-point correlation
function on the torus, the 2d Ising model with magnetic fields applied to the
boundaries and the 2d Ising model with free, fixed and mixed boundary
conditions.

  PRE",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.55.5448",,"patt-sol nlin.PS",,"  Surface waves on ferrofluids exposed to a dc-magnetic field exhibit a
non-monotonic dispersion relation. The effect of a parametric driving on such
waves is studied within suitable coupled Ginzburg-Landau equations. Due to the
non-monotonicity the neutral curve for the excitation of standing waves can
have up to three minima. The stability of the waves with respect to long-wave
perturbations is determined $via$ a phase-diffusion equation. It shows that the
band of stable wave numbers can split up into two or three sub-bands. The
resulting competition between the wave numbers corresponding to the respective
sub-bands leads quite naturally to patterns consisting of multiple domains of
standing waves which differ in their wave number. The coarsening dynamics of
such domain structures is addressed.
