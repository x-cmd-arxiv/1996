  stefano.galluccio@unifr.ch (e-mail address)",,"10.1088/0305-4470/29/10/005",,"cond-mat q-bio",,"  In the theoretical biology framework one fundamental problem is the so-called
error catastrophe in Darwinian evolution models. We reexamine Eigen's
fundamental equations by mapping them into a polymer depinning transition
problem in a ``genotype'' space represented by a unitary hypercubic lattice.
The exact solution of the model shows that error catastrophe arises as a direct
consequence of the equations involved and confirms some previous qualitative
results. The physically relevant consequence is that such equations are not
adequate to properly describe evolution of complex life on the Earth.

diffusional coefficients and free energy profiles are determined from Monte
Carlo simulations of a 27-mer, 3 letter code lattice model, which corresponds
roughly to a small helical protein. Analytic folding calculations, using simple
diffusive rate theory, agree extremely well with the full simulation results.
Folding in this system is best seen as a diffusive, funnel-like process.

the quark condensates $<{\bar u}u>$ and $<{\bar d}d>$. For the splitting
$(g_{pp\pi_0} - g_{nn\pi_0}) / g_{NN\pi}$ we obtain an interval of $1.2 *

parameters. The charged pion nucleon coupling is found to be the average of

  $\tau_L$ of Reshetikhin-Turaev, Hennings-Kauffman-Radford, and Lyubashenko,
  respectively. In particular, we discuss explicitly how $\tau_L$ specializes
to $\tau_{RT}$ for semisimple categories and to $\tau_{HKR}$ for Tannakian
categories. We give arguments for that $\tau_L$ is the most general invariant
that stems from an extended TQFT. We introduce a canonical, central element,
{\sf Q}, for a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, $\A$, that allows us to apply the
Hennings algorithm directly, in order to compute $\tau_{RT}$, which is
originally obtained from the semisimple trace-subquotient of $\A-mod$.
Moreover, we generalize Hennings' rules to the context of cobordisms, in order
to obtain a TQFT for connected surfaces compatible with $\tau_{HKR}\,$. As an
application we show that, for lens spaces and $\A=U_q(sl_2)\,$, the ratio of
$\tau_{HKR}$ and $\tau_{RT}$ is the order of the first homology group. In the
course of this paper we also outline the topology and the algebra that enter
invariance proofs, which contain no reference to 2-handle slides, but to other
moves that are local. Finally, we give a list of open questions regarding
cellular invariants, as defined by Turaev-Viro, Kuperberg, and others, their
relations among each other, and their relations to the surgical invariants from
above.
