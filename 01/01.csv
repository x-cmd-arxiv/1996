regions (GEHRs) in seven galaxies using optical photometric data in BVR broad
bands and in the emission line of H alpha. Interstellar extinction, metallicity
and nebular contributions to the broad bands are estimated using spectroscopic
data on these objects. Dimensionless diagrams involving B-V and V-R colors and
the flux ratio of Balmer line to B band continuum are used to study star
formation. The cluster colors indicate reduced extinction towards stellar
continuum compared to the values derived from Balmer lines for the ionized gas.
The frequency of detection of classical young (t < 3 Myr) regions with only one
burst of star formation is found to be low as compared to young regions with an
accompanying population rich in red supergiants from a previous burst (t ~ 10
Myr). Reduced extinction towards cluster stars, destruction of ionizing photons
and the existence of older population, often spatially unresolvable from the
younger population, all conspire to make the observed Balmer line equivalent
widths low in a majority of the GEHRs. A scenario of star formation is
suggested which explains many of the observed properties of GEHRs, including
the core-halo structure, reduced extinction for the radiation from stars as
compared to that from the nebular gas, non-detection of young single burst
regions and the co-existence of two populations of different ages.

  6 PostScript figures (Fig.1 missing), full version with all figures available
  at http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~rdejong/papers.html",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In this paper I present a new two-dimensional decomposition technique, which
models the surface photometry of a galaxy with an exponential light profile for
both bulge and disk and, when necessary, with a Freeman bar. The new technique
was tested for systematic errors on both artificial and real data and compared
with widely used one-dimensional decomposition techniques, where the luminosity
profile of the galaxy is used. The comparisons indicate that a decomposition of
the two-dimensional image of the galaxy with an exponential light profile for
both bulge and disk yields the most reproducible and representative bulge and
disk parameters.
  An extensive error analysis was made to determine the reliability of the
model parameters. If the model with an exponential bulge profile is a
reasonable description of a galaxy, the maximum errors in the derived model
parameters are of order 20%. The uncertainties in the model parameters will
increase, if the exponential bulge function is replaced by other often used
bulge functions as the de Vaucouleurs law.
  All decomposition methods were applied to the optical and near-infrared data
set presented by de Jong & van der Kruit (1994), which comprises 86 galaxies in
six passbands.

  Reasoning","See http://www.jair.org/ for any accompanying files","Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 4, (1996), 1-18",,,"cs.AI",,"  Many applications -- from planning and scheduling to problems in molecular
biology -- rely heavily on a temporal reasoning component. In this paper, we
discuss the design and empirical analysis of algorithms for a temporal
reasoning system based on Allen's influential interval-based framework for
representing temporal information. At the core of the system are algorithms for
determining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding
one or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two
important algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a
backtracking algorithm. For the path consistency algorithm, we develop
techniques that can result in up to a ten-fold speedup over an already highly
optimized implementation. For the backtracking algorithm, we develop variable
and value ordering heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically
improve the performance of the algorithm. As well, we show that a previously
suggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce the time
and space requirements of the backtracking search. Taken together, the
techniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning component to solve problems
that are of practical size.

topologies by the method of images. The universes are locally de Sitter
spacetime and anti-de Sitter spacetime. In the present article we study
spacetimes whose spatial topologies are a torus with a cusp and a sphere with
three cusps as a step toward the more general case. A quantum energy momentum
tensor is obtained by the point stripping method. Though the cusps are no
singularities, the latter cusps cause the divergence of the quantum field. This
suggests that only the latter cusps are quantum mechanically unstable. Of
course at the singularity of the background spacetime the quantum field
diverges. Also the possibility of the divergence of topological effect by a
negative spatial curvature is discussed. Since the volume of the negatively
curved space is larger than that of the flat space, one see so many images of a
single source by the non-trivial topology. It is confirmed that this divergence
does not appear in our models of topologies. The results will be applicable to
the case of three dimensional multi black hole\cite{BR}.

quark is approximately degenerate in mass with the $W^{\pm}$ gauge boson,
$m_t\simeq m_W$, leading to values of $R_b$ in better agreement with the
present experimental data than in the Standard Model. The model shares many of
the good features of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model
(MSSM), such as the unification of gauge and Yukawa couplings at a common
high-energy scale. The model differs from the MSSM by re-interpreting the
Tevatron ``top-quark'' events as the production of the fourth generation quark
$t\pri$, which decays dominantly to $bW^+$. The top quark decays primarily into
supersymmetric particles, $t\rta\widetilde t\widetilde\chi^0_1$, with
$\widetilde t\rta c\widetilde\chi^0_1$, thereby evading previous searches.
Light supersymmetric particles are predicted to lie in the mass range between
25 and 70 GeV, which together with the fourth generation leptons provide a rich
spectrum of new physics which can be probed at LEP-2 and the Tevatron.
