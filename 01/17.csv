interpret these results in terms of different mechanisms being responsible for
the X-ray emission in the two classes, namely synchrotron and inverse Compton

two-dimensional (2D) turbulence in the energy transfer subrange is the subject
of this paper. A difficulty specific to this LES and its subgrid scale (SGS)
representation is in that the energy source resides in high wave number modes
excluded in simulations. Therefore, the SGS scheme in this case should assume
the function of the energy source. In addition, the controversial requirements
to ensure direct enstrophy transfer and inverse energy transfer make the
conventional scheme of positive and dissipative eddy viscosity inapplicable to
2D turbulence. It is shown that these requirements can be reconciled by
utilizing a two-parametric viscosity introduced by Kraichnan (1976) that
accounts for the energy and enstrophy exchange between the resolved and subgrid
scale modes in a way consistent with the dynamics of 2D turbulence; it is
negative on large scales, positive on small scales and complies with the basic
conservation laws for energy and enstrophy. Different implementations of the
two-parametric viscosity for LES of 2D turbulence were considered. It was found
that if kept constant, this viscosity results in unstable numerical scheme.
Therefore, another scheme was advanced in which the two-parametric viscosity
depends on the flow field. In addition, to extend simulations beyond the limits
imposed by the finiteness of computational domain, a large scale drag was
introduced. The resulting LES exhibited remarkable and fast convergence to the
solution obtained in the preceding direct numerical simulations (DNS) by
Chekhlov et al. (1994) while the flow parameters were in good agreement with
their DNS counterparts. Also, good agreement with the Kolmogorov theory was

two-dimensional (2D) turbulence is studied using long-term direct numerical
simulations (DNS). We find that nonlinear effects remain strong at all times
and for all scales and establish an inverse energy cascade that extends to the
largest scales available in the system. The large scale flow develops strong
spectral anisotropy: $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov scaling holds for almost all $\phi$,
$\phi=\arctan (k_y/k_x)$, except in the small vicinity of $k_x=0$, where
Rhines's $k^{-5}$ scaling prevails. Due to the $k^{-5}$ scaling, the spectral
evolution of $\beta$-plane turbulence becomes extremely slow which, perhaps,
explains why this scaling law has never before been observed in DNS.
Simulations with different values of $\beta$ indicate that the $\beta$-effect
diminishes at small scales where the flow is nearly isotropic. Thus, for
simulations of $\b$-plane turbulence forced at small scales sufficiently
removed from the scales where $\b$-effect is strong, large eddy simulation
(LES) can be used. A subgrid scale (SGS) parameterization for such LES must
account for the small scale forcing that is not explicitly resolved and
correctly accommodate two inviscid conservation laws, viz. energy and
enstrophy. This requirement gives rise to a new anisotropic stabilized negative
viscosity (SNV) SGS representation which is discussed in the context of LES of
isotropic 2D turbulence.

behavior of complete metrics with constant negative scalar curvature on the
complement of a closed set in a compact Riemannian manifold which are
conformally equivalent to a smooth metric on this compact manifold. When the
closed set is a smooth submanifold, it is known by the results of
Loewner-Nirenberg and Aviles-McOwen that there exists such a complete metric if
and only if $d > (n-2)/2$, and in general the Hausdorff dimension of the set
must be at least $(n-2)/2$. In this paper, we show that the existence of such a
complete conformal metric with constant negative scalar curvature depends on
the tangent structure of the closed set. Specifically, provided the set has a
nice tangent cone at a point, we show that when the dimension of this tangent
cone is less than $(n-2)/2$ there can not exist such a negative Singular Yamabe
metric.

possibility of a large hard core requiring explicit calculation cannot be ruled
out.

position and the only ""real events"" are the measuring results. We argue here
that this narrow view is not forced upon us by the lessons of Quantum Physics.
An alternative language, closer to the intuitive picture of the working
physicist in many areas, is not only possible but warranted. It needs, however,
a different conceptual picture ultimately implying also a different
mathematical structure. Only a rudimentary outline of this picture will be
attempted here. The importance of idealizations, unavoidable in any scheme, is
emphasized. A brief discussion of the EPR-phenomenon is added.
