sequence) $^3$He mass fractions $(10^{-5} \leq X_{3,MS} \leq 10^{-3})$. Armed
with the $^3$He yields from these stellar models we have followed the evolution
of D and $^3$He using a variety of chemical evolution models with and without
infall of primordial or processed material. Production of new $^3$He by the
lower mass stars overwhelms any reasonable primordial contributions and leads
to predicted abundances in the presolar nebula and/or the present interstellar
medium in excess of the observationally inferred values. This result, which
obtains even for zero primordial D and $^3$He, and was anticipated by Rood,
Steigman \& Tinsley (1976), is insensitive to the choice of chemical evolution
model; it is driven by the large $^3$He yields from low mass stars. In an
attempt to ameliorate this problem we have considered a number of non-standard
models in which the yields from low mass stars have been modified. Although
several of these non-standard models may be consistent with the $^3$He data,
they may be inconsistent with observations of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C, $^{18}$O and,
most seriously, the super-$^3$He rich planetary nebulae (Rood, Bania \& Wilson
1992). Even using the most extreme of these non-standard models (Hogan 1995),
we obtain a generous upper bound to pre-galactic $^3$He: X$_{3P} \leq 3.2

near-unity covering factor. The gaseous disks of spiral galaxies are known to
extend to large radii and likely contribute a significant cross-section for
absorption. We perform a Monte-Carlo survey of QSO fields in which the model
galaxies have MgII absorbing ``clouds'' in a spherical halo or in a randomly
oriented disk. For both geometries, models that recover the observed properties
of MgII absorbers have only a 70-80% covering factor. Therefore, regardless of
absorber geometry, a survey of randomly selected QSO fields should yield a
non-negligible number of non-absorbing galaxies at small impact parameters.
Very few have been observed (Steidel (1995)). However, selection effects are
important, and once the observational procedures are applied to our model
fields we find that this result is expected. Since both spherical halo and disk
models can be made consistent with survey results, we present tests for
discerning the geometric distribution of absorbing gas from Hubble Space

transition and the properties of the resulting glass depend on the cooling rate
with which the sample has been quenched. This is done by studying a two
component Lennard-Jones system which is coupled to a heat bath whose
temperature is decreased from a high temperature, where the system is a liquid,
to zero temperature, where the system is a glass. The temperature $T_b$ of the
heat bath is decreased linearly in time, i.e. $T_b=T_0-\gamma t$, where
$\gamma$ is the cooling rate. In accordance with simple theoretical arguments
and with experimental observations we find that the glass transition, as
observed in the specific heat and the thermal expansion coefficient, becomes
sharper when $\gamma$ is decreased. A decrease of the cooling rate also leads
to a decrease of the glass transition temperature $T_g$ and we show that the
dependence of $T_g$ on $\gamma$ can be rationalized by assuming that the
temperature dependence of the relaxation times of the system is given by either
a Vogel-Fulcher law or a power-law. By investigating the structural properties
of the glass, such as the radial distribution functions, the coordination
numbers and the angles between three neighbor-sharing particles, we show how
the local order of the glass increases with decreasing cooling rate. The
enthalpy and the density of the glass decrease and increase, respectively, with
decreasing $\gamma$. By investigating the $\gamma$ dependence of clusters of
nearest neighbors, we show how these observations can be understood from a

various thermodynamical quantities, like entropy, internal energy and heat
capacity. It is shown that the assumption of equality of entanglement entropy
and Bekenstein-Hawking one appears to give inconsistent results. These will be
a starting point for a different interpretation of black hole entropy based on
peculiar topological structures of manifolds with ``intrinsic"" thermodynamical
features. It is possible to show an exact relation between black hole
gravitational entropy (tree level contribution in path integral approach) and
topology of these Euclidean space-times. The expression for the Euler
characteristic, through the Gauss-Bonnet integral, and the one for entropy for
gravitational instantons are proposed in a form which makes the relation
between these self evident. Using this relations I shall propose a
generalization of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in which the former and Euler
characteristic are related in the equation: $S=\chi A/8$. The results, quoted
above, are more largely exposed in previous works. Finally I'll try to expose
some conclusions and hypotheses about possible further development of this
research.

anyons, the minimal covariant set of linear differential equations is
constructed for the fractional spin fields with the help of the deformed
Heisenberg algebra (DHA), $[a^{-},a^{+}]=1+\nu K$, involving the Klein operator
$K$, $\{K,a^{\pm}\}=0$, $K^{2}=1$. The connection of the minimal set of
equations with the earlier proposed `universal' vector set of anyon equations
is established. On the basis of this algebra, a bosonization of supersymmetric
quantum mechanics is carried out. The construction comprises the cases of exact
and spontaneously broken $N=2$ supersymmetry allowing us to realize a
Bose-Fermi transformation and spin-1/2 representation of SU(2) group in terms
of one bosonic oscillator. The construction admits an extension to the case of
OSp(2$\vert$2) supersymmetry, and, as a consequence, both applications of the
DHA turn out to be related. A possibility of `superimposing' the two
applications of the DHA for constructing a supersymmetric (2+1)-dimensional
anyon system is discussed. As a consequential result we point out that
$osp(2|2)$ superalgebra is realizable as an operator algebra for a quantum
mechanical 2-body (nonsupersymmetric) Calogero model.

Furthermore, the total and partial decay widths of the f_0 and a_0 resonances

might be possible to think of a one-parameter family of Maxwell lenses having
the same optical scattering properties in the nodeless radial sector. Although
the relative changes in the index of refraction that one may introduce in this
way are at the level of several percents, at most, for all DO orbital quantum
numbers l\geq 0, the index profiles are different from the original Maxwell
one, possessing an inflection point within the lens. I pass then to the DW full
