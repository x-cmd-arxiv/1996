interferometric observations. Instead, the method is based on single-dish flux
density monitoring of the (unresolved) lens system's total lightcurve, combined
with additional interferometric measurements of the flux density ratio at a few
epochs during that monitoring period. The basic idea of the method is to
reconstruct the individual image lightcurves from the observed total lightcurve
by assuming a range of potential values for the time delay and the
magnification ratio of the images. It is then possible to single out the
correct reconstruction, and therefore determine the time delay, by checking the
consistency of the reconstructed individual lightcurves with the additional
interferometric observations. We performed extensive numerical simulations of
synthetic lightcurves to investigate the dependence of the performance of this
method on various parameters which are involved in the problem. Probably the
most promising candidates for applying the method (and also for determining the
Hubble constant) are lens systems consisting of multiply imaged compact sources
and an Einstein ring, such as B0218+357 from which some of the parameters used
for our simulations were adopted.

fraction of stars in this top-heavy mode of star formation is constrained by
requiring the resulting stellar remnants to account for the observed increase
in the mass-to-light ratio of ellipticals with increasing galaxy mass. We then
consider the implications of this population of massive stars for the
intracluster medium and the extragalactic background at various wavelengths.
The mass and abundance ratios of metals produced by our proposed population of
massive stars are consistent with the observations of the mass and abundance
ratios of metals in the hot gas of galaxy clusters for most of the standard
range of IMF slopes and SN II yields. The predicted energy density produced by
this stellar population approaches current limits on the extragalactic
background at both optical wavelengths, into which the ultraviolet radiation of
the massive stars is likely to be redshifted, and far-infared wavelengths, at
which starlight reprocessed by dust associated with the starburst will be
observed. In either case, the background is predicted to be significantly

of $\gamma$-ray bursts is central to determining if the phenomenon is in fact a
singular one. A unifying concept, beyond isotropy and inhomogeneity of the two
groups separately, is that bursts consist of pulses, organized in time and
energy: wider pulses are more asymmetric, their centroids are shifted to later
times at lower energies, and shorter, more symmetric pulses tend to be
spectrally harder. Long bursts tend to have many pulses while short bursts
usually have few, relatively narrow pulses. Two factors, viewing angle and
beaming, may account for pulse asymmetry and the large dynamic range ($\sim$
200) in pulse widths. A cosmological time-dilation signature, with an expected
dynamic range of order two, would be difficult to measure against these large
intrinsic variations and low signal-to-noise levels of dimmer bursts. Some
statistics ($T_{\rm 90}$, pulse intervals) are particularly sensitive to
brightness bias, noise, and apparently minor variations in definition. Also,
spectral redshift would move narrower, high-energy emission from dim bursts
into the band of observation, constituting a countering effect to time
dilation. With analyses restricted to bursts longer than $\sim$ 2 s, tests for
time dilation that are constructed to be free of brightness bias have yielded
time-dilation factors $\sim$ 2--3, for pulse structures, intervals between
structures, and durations.

the Schwarzschild metric are obtained to first order in $\epsilon =

tensor possesses the exact trace anomaly and the proper asymptotic behavior at
spatial infinity, is conserved with respect to the background metric and is
uniquely defined up to a free parameter $\hat c_2$, which relates to the
average quantum fluctuation of the field at the horizon. We are able to
determine and calculate an explicit upper bound on $\hat c_2$ by requiring that
the entropy due to the back-reaction be a positive increasing function in $r$.
A lower bound for $\hat c_2$ can be established by requiring that the metric
perturbations be uniformly small throughout the region $2M \leq r < r_o$, where
$r_o$ is the radius of perturbative validity of the modified metric. Additional

interesting features emerge. First, provided that the same 16-plet is
responsible for the breaking $SO(10) \rightarrow SU(5)$, the heaviness of the
top can automatically follow from the field content at $M_{GUT}$, without need
of any flavour symmetries. Secondly, the doublet--triplet splitting problem
receives a new natural solution. In addition, a dimension=5 (Higgsino mediated)

dependence of the form factors on the squared four-momentum transfer $q^2$ is
calculated in the whole accessible kinematical region $0 \leq q^2 \leq
q^2_{max}$. For the numerical investigations of the semileptonic $B \to D \ell
\nu_{\ell}$, $B \to \pi \ell \nu_{\ell}$, $D \to K \ell \nu_{\ell}$ and $D \to
\pi \ell \nu_{\ell}$, the equal-time wave functions corresponding to the
updated version of the ISGW model are adopted. Our results for the form factors
and the decay rates are presented and compared with available experimental data
and predictions of different approaches. Moreover, the $K^0_L \to \pi^{\pm} ~
e^{\mp} ~ \nu_e$ decay is briefly discussed. Our approach is consistent with

HERA. It may be that the HERA centre-of-mass energy is sufficiently large that
the production of more than one pair of jets per ep collision becomes possible,
owing to the large number density of the probed gluons. We construct a Monte
Carlo model of such multiparton interactions and study their effects on a wide
range of physical observables. The conclusion is that multiple interactions
could have very significant effects upon the photoproduction final state and
that this would for example make extractions of the gluon density in the photon
rather difficult. Total rates for the production of many (i.e. > 2) jets could
provide direct evidence for the presence of multiple interactions, although
parton showering and hadronization significantly affect low transverse energy

satisfies the Cahn-Hilliard equation with advective transport. A modified
Navier-Stokes equation that incorporates an explicit coupling to the order
parameter field governs fluid flow. It reduces, in the limit of an infinitely
thin interface, to the Navier-Stokes equation within the bulk phases and to two
interfacial forces: a normal capillary force proportional to the surface
tension and the mean curvature of the surface, and a tangential force
proportional to the tangential derivative of the surface tension. The method is
illustrated in two cases: thermo-capillary migration of drops and phase
separation via spinodal decomposition, both in an externally imposed
temperature gradient.

provided by the classical theory of error correcting codes. This leads to a
discussion of error correction in a quantum communication channel or a quantum
computer. Methods of error correction in the quantum regime are presented, and
their limitations assessed. A quantum channel can recover from arbitrary
decoherence of x qubits if K bits of quantum information are encoded using n
quantum bits, where K/n can be greater than 1-2 H(2x/n), but must be less than
1 - 2 H(x/n). This implies exponential reduction of decoherence with only a
polynomial increase in the computing resources required. Therefore quantum
computation can be made free of errors in the presence of physically realistic
levels of decoherence. The methods also allow isolation of quantum
communication from noise and evesdropping (quantum privacy amplification).
