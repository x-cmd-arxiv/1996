  Advanced Study Institute on Thermonuclear Supernovae",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Because Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are not perfect standard candles, it is
important to be able to use distance-independent observables (DIOs) to define
subsets of SNe Ia that are ``nearly standard candles'' or to correct SN Ia
absolute magnitudes to make them nearly homogeneous (``standardized candles'').
This is not crucial for the measurement of H_0, but it is for the measurement
of q_0 and of parent-galaxy peculiar velocities. We discuss the use of various
photometric and spectroscopic SN Ia DIOs, and a parent-galaxy DIO, for this
purpose. We also discuss the status of the absolute-magnitude calibration of
SNe Ia. We find that SNe Ia, whether calibrated by means of (1) Cepheids in
their parent galaxies, (2) fitting their optical-ultraviolet spectra with
detailed non-LTE model atmosphere calculations, or (3) by considering that the
light curve is powered by the decay of radioactive Ni, firmly indicate that the
value of H_0 is low, less than or about 60 km/s/Mpc. Some issues regarding the
determination of q_0 by means of SNe Ia are discussed briefly. Finally, we
conjecture that even if q_0 = 0.5, there probably is no cosmic age problem.

we introduce here a set of local fields whose correlation functions depend
simultaneously on the the two sets of exponents. Thus the Kolmogorov picture of

perturbation theory contain no internal fermion loops, but an arbitrary number
of internal magnetostatic photon lines. By generalizing the Bloch-Nordsieck

such diagrams, and obtain the correct long time behaviour of the retarded
