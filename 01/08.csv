are thus of special interest in terms of their evolutionary origin, but also as

Ia, even those of the dimmer, redder variety. Type Ic also suggest that the
historical classification scheme based on spectra cannot encompass the physical
features of these and closely related events. The Type Ic probably all have a
very small outer layer of helium, but not enough to make them merely a version
of Type Ib. They probably require another evolutionary channel. Similar spectra
near maximum light belie a variety of late-time light curve behavior. Some
events classified as Type Ic, eg SN 1962L, 1983V, 1990B, and 1990U, follow a
relatively slow evolution after maximum light, decaying about 3.0 magnitudes in
V during the first 150 days after maximum. These events seem to belong to a
general category that includes SN 1993J and the Type Ib SN 19983N. Their light
curves decline more rapidly than the expected late-time Co-56 decay with full
trapping, but less rapidly than Type Ia. The late time light curve of these
events seems to be independent of the velocity of the ejecta and hence implies
the trapping of gamma-rays in a manner that is independent of the mass that
participates in the homologous expansion. Other Type Ic, SNe 1983I, 1987M, and

is driven on large scales by the buoyancy of burning products. The turbulent
cascade penetrates down to very small scales, and makes the rate of

turbulent cascade and the freeze-out of turbulent motions due to stellar
expansion determines the largest scale participating in the cascade. This sets
the bulk rate of a deflagration in a supernova. The freeze-out limits the bulk
rate of deflagration to a value that makes a powerful explosion impossible.
Two-dimensional simulations cannot capture these essential elements of
turbulent combustion, even in principle. A powerful delayed detonation
explosion can take place if the burning makes a transition to a detonation. A
deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) can occur in a layer of mixed cold
fuel and hot burning products created either inside an active turbulent burning
region by a high intensity of turbulence, or by mixing cold fuel with ashes of
a dead deflagration front during the global pulsation of a star, or by both.

the total, leptonic and hadronic decay widths of the $Z$ and the effective weak
mixing angle, $\sin^2\theta_W$, measured at LEP and SLC, and the quark-lepton
universality of the weak charged currents measured at low energies, all agree
with the predictions of the SM at a few $\times 10^{-3}$ level. By taking into
account the above constraints I examine implications of three possible
disagreements between experiments and the SM predictions. It is difficult to
interpret the 11\% (2.5-$\sigma$) deficit of the $Z$-partial-width ratio
$R_c=\Gamma_c/\Gamma_h$, since it either implies an unacceptably large
$\alpha_s$ or a subtle cancellation among hadronic $Z$ decay widths in order to
keep all the other successful predictions of the SM. The 2\% (3-$\sigma$)
excess of the ratio $R_b=\Gamma_b/\Gamma_h$ may indicate the presence of a new
rather strong interaction, such as the top-quark Yukawa coupling in the
supersymmetric (SUSY) SM or a new interaction responsible for the large
top-quark mass in the Technicolor scenario of dynamical electroweak symmetry
breaking. Another interpretation may be additional tree-level gauge
interactions that couple only to the third generation of fermions. A common
consequence of these attempts is a rather small $\alpha_s$, $\alpha_s(\mz

of the Konishi current is related to the slope of the beta function at the
critical point. We extend the duality map to the (nonchiral) Konishi current.
As a byproduct we compute the slope of the beta function in the strong coupling
regime. We note that the OPE of $T_{\mu\nu}$ with itself does not close, but
mixes with a special additional operator $\Sigma$ which in general is the
Konishi current. We discuss the implications of this fact in generic
interacting conformal theories. In particular, a SCFT_4 seems to be naturally
equipped with a privileged off-critical deformation $\Sigma$ and this allows us
to argue that electric-magnetic duality can be extended to a neighborhood of
the critical point. We also stress that in SCFT_4 there are two central
charges, c and c', associated with the stress tensor and $\Sigma$,
respectively; c and c' allow us to count both the vector multiplet and the
matter multiplet effective degrees of freedom of the theory.

hydrodynamic variables. The aim of this paper is to exhibit some simple models
in which approximate decoherence arises as a result of local conservation. We
derive a formula which shows the explicit connection between local conservation
and approximate decoherence. We then consider a class of models consisting of a
large number of weakly interacting components, in which the projections onto
local densities may be decomposed into projections onto one of two alternatives
of the individual components. The main example we consider is a one-dimensional
chain of locally coupled spins, and the projections are onto the total spin in
a subsection of the chain. We compute the decoherence functional for histories
of local densities, in the limit when the number of components is very large.
We find that decoherence requires two things: the smearing volumes must be
sufficiently large to ensure approximate conservation, and the local densities
must be partitioned into sufficiently large ranges to ensure protection against
quantum fluctuations.
