  Diffusion Approximation","RevTex, two figures in an attached post-script file",,,,"cond-mat",,"  We use optimal fluctuation method for a new ballistic $\sigma$-model to study
the long time dispersion of conductance $G(t)$ of a mesoscopic sample. In the
long time limit the conductance of a $d$-dimensional sample decays as $\exp (-A
\ln^d t ) $. At shorter times the new results match those in our previous
paper. It is found that at very long times the diffraction effects are
important and the ballistic treatment is not valid. We also suggest a physical
picture of trapping.

"dg-ga/9601004","Thomas Ackermann","Thomas Ackermann","Supersymmetry and the generalized Lichnerowicz formula","20 pages, plain tex",,,,"dg-ga math.DG",,"  A classical result in differential geometry due to Lichnerowicz [8] is
concerned with the decomposition of the square of Dirac operators defined by
Clifford connections on a Clifford module ${\cal E}$\ over a Riemannian
manifold $M$. Recently, this formula has been generalized to arbitrary Dirac
operators [2]. In this paper we prove a supersymmetric version of the
generalized Lichnerowicz formula, motivated by the fact that there is a
one-to-one correspondence between Clifford superconnections and Dirac
operators. We extend this result to obtain a simple formula for the
supercurvature of a generalized Bismut superconnection. This might be seen as a
first step to prove the local index theorem also for families of arbitrary
Dirac operators.

purpose is to elaborate an alternative approach to the problem of integration
over phase space which does not exploit the Monte Carlo principle. The fast and
effective algorithm of integration based on Gauss method is developed for
treating 1--dimensional distributions in two--particle invariant variables. The
algorithm is characterized by significantly improved accuracy and it can meet
requirements of interactive processing.
