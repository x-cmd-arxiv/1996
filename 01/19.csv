  Report also available at http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~gammie/MHD.ps",,"10.1086/177556",,"astro-ph",,"  Using self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we explore the
hypothesis that nonlinear MHD waves dominate the internal dynamics of galactic
molecular clouds. We employ an isothermal equation of state and allow for
self-gravity. We adopt ``slab-symmetry,'' which permits motions $\bf v_\perp$
and fields $\bf B_\perp$ perpendicular to the mean field, but permits gradients
only parallel to the mean field. The Alfv\'en speed $v_A$ exceeds the sound
speed $c_s$ by a factor $3-30$. We simulate the free decay of a spectrum of
Alfv\'en waves, with and without self-gravity. We also perform simulations with
and without self-gravity that include small-scale stochastic forcing.
  Our major results are as follows: (1) We confirm that fluctuating transverse
fields inhibit the mean-field collapse of clouds when the energy in Alfv\'en-
like disturbances remains comparable to the cloud's gravitational binding
energy. (2) We characterize the turbulent energy spectrum and density structure
in magnetically-dominated clouds. The spectra evolve to approximately
$v_{\perp,\,k}^2\approx B_{\perp,\,k}^2/4\pi\rho\propto k^{-s}$ with $s\sim 2$,
  i.e. approximately consistent with a ``linewidth-size'' relation $\sigma_v(R)
\propto R^{1/2}$. The simulations show large density contrasts, with high
density regions confined in part by the fluctuating magnetic fields. (3) We
evaluate the input power required to offset dissipation through shocks, as a
function of $c_s/v_A$, the velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$, and the scale
$\lambda$ of the forcing. In equilibrium, the volume dissipation rate is
$5.5(c_s/v_a)^{1/2} (\lambda/L)^{-1/2}\times \rho \sigma_v^3/L$, for a cloud of
linear size $L$ and density $\rho$. (4) Somewhat speculatively, we apply our

Telescope of the high redshift z=1.824 aligned radio galaxy 3C256. Our
observations confirm that the spatially extended UV continuum emission from
this galaxy is polarized (P_V = 10.9% +/- 0.9%) with the electric vector
perpendicular to the aligned radio and optical major axes (PA = 48.0 +/- 2.4
degrees). This strongly suggests that a significant fraction of the rest frame
UV continuum emission from the galaxy is not starlight, but is instead
scattered light from a powerful AGN which is hidden from our direct view. The
narrow emission lines, including MgII, are unpolarized. The percentage
polarization of the continuum emission and the polarization position angle are
roughly constant as a function of wavelength. The present data do not permit us
to discriminate between cool electrons and dust as the origin of the
scattering. But scattering by hot (T > 10^7 K) electrons cannot be the dominant
process, since such a population would overproduce X-ray emission. A large
population of cooler T ~ 10^4 K electrons could be responsible for both the
line emission and the scattered light, but would require that the dust to gas
ratio in the scattering cones is 0.001 times smaller than that in our Galaxy
and would imply that a large fraction of the baryonic mass in the galaxy is in
the ionized component of its ISM. Dust scattering is more efficient, but would
result in detectable extinction of the emission line spectrum unless the dust
distribution is more highly clumped than the line emitting gas. Finally, we
detect a strong (EW = 12A) broad (FWHM=6500 km/s) absorption line centered at
1477A. We conclude that the most likely explanation is that the absorption is
due to a high velocity BAL cloud near the nucleus of 3C256.

systematic trend along the FP in the orbital radial anisotropy, in the dark

shape of the light profile that would be needed to produce the tilt, under the
assumption of a constant stellar mass to light ratio. Spherical, non rotating,
two--components models are constructed, where the light profiles resemble the
$R^{1/4}$ law. For the investigated models anisotropy cannot play a major role
in causing the tilt, while a systematic increase in the DM content and/or
concentration may formally produce it. Also a suitable variation of the shape
of the light profile can produce the desired effect, and there may be some
observational hints supporting this possibility. However, fine tuning is always
required in order to produce the tilt, while preserving the {\it tightness} of
the galaxies distribution about the FP.

galaxy clusters using the coherent weak distortion of background galaxy images
caused by gravitational lensing. We investigate the effectiveness of this
technique under controlled conditions by creating simulated CCD frames
containing galaxies lensed by a model cluster, measuring the resulting galaxy
shapes, and comparing the reconstructed mass distribution with the original.
Typically, the reconstructed surface density is diminished in magnitude when
compared to the original. The main cause of this reduced signal is the blurring
of galaxy images by atmospheric seeing, but the overall factor by which the
reconstructed surface density is reduced depends also on the signal-to-noise
ratio in the CCD frame and on both the sizes of galaxy images and the magnitude
limit of the sample that is analysed. We propose a method for estimating a
multiplicative compensation factor. We test our technique using a lensing
cluster drawn from a cosmological N-body simulation with a variety of realistic
background galaxy populations and observing conditions. We find that typically
the compensation factor is appreciable, 1.4<f<2.2, and varies considerably
depending on the observing conditions and sample selection. Our method yields a
compensation factor which when used to correct the surface density estimates
produces values that are in good agreement with those of the original cluster.
Thus weak lensing observations when calibrated using this method yield not only
accurate maps of the cluster morphology but also quantitative estimates of the
cluster mass distribution.

susceptibility $\chi(\vec q,\omega)$, which show very universal features at
intermediate doping. In spin dynamics the universality is best seen in the
local spin correlation function, which appears to be $T$-independent and only
weakly doping dependent. Results apply directly to the inelastic neutron
scattering and to the NMR relaxation experiments in cuprates. Analysing
$\sigma(\omega)$ we find that the current correlation function $C(\omega)$ is
nearly $T$- and moreover $\omega$-independent in the regime $T <J$, leading to
the $\sigma(\omega)$ behavior, very close to the marginal Fermi liquid concept

frustration in the doped antiferromagnets. On the other hand, results for the

  I. Complete properly immersed minimal surfaces in $\RR^3$ with finite total

  II. Complete embedded surfaces of constant mean curvature in $\RR^3$ with
finite topology.
  III. Complete conformal metrics of constant positive scalar curvature on $M^n

$\Lam \subset M$ is closed.
  The existence results we discuss for each of these problems are ones whereby
known solutions (sometimes satisfying certain nondegeneracy hypotheses) are
glued together to produce new solutions. Although this sort of procedure is
quite well-known, there have been some recent advances on which we wish to
report here. We also discuss what has been established about the moduli spaces
of all solutions to these problems, and report on some work in progress
concerning global aspects of these moduli spaces. In the final section we
present a new compactness result for the `unmarked moduli spaces' for problem
III.

Firstly, a generalization of the Marsden-Weinstein reduction procedure in
symplectic geometry is presented - this is a reformulation of ideas of
Mikami-Weinstein and Xu. Secondly, it is shown how this procedure is quantized
by Rieffel induction, a technique in operator algebra theory. The essential
point is that a symplectic space with generalized moment map is quantized by a
pre-(Hilbert) C^*-module. The connection with Dirac's constrained quantization
method is explained. Three examples with a single constraint are discussed in
some detail: the reduced space is either singular, or defined by a constraint
with incomplete flow, or unproblematic but still interesting. In all cases, our
quantization procedure may be carried out. Finally, we re-interpret and
generalize Mackey's quantization on homogeneous spaces. This provides a double
illustration of the connection between C^*-modules and the moment map.

one modifies the theory by taking the cycle conditions as constraints, then one
finds that the constraints algebra is first-class only if the Poisson bracket

proposed by Lanczos for the Weyl curvature tensor has not only clarified and

results, and clarify some misunderstandings in the literature. We also clarify
some comments in a recent paper by Dolan and Kim; in addition, we correct some
internal inconsistencies in their paper and extend their results.
  The following new results are also presented. The (computer checked)
complicated second order partial differential equation for the 3-potential, in
arbitrary gauge, for Weyl candidates satisfying Bianchi-type equations is given
-- in those $n $-dimensional spaces (with arbitrary signature) for which the
potential exists; this is easily specialised to Lanczos potentials for the Weyl
curvature tensor. It is found that it is {\it only} in 4-dimensional spaces
(with arbitrary signature and gauge), that the non-linear terms disappear and
that the awkward second order derivative terms cancel; for 4-dimensional
spacetimes (with Lorentz signature), this remarkably simple form was originally
found by Illge, using spinor methods. It is also shown that, for most
4-dimensional vacuum spacetimes, any 3-potential in the Lanczos gauges which
satisfies a simple homogeneous wave equation must be a Lanczos potential for
the Weyl curvature tensor of the background vacuum spacetime. This result is
used to prove that the form of a {\it possible} Lanczos potential proposed by
Dolan and Kim for a class of vacuum spacetimes is in fact a genuine Lanczos
potential for these spacetimes.

inflaton fields are to be associated with flat direction fields of a
supersymmetric theory. Such models predict a very low Hubble constant during
inflation, of order $10^3$-$10^4$ GeV, a scalar density perturbation index $n$

  Letters",,,,"q-alg math.QA",,"  We show that a variation of Milnor's $\bar\mu$-invariants, the so-called
Campbell-Hausdorff invariants introduced recently by Stefan Papadima, are of
finite type with respect to {\it marked singular links}. These link invariants
are stronger than quantum invariants in the sense that they detect easily the
non-invertibility of links with more than one components. It is still open
whether some effectively computable knot invariants, e.g. finite type knot
invariants (Vassiliev invariants), could detect the non-invertibility of knots.

Geom. and Phys",,,"NTZ-preprint 31/1995","q-alg math.QA",,"  We study $N^2-1$ dimensional left-covariant differential calculi on the
quantum group $SL_q(N)$ for which the generators of the quantum Lie algebras
annihilate the quantum trace. In this way we obtain one distinguished calculus
on $SL_q(2)$ (which corresponds to Woronowicz' 3D-calculus on $SU_q(2)$) and
two distinguished calculi on $SL_q(3)$ such that the higher order calculi give
the ordinary differential calculus on $SL(2)$ and $SL(3)$, respectively, in the
limit $q\rightarrow 1$. Two new differential calculi on $SL_q(3)$ are
introduced and developed in detail.
