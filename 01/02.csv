$H \subset \Bbb P^r$ is called a $m$-Hessian if it cuts $X$ along its

of differential operators on a scheme and a subscheme, and higher Euler

candidate X-ray transients is the ionization thermal instability. The disk

reprocessing as the dominant source of optical light, but may play a role in
the ""reflare."" The hard power-law spectrum and radio bursts may be non-thermal
processes driven by the flow of pair-rich plasma from the disk at early times
and due to the formation of a pair-rich plasma corona at late times. The
repeated outbursts suggest some sort of clock, but it is unlikely that it has
anything to do with a simple X-ray heating of the companion star.

recently we believed that inflation automatically leads to flatness of the
universe, Omega = 1. We also thought that post-inflationary phase transitions
in GUTs may occur only after thermalization, which made it very difficult to
have baryogenesis in GUTs and to obtain superheavy topological defects after
inflation. We will describe a very simple version of chaotic inflation which
leads to a division of the universe into infinitely many open universes with
all possible values of Omega from 1 to 0. We will show also that in many
inflationary models quantum fluctuations of scalar and vector fields produced
during reheating are much greater than they would be in a state of thermal
equilibrium. This leads to cosmological phase transitions of a new type, which
may result in an efficient GUT baryogenesis, in a copious production of
topological defects and in a secondary stage of inflation after reheating.

  45 PostScript figures, also available at
  http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~rdejong/papers.html","Astron.Astrophys.313:45-64,1996",,,"astro-ph",,"  The statistics of the fundamental bulge and disk parameters of galaxies and
their relation to the Hubble sequence were investigated by an analysis of
optical and near-infrared observations of 86 face-on spiral galaxies. The
availability of near-infrared K-passband data made it possible for the first
time to trace fundamental parameters related to the luminous mass while hardly
being hampered by the effects of dust and stellar populations. The observed
number frequency of galaxies was corrected for selection effects to calculate
volume number densities of galaxies with respect to their fundamental
parameters. The main conclusions of this investigation are:
  1) Freeman's law has to be redefined. There is no single preferred value for
the central surface brightnesses of disks in galaxies. There is only an upper
limit to the central surface brightnesses of disks, while for lower central
surface brightnesses the number of galaxies per volume element decreases only
slowly as function of the central surface brightness.
  2) The Hubble sequence type index correlates strongly with the effective
surface brightness of the bulge, much better than with the bulge-to-disk ratio.
  3) The disk and bulge scalelengths are correlated.
  4) These scalelengths are not correlated with Hubble type. Hubble type is a
lengthscale-free parameter and each type therefore comes in a range of
magnitudes (and presumably a range of total masses).
  5) Low surface brightness spiral galaxies are not a separate class of
galaxies. In a number of aspects they are a continuation of a trend defined by
the high surface brightness galaxies. Low surface brightness galaxies are in
general of late Hubble type.

semiclassical field theory for individual chaotic systems is constructed in the
framework of the non--linear $\sigma$-model. The low lying modes are shown to
be associated with the Perron--Frobenius spectrum of the underlying
irreversible classical dynamics. It is shown that the existence of a gap in the
Perron-Frobenius spectrum results in a RMT behavior. Moreover, our formalism
offers a way of calculating system specific corrections beyond RMT.

calculations, which scales linearly with the system size and which is well
suited for very large systems. It uses strictly localized pseudoatomic orbitals
as basis functions. The sparse Hamiltonian and overlap matrices are calculated
with an $O(N)$ effort. The long range selfconsistent potential and its matrix
elements are computed in a real-space grid. The other matrix elements are
directly calculated and tabulated as a function of the interatomic distances.
The computation of the total energy and atomic forces is also done in $O(N)$
operations using truncated, Wannier-like localized functions to describe the
occupied states, and a band-energy functional which is iteratively minimized
with no orthogonality constraints. We illustrate the method with several
examples, including carbon and silicon supercells with up to 1000 Si atoms and
supercells of $\beta$-C$_3$N$_4$. We apply the method to solve the existing
controversy about the faceting of large icosahedral fullerenes by performing
dynamical simulations on C$_{60}$, C$_{240}$, and C$_{540}$.
