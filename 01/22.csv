observations of the four solar neutrino experiments. The improved model
includes premain sequence evolution, element diffusion, partial ionization
effects, and all the possible nuclear reactions between the main elements. It
uses updated values for the initial solar element abundances, the solar age,
the solar luminosity, the nuclear reaction rates and the radiative opacities.
Neither nuclear equilibrium, nor complete ionization are assumed. The
calculated $^8$B solar neutrino flux is consistent, within the theoretical and
experimental uncertainties, with the solar neutrino flux measured by
Kamiokande. The results from the $^{37}$Cl and $^{71}$Ga radiochemical
experiments seem to suggest that the terrestrial $^7$Be solar neutrino flux is
much smaller than that predicted. However, the present terrestrial ``defecit''
of $^7$Be solar neutrinos may be due to the use of inaccurate theoretical
neutrino absorption cross sections near threshold for extracting solar neutrino
fluxes from production rates. Conclusive evidence for a real deficit of $^7$Be
solar neutrinos will require experiments such as BOREXINO or HELLAZ. A real
defecit of $^7$Be solar neutrinos can be due to either astrophysical reasons or
neutrino properties beyond the standard electroweak model. Only future neutrino
experiments, such as SNO, Superkamiokande, BOREXINO and HELLAZ, will be able to
provide conclusive evidence that the solar neutrino problem is a consequence of
neutrino properties beyond the standard electroweak model. Earlier indications
may be provided by long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.

hence depends on the value of the mean cosmological density, Omega. Recent
studies have shown that the distribution of dark matter in clusters can be
mapped from analysis of the small distortions in the shapes of background
galaxies induced by weak gravitational lensing in the cluster potential. We
construct new statistics to quantify the morphology of clusters which are
insensitive to limitations in the mass reconstruction procedure. By simulating
weak gravitational lensing in artificial clusters grown in numerical
simulations of the formation of clusters in three different cosmologies, we
obtain distributions of a quadrupole statistic which measures global deviations
from spherical symmetry in a cluster. These distributions are very sensitive to
the value of Omega_0 and, as a result, lensing observations of a small number
of clusters should be sufficient to place broad constraints on Omega_{0} and
certainly to distinguish between the extreme values of 0.2 and 1.

We focus on oscillations between $\overline\nu_e$ with $\overline\nu_\mu$ or
$\overline\nu_\tau$ with those mixing parameters that would solve the solar
neutrino problem. For the small-angle MSW solution ($\Delta
m^2\approx10^{-5}\,\rm eV^2$, $\sin^22\Theta_0\approx0.007$), there are no
significant oscillation effects on the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling signal; we
confirm previous best-fit values for the neutron-star binding energy and
average spectral $\overline\nu_e$ temperature. There is only marginal overlap
between the upper end of the 95.4\% CL inferred range of $\langle
E_{\overline\nu_e}\rangle$ and the lower end of the range of theoretical
predictions. Any admixture of the stiffer $\overline\nu_\mu$ spectrum by
oscillations aggravates the conflict between experimentally inferred and
theoretically predicted spectral properties. For mixing parameters in the
neighborhood of the large-angle MSW solution ($\Delta m^2\approx10^{-5}\,\rm
eV^2$, $\sin^22\Theta_0\approx0.7$) the oscillations in the SN are adiabatic,
but one needs to include the regeneration effect in the Earth which causes the
Kamiokande and IMB detectors to observe different $\overline\nu_e$ spectra. For
the solar vacuum solution ($\Delta m^2\approx10^{-10}\,\rm eV^2$,
$\sin^22\Theta_0\approx1$) the oscillations in the SN are nonadiabatic; vacuum
oscillations take place between the SN and the detector. If either of the
large-angle solutions were borne out by the upcoming round of solar neutrino
experiments, one would have to conclude that the SN~1987A $\overline\nu_\mu$

grows exponentially with the flux. We present a detailed numerical and
