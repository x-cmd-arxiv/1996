$ {\bf C}^2$ at the origin. A classical theorem of Birchoff and Grothendieck
says that any holomorphic vector bundle on the projective plane ${\bf P}^1$
splits into a sum of line bundles. If $E$ is a holomorphic vector bundle over
the blow up of $ {\bf C}^2$ at the origin, then the restriction of $E$ to the
exceptional divisor is a vector bundle over ${\bf P}^1$ and therefore splits.
Moreover we assume that $E$ is a rank two bundle that has zero first Chern
class. Hence its restriction to the exceptional divisor is of the form $ {\cal
O}(j) \oplus {\cal O}(-j) $ for some integer $j.$ We denote by ${\cal M}_j$ the
moduli space of equivalence classes (under holomorphic isomorphisms) of rank
two holomorphic vector bundles on the blow up of $ {\bf C}^2$ at the origin
whose restriction to the exceptional divisor is $ {\cal O}(j) \oplus {\cal
O}(-j) .$

reliable age data. The clusters span Galactocentric distances from 4 through
100 kpc and cover a metallicity range from $[Fe/H] = -0.6$ to $-2.3$. Adopting
currently plausible choices for the relation between cluster metallicity and
horizontal-branch luminosity, and alpha-enhancement ratios, we find that the
majority of the globular clusters form an age distribution with a dispersion
$\sigma(t)$ about $10^9$ years, and a total age spread smaller than 4 Gyr.
Clusters in the lowest metallicity group ($[Fe/H] < -1.8$) appear to be the
same age to well within 1 Gyr at all locations in the Milky Way halo,
suggesting that star formation began throughout the halo nearly simultaneously
in its earliest stages. We find no statistically significant correlation
between mean cluster age and Galactocentric distance (no age gradient) from 4
to 100 kpc. The correlation between cluster age and horizontal-branch type
suggests that causes in addition to metallicity and age are required to
understand the distribution of stars along the horizontal branches in globular

different for different materials. The theoretical arguments are based on the
t-J model as derived from the Hubbard model so that it necessarily includes
three-site terms. We argue that this should be the basic minimal model for
high-Tc systems. We analyze this model starting with the dilute limit which can
be solved exactly, passing then to the Cooper problem which is numerically
tractable, then ending with a mean field approach. It is found that the
relative stability of s-wave and d-wave depends on the size and the shape of
the Fermi surface. We identify three striking trends. First, materials with
large next-nearest-neighbor hopping (such as YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7-x)) are nearly pure
d-wave, whereas nearest-neighbor materials (such as La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4)) tend to
be more s-wave-like. Second, low hole doping materials tend to be pure d-wave,
but high hole doping leads to s-wave. Finally, the optimum hole doping level
increases as the next-nearest-neighbor hopping increases. We examine the
experimental evidence and find support for this idea that gap function in the

Mills equations of motion for spherically symmetric configurations and to
identify the particle numbers of the in- and out-states. A stochastic sampling
technique is then used to map the region spanned by the topology changing
solutions in the energy versus incoming particle number plane and, in
particular, to determine its lower boundary. A lower boundary which approaches
small particle number would be a strong indication that baryon number violation
would occur in high energy collisions, whereas a lower asymptote at large
particle number would be evidence of the contrary. With our method and the
computational resources we have had at our disposal, we have been able to
determine the lower boundary up to energies approximately equal to one and a
half time times the sphaleron energy and observed a 40\% decrease in particle
number with no sign of the particle number leveling off. However encouraging

analytic commutant associative loop (Valya loop). A commutant Lie algebra is an
algebra such that commutant (a subspace which is generated by all commutators)

commutant of this loop is associative subloop (group). We prove that a tangent

resonance and then decays to p$\pi ^+$, either inside or outside the nuclear
medium, are studied. Cross-sections for various kinematics for the (p,p$' \pi
^+$) reaction between 500 MeV and 1 GeV beam energy are calculated to see the
effects of the nuclear medium on the propagation and decay of the resonance.
The cross-sections studied include proton energy spectra in coincidence with
the pion, four momentum transfer distributions, and the invariant p$\pi^+$ mass
distributions. We find that the effect of the nuclear medium on these
cross-sections mainly reduces their magnitudes. Comparing these cross-sections
with those considering the decay of the delta outside the nucleus only, we
further find that at 500 MeV the two sets of cross-sections have large
differences, while by 1 GeV the differences between them become much smaller.

sensitively on the different sources and may be used for their disentangling.
Due to the dominance of the $\eta$-and $\Delta$-Dalitz decays and only a small
anisotropy coefficient for $\pi^+\pi^-$ annihilation, the expected anisotropy
coefficients show a decrease with invariant mass of the dilepton pair and
change only moderately when comparing $p + Be$ and $Ca + Ca$ reactions at the

carried out in a model incorporating a minimal quantal treatment of the
formation of the cluster from its individual nucleons by evaluating the overlap
of intial cascading nucleon wave packets with the final deuteron wave function.
In one approach the nucleon and deuteron center of mass wave packet sizes are
estimated dynamically for each coalescing pair using its past light-cone
history in the underlying cascade, a procedure which yields a parameter free
determination of the cluster yield. A modified version employing a global
estimate of the deuteron formation probability, is identical to a general
implementation of the Wigner function formalism but can differ from the most
frequent realisation of the latter. Comparison is made both with the extensive
existing E802 data for Si+Au at 14.6 GeV/c and with the Wigner formalism. A
globally consistent picture of the Si+Au measurements is achieved. In light of
the deuteron's evident fragility, information obtained from this analysis may
be useful in establishing freeze-out volumes and help in heralding the presence
of high-density phenomena in a baryon-rich environment.
