the on-site pairing correlation function can not be slower than the inverse

effective action for scalar field theories and Euclidean Maxwell theory in the
presence of boundaries. After a comparison of two techniques developed in the
recent literature, vacuum Maxwell theory is studied and the contribution of all
perturbative modes to $\zeta'(0)$ is derived: transverse, longitudinal and
normal modes of the electromagnetic potential, jointly with ghost modes. The
analysis is performed on imposing magnetic boundary conditions, when the
Faddeev-Popov Euclidean action contains the particular gauge-averaging term
which leads to a complete decoupling of all perturbative modes. It is shown
that there is no cancellation of the contributions to $\zeta'(0)$ resulting
from longitudinal, normal and ghost modes.

the relation between monodromies and differential equations rather than using

infinite tower of generic T duality covariant non-singular in stringy frame
F\&H monopoles with the bottomless throat geometry. The massless F = -H
monopoles are invariant under combined T duality and charge conjugation
converting a monopole into anti monopole. All F\&H monopoles can be promoted to
the exact supersymmetric solutions of the heterotic string theory since the
holonomy group is the compact $SO(9)$. The sigma models for ${\bf M}^8$
monopoles, which admit constant complex structures, have enhanced world-sheet
supersymmetry: (4,1) in general and (4,4) for the left-right symmetric
monopoles. The space-time supersymmetric GS light-cone action in monopole
background is directly convertible into the world-sheet supersymmetric NSR
action.

The
experiment was performed with the beam-swinger neutron time-of-flight system at
the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility. Neutrons were detected in
large-volume plastic scintillation detectors located in three detector stations
at 0 deg, 24 deg, and 45 deg with respect to the undeflected beam line; the
flight paths were 91 m, 91 m, and 74 m, respectively. Overall time resolutions
of about 825 ps provided energy resolutions of about 350 keV in the first two
stations and about 425 keV in the third station. The angular distributions for
states with excitation energies up to 10 MeV are presented and comparisons are
made with DWIA calculations that use one-body density matrices from 0hw and 1hw
shell-model calculations. New information is deduced on the excitation
energies, widths and spin-parity assignments for several energy levels of 12N.

Impulse Approximation (DWIA). The elementary eta production operator contains
Born terms, vector meson and nucleon resonance contributions and provides an
excellent description of the recent low energy Mainz measurements on the
nucleon. The resonance sector includes the $S_{11}(1535)$, $P_{11}(1440)$ and
$D_{13}(1520)$ states whose couplings are fixed by independent electromagnetic
and hadronic data. Different models for the $\eta N$ t-matrix are used to
construct a simple $\eta A$ optical potential based on a $t
\rho$-approximation. We find that the exclusive $A(\gamma,\eta N)B$ process can
be used to study medium modifications of the $N^*$ resonances, particularly if
the photon asymmetry can be measured. The inclusive $A(\gamma, \eta)X$ reaction
is compared to new data obtained on $^{12}C$, $^{40}Ca$, and is found to
provide a clear distinction between different models for the $\eta N$ t-matrix.
