producing gamma-ray bursts (GRB's). Inter-galactic magnetic fields $\gtrsim
10^{-12} G$ are required in this model to allow CR's to be observed
continuously in time by producing energy dependent delays in the CR arrival
times. This results in individual CR sources having very narrow observed
spectra, since at any given time only those CR's having a fixed time delay are
observed. Thus, the brightest CR sources should be different at different
energies. The average number of sources contributing to the total CR flux
decreases with energy much more rapidly than in a model of steady CR sources,
dropping to one at $E_{crit} \simeq2\times10^{20}$~eV with very weak
sensitivity to the inter-galactic magnetic field strength. Below $E_{crit}$, a
very large number of sources is expected, consistent with observations. Above
$E_{crit}$, a source may be observed with a flux considerably higher than the
time-averaged CR flux from all sources, if a nearby GRB occurred recently. If
such a source is present, its narrow spectrum may produce a ``gap'' in the
total spectrum. These signatures should be detectable by the planned ``Auger''
CR experiment.

M_V = -1.3 at radial distances between 3 and 22arcmin. Previous metallicity
studies found a non-gaussian metallicity distribution containing a tail of
metal-rich stars. We confirm these results except our unbiased cluster
metallicity distributions are significantly narrower. They contain the
following key features: (1) No very metal-poor stars, (2) a sudden rise in the
metal-poor distribution to a modal [Fe/H] value of --1.70 consistent with an
homogeneous metallicity unresolved at the 0.07 dex level, (3) a tail to higher
metallicities with more stars than predicted by simple chemical evolution
models, and (4) a weak correlation between metallicity and radius such that the
most metal-rich stars are concentrated to the cluster core. The unresolved
metal-weak tail implies that the gas out of which omega Cen formed was
well-mixed up to the modal metallicity of the cluster. Therefore, omega Cen
like other Galactic globular clusters, seems to have formed in a pre-enriched
and homogenized (up to the modal metallicity) environment. The existence of a
weak metallicity gradient supports the idea that omega Cen self-enriched, with
the enriched gas sinking to the cluster center due to gas dissipation
processes. We also note, however, that the metal-rich stars are more massive
than the bulk of the stars in the cluster, and may have sunk to the center by
dynamical mass segregation over the lifetime of the cluster.

Calabi--Yau manifolds which have an interpretation in terms of the special
massless states of a type II string compactification. In those cases where a
dual heterotic description exists the exceptional massless states are due to
genuine strong (string-) coupling effects. A new feature is the appearance of
enhanced non-abelian gauge symmetries in the exact nonperturbative theory.

covariant Haag-Kastler net in Minkowski space. In two dimensional theories,
these states can be interpreted as soliton states and we are interested in the
existence of antisolitons. It is shown that for each soliton state there are
three different possibilities for the construction of an antisoliton sector
which are equivalent if the (statistical) dimension of the corresponding
soliton sector is finite.

decay of various giant resonances in intermediate and heavy mass spherical
nuclei. The approach consists in: (i) the exact continuum-RPA calculations for
amplitudes of the reactions accompanied by excitation and the nucleon decay of
the collective particle-hole states (doorway states); (ii) the Breit-Wigner
parametrization of the RPA reaction-amplitudes in the vicinity of the giant
giant-resonance energy and evaluation of the doorway-state parameter (the
energy, entrance and partial nucleon, escape widths); (iii) the
phenomenological consideration for the doorway-state coupling to many-particle
configurations with the use of reasonable statistical assumptions and
derivation on this base the expressions for the energy-averaged reaction
amplitudes. The nuclear mean field and quasiparticle interaction are the input
quantities for calculations. Examples of description for the direct nucleon
decay of a number of giant resonances in the $^{208}Pb$ parent nucleus are
given together with the comparison with corresponding experimental data.
