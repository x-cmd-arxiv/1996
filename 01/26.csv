with groups of isomorphism classes of holomorphic line bundles with
connections. There is also a geometric description of degree three Deligne
cohomology, due to J-L. Brylinski and P. Deligne, in terms of gerbes with
connective structures and curvings. This paper gives a geometric interpretation
of Deligne cohomology of all degrees, in terms of equivalence classes of higher
line bundles with $k$-connections. It is also shown that the classical
Abel-Jacobi isomorphism $Pic^0(X) \cong J(X)$ generalizes to the isomorphism
between groups of equivalence classes of topologically trivial 1-holomorphic
higher line bundles with $k$-connections and Griffiths intermediate Jacobians.

expanding shells with low densities. Models of these atmospheres show that NLTE
effects are very important and must be included in realistic calculations. We
have, therefore, been improving our atmospheric studies by increasing the
number of ions treated in NLTE. One of the most important ions is Fe II which
has a complex structure and numerous lines in the observable spectrum. In this
paper we investigate NLTE effects for Fe II for a wide variety of parameters.
We use a detailed Fe II model atom with 617 level and 13675 primary lines,
treated using a rate-operator formalism. We show that the radiative transfer
equation in nova atmospheres {\em must} be treated with sophisticated numerical
methods and that simple approximations, such as the Sobolev method, {\em
cannot} be used because of the large number of overlapping lines in the
co-moving frame.
  Our results show that the formation of the Fe II lines is strongly affected
by NLTE effects. For low effective temperatures, $\Teff < 20,000\,$K, the
optical Fe II lines are most influenced by NLTE effects, while for higher
$\Teff$ the UV lines of Fe II are very strongly affected by NLTE. The departure
coefficients are such that Fe II tends to be overionized in NLTE when compared
to LTE. Therefore, Fe II-NLTE must be included with sophisticated radiative
transfer in nova atmosphere models in order to reliably analyze observed nova
spectra.

separated by distances from D=12.5kpc up to 800kpc, and a ``control sample'' of
unrelated lines of sight, are analyzed at redshifts 3, 2, and 1. Coincident
line samples are defined for HI column density thresholds of Nco = 10^{12.5},
10^{13}, and 10^{14} per square cm. We find that: 1) Under the assumption of a
single structure size, a Bayesian analysis yields sizes that are larger for
smaller Nco, and at fixed Nco the size decreases with decreasing redshift.
However, these derived sizes are found to increase with increasing D indicating
that the assumption of a single structure size is invalid. 2) The column
densities of coincident pairs are highly correlated for small D, with
increasing scatter as D is increased, consistent with structures that have a
centrally peaked N(HI) that decreases gradually with radius. 3) The velocity
difference distribution for coincident lines is very narrow for small D, and
widens as D is increased to meet the expectation for chance coincidences in
unrelated lines of sight. This behavior is indicative of organized motion
within the structures. 4) For small D, the distribution of anticoincident line
column densities, Nac, falls steeply as Nac increases from the cutoff value,
but has a significant tail at large values which is inconsistent with a
population of spherical absorbers with sharp edges, and consistent with a
flattened geometry. The conclusions reached on the basis of the DLOS analysis
are validated by an examination of the three-dimensional structures and
velocity flows in the simulation data.

previous periods, allows the region of the parameter space over which control
can be achieved to be extended, but at the price of losing the ability to
achieve superstability. Nonliner feedback results in a larger basin of
attraction to the stabilized orbit than linear feedback. For a simple test
mapping studied (the logistic map) the dimension of the system increases from
one to two by introducing control. We show in the case involving memory, for a
particular choice of the relationship between the control parameters, that the

corollary we get a generalization of the classical Capelli identity.

realize both positive and negative mode generators of a subalgebra of

the system. All features in the supersymmetric case are generalized to the
parasupersymmetric systems of order 2.
