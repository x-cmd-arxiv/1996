This fact allowed significant progress in the understanding of the space of
states of the theory. The analysis of the constraints over loop dependent
wavefunctions has been traditionally based upon geometric (in contrast to
analytic) properties of the loops. The reason for this preferred way is
twofold: for one hand the inherent difficulties associated with the analytic
loop calculus, and on the other our limited knowledge about the analytic
properties of knots invariants. Extended loops provide a way to overcome the
difficulties at both levels. For one hand, a systematic method to construct
analytic expressions of diffeomorphism invariants (the extended knots) in terms
of the Chern-Simons propagators can be developed. Extended knots are simply
related to ordinary knots (at least formally). The analytic expressions of knot
invariants could be produced then in a generic way. On the other hand, the
evaluation of the Hamiltonian over extended loop wavefunctions can be
thoroughly accomplished in the extended loop framework. These two ingredients
promote extended loops as a potential resort for answering important questions
about quantum gravity.

formalism' in covariant classical and quantum mechanics were brought together
to construct a canonical formalism for the relativistic mechanics of many
particles. Drawing on the work of Fock, Stueckelberg, Nambu, Schwinger, and
Feynman, the formalism was raised from the status of a purely formal
mathematical technique to a covariant evolution theory for interacting
particles. In the context of this theory, solutions have been found for the
relativistic bound state problem, classical and quantum scattering in
relativistic potentials, as well as applications in statistical mechanics.
  It has been shown that a generalization of the Maxwell theory is required in
order that the electromagnetic interaction be well-posed in the theory. The
resulting theory of electromagnetism involves a fifth gauge field introduced to
compensate for the dependence of the gauge transformation on the invariant time
parameter; permitting such dependence relaxes the requirement that individual
particles be on fixed mass shells and allows exchange of mass during
scattering. In this paper, we develop the quantum field theory of off-shell
electromagnetism, and use it to calculate certain elementary processes,
including Compton scattering and M{\o}ller scattering. These calculations lead
to {\em qualitative} deviations from the usual scattering cross-sections, which
are, however, small effects, but may be visible at small angles near the
forward direction. The familiar IR divergence of the M{\o}ller scattering is,
moreover, completely regularized.
