degree to which ``confusion'' can be expected to hold in a class of flat,
adiabatic models. This allows us to devise a simple and accurate fitting

  Nuclei","10 pages, 11 postscript figures included",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Radiation emitted from an accretion disk around a massive black hole is a
widely discussed model for the UV/soft X-ray excess emission observed in the
spectra of many AGN. A self-consistent calculation of the structure and the
emerging spectrum of geometrically thin alpha-accretion disks in AGN is
presented. The central object is assumed to be a Kerr black hole; full
relativistic corrections are included. The local dissipation of gravitational
energy is assumed to be entirely due to turbulence. Since these disks are
mainly supported by radiation pressure, the assumption that the viscous energy
production is proportional to the total pressure leads to diverging temperature
structures in the upper parts of the disk, where the total optical depths is
small. We therefore modify the standard expression for the turbulent viscosity
by taking into account the radiative energy loss of turbulent elements in an
optically thin regime. Compton scattering is treated in the Fokker-Planck
approximation using the Kompaneets oparator. The absorption cross section
contains only free-free processes for a pure hydrogen atmosphere. We present
several calculations for various parameters such as the accretion rate, the
viscosity parameter, the specific angular momentum of the black hole and the
inclination angle of the observer. The resulting temperature and density
profiles show that the disks are optically thick for Compton scattering and
effectively optically thin for most frequencies. This leads to spectra that are
diluted with respect to the photon number but contain a Comptonized high energy
tail in order to carry the required energy flux. In addition the electron
temperature deviates strongly from the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the
model can in general account for the observed soft X--ray excess.

Lac objects and all but one quasar are detected in the {\it ROSAT} All-Sky
Survey, the fraction of detected radio galaxies is only $\sim$ 60 per cent. For
the undetected sources upper limits to the X-ray flux are given. We confirm the
correlation of the soft X-ray luminosity (\lx) with the core radio luminosity
(\lc) for galaxies as well as for quasars using partial correlation analysis,
whereas the corresponding correlations between \lx and \lt are probably
spurious due to sample selection effects. We also find strong correlations
between \lx and \lc for both Fanaroff-Riley type I (FR~I) and type II galaxies.
The broad-line radio galaxies (BLRGs) and the quasars are at the top end of the
X-ray luminosity distribution and the detection rate of these objects generally
is higher than that of the narrow- or weak-lined radio galaxies. This indicates
the presence of an anisotropic X-ray component in BLRGs and quasars, as
predicted by unified schemes for radio sources.
