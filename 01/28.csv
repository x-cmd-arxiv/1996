Generalized-Gutzwiller-Approximation. It is found that the metal-insulator
transition occurs at a finite correlation $U_c$ when the average number of
electrons per lattice site is an integer. The critical $U_c$ depends
sensitively on both the band degeneracy $N$ and the filling $x$. A derivation
is presented for the general expression of $U_c(x,N)$ which reproduces all
previously known Gutzwiller solutions, including that of the Boson Hubbard
model. Effects of the lattice structure on the metal-insulator transition and
the effective mass are discussed.

spectrum produced by beta-decay of $^8$B. We place special emphasis on
determining the range of uncertainties permitted by existing laboratory data
and theoretical ingredients (such as forbidden and radiative corrections). We
review and compare the available experimental data on the
$^8$B$(\beta^+){}^8$Be$(2\alpha)$ decay chain. We analyze the theoretical and
experimental uncertainties quantitatively. We give a numerical representation
of the best-fit (standard-model) neutrino spectrum, as well as two extreme
deviations from the standard spectrum that represent the total (experimental
and theoretical) effective $\pm3\sigma$ deviations. Solar neutrino experiments
that are currently being developed will be able to measure the shape of the
$^8$B neutrino spectrum above about 5 MeV. An observed distortion of the $^8$B
solar neutrino spectrum outside the range given in the present work could be
considered as evidence, at an effective significance level greater than three
standard deviations, for physics beyond the standard electroweak model. We use
the most recent available experimental data on the Gamow--Teller strengths in
the $A=37$ system to calculate the $^8$B neutrino absorption cross section on
chlorine: $\sigma_{\rm Cl}=(1.14\pm0.11)\times10^{-42}$~cm$^2$ ($\pm3\sigma$
errors). The chlorine cross section is also given as a function of the neutrino
energy. The $^8$B neutrino absorption cross section in gallium is $\sigma_{\rm
Ga}=(2.46^{+2.1}_{-1.1})\times10^{-42}$ cm$^2$ ($\pm3\sigma$ errors).

be significantly larger than the one occurring in deep inelastic scattering
($\nu\to \infty, ~Q^2\to \infty$). A possibility to measure the neutron
structure functions in the CEBAF experiments with deuterium is analysed. It is
found that disregarding or improperly treating nuclear effects in the region of
nucleon resonances would lead to the ``extraction"" of an unreliable function. A
procedure aimed at correctly extracting the neutron structure function from the
deuterium data is illustrated and conclusions about the experimental study of
the $Q^2$ dependence of the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn Sum Rule for the neutron are
drawn.
