deflection of foreground clusters of galaxies can be used to reconstruct the
two-dimensional surface mass density of these clusters. We apply an unbiased
parameter-free reconstruction technique to the cluster CL0939+4713 (Abell 851),
observed with the WFPC2 on board of the HST. We demonstrate that a single deep
WFPC2 observation can be used for cluster mass reconstruction despite its small
field of view and the irregular shape of the data field (especially for distant
clusters). For CL0939, we find a strong correlation between the reconstructed
mass distribution and the bright cluster galaxies indicating that mass follows
light on average. The detected anti-correlation between the faint galaxies and
the reconstructed mass is most likely an effect of the magnification (anti)
bias, which was detected previously in the cluster A1689. Because of the high
redshift of CL0939 (z_d=0.41), the redshift distribution of the lensed, faint
galaxies has to be accounted for in the reconstruction technique. We derive an
approximate global transformation for the surface mass density which leaves the
mean image ellipticities invariant, resulting in an uncertainty in the
normalization of the mass. From the non-negativity of the surface mass density,
we derive lower limits on the mass inside the observed field. We can break the
invariance transformation for the mass using the magnification effect on the
observed number density of the background galaxies. Assuming a mean redshift of
0.8 and a fraction of 15 % (20 %) of cluster galaxies in the observed galaxy
sample with 23<R<25.5 we obtain for the mass inside the field approximately 5
(7) x 10**{14}/ h_{50} solar masses which corresponds to M/L ~ 100 (140)

  to Astronomy and Astrophysics",,,"MPA 920","astro-ph",,"  In a series of previous papers we have considered the reconstruction of the
surface mass density of a cluster of galaxies from images of lensed faint
background galaxies. We showed that the reconstructed surface mass density is
not uniquely determined, but that there exists a global invariance
transformation that leaves the shape of the images of the lensed galaxies
unchanged. Because of this, only lower limits on the total mass of a cluster
can be derived if no further informations besides image ellipticities are used.
Throughout these papers we used the simplifying assumption that all sources are
at the same redshift. In this paper we account for a redshift distribution of
the faint galaxies, and in particular, some of these galaxies can lie in front
of the cluster or can be cluster members. We show how the mass distribution of
a cluster of galaxies can be obtained from images of these faint galaxies, if
the redshift distribution of these galaxies is known. We demonstrate that for
the reconstruction of non-critical clusters we need less information on the
redshift distribution of the galaxies, i.e., we only need to know two or three
moments of the distribution. We show that the mean mass density across the data
field is still a free variable, i.e., there remains a global invariance
transformation of the resulting mass density field. For non-critical clusters
we can derive the transformation explicitly and it is similar to that derived
previously for the case of a single redshift of the sources. We discuss several
theoretical ideas to break the mass degeneracy; of those considered, we find
that only the magnification effect on the number density of galaxy images can
be used successfully in practice.

approximation be expressed as the zeros of the semiclassical zeta function, a
product over all the periodic orbits of the underlying classical dynamics.
Intermittency originating from the asymptotically separable limit of the
potential at large electron--nucleus distance causes divergences in the
periodic orbit formula. Using a regularisation technique introduced in [G.\

modified cycle expansion, we calculate semiclassical resonances, both position
and width, which are in good agreement with quantum mechanical results obtained

the bound state spectrum obtained here from the classical dynamics of a
scattering system. A quasi Einstein--Brillouin--Keller (QEBK) quantisation is
derived that allows for a description of the spectrum in terms of approximate

supports the mode--coupling approach, which can be understood as a
self--consistent one--loop theory where vertex corrections are neglected.
Therefore, the numerical solution of the mode coupling equations yields very

can be studied. Furthermore, the results from exact Ward identities, as well as
from second--order perturbation theory permit the quantitative evaluation of

severely constrains the momentum dependence of the longitudinal S--wave
multipole $L_{0+}$ at order $q^4$. We give predictions for lower photon
virtualities for the various multipoles and differential cross sections.
Further improvements are briefly touched upon.

the regularization of the infrared behaviour of the solutions. This will then
be used to eliminate certain invariants preselected on dimensional counting
grounds. Then provided we discard nonperiodic solutions as being non physical
we compute the expectation values of the BRST- exact observables with the

Unruh's sonic black hole analogy. We find that there are two qualitatively
different types of particle production in this model: a thermal Hawking flux
generated by ``mode conversion"" at the black hole horizon, and a non-thermal
spectrum generated via scattering off the background into negative free-fall
frequency modes. This second process has nothing to do with black holes and
does not occur for the ordinary wave equation because such modes do not
propagate outside the horizon with positive Killing frequency. The horizon
component of the radiation is astonishingly close to a perfect thermal
spectrum: for the smoothest metric studied, with Hawking temperature
$T_H\simeq0.0008k_0$, agreement is of order $(T_H/k_0)^3$ at frequency
$\omega=T_H$, and agreement to order $T_H/k_0$ persists out to
$\omega/T_H\simeq 45$ where the thermal number flux is $O(10^{-20}$). The flux
from scattering dominates at large $\omega$ and becomes many orders of
magnitude larger than the horizon component for metrics with a ``kink"", i.e. a
region of high curvature localized on a static worldline outside the horizon.
This non-thermal flux amounts to roughly 10\% of the total luminosity for the
kinkier metrics considered. The flux exhibits oscillations as a function of
frequency which can be explained by interference between the various
contributions to the flux.

results state, roughly, that if the configuration manifold carries a hyperbolic

geodesic flow persists in the Euler-Lagrange flows of a large class of
time-periodic Lagrangian systems. This class contains all time-periodic
mechanical systems on such manifolds. Many of the results on Lagrangian systems
also hold for twist maps on the cotangent bundle of hyperbolic manifolds. We
also present a new stability result for autonomous Lagrangian systems on the
two torus which shows, among other things, that there are minimizers of all
rotation directions. However, in contrast to the previously known
\cite{hedlund} case of just a metric, the result allows the possibility of gaps
in the speed spectrum of minimizers. Our negative result is an example of an
autonomous mechanical Lagrangian system on the two-torus in which this gap
actually occurs. The same system also gives us an example of a Euler-Lagrange
minimizer which is not a Jacobi minimizer on its energy level.

distance, as in the case of real polynomials with connected Julia set, as
studied by Sullivan. This class contains several important classes of
generalized polynomial-like maps, namely: Yoccoz, Lyubich, Sullivan and
Fibonacci. In our proof we can not use external arguments (like external
classes). Instead we use hyperbolic sets inside the Julia sets of our maps.
Those hyperbolic sets will allow us to use our main analytic tool, namely
Sullivan's rigidity Theorem for non-linear analytic hyperbolic systems. Lyubich
has constructed a measure of maximal entropy measure $m$ on the Julia set of
any rational function $f$. Zdunik classified exactly when the Hausdorff
dimension of $m$ equals the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set. We show that
the strict inequality holds if $f$ is off-crititcally hyperbolic, except for
Chebyshev polynomials. This result is a particular case of Zdunik's result if
