of the accelerated particle spectrum and decreasing of the acceleration time
scale. It allows for a semi-quantitative evaluation and, in some specific

certain mild luminosity-evolution models. Nearly half of the redshifts lie in
two structures at z ~ 0.81 and z ~ 1.0, showing the presence of high density
concentrations spanning scales of ~ 1/h Mpc, i.e., the size of groups. We find
emission lines or the presence of possible neighbors in 7 of 9 otherwise

note a diversity of morphological types among blue galaxies at z ~ 1, including
small compact galaxies, ``chains,'' and ``blue nucleated galaxies.'' These
morphologies are found among local, but generally less luminous, galaxies.
Distant blue galaxies also include apparently normal late-type spirals. These
findings could imply modest bursts of star formation caused by mergers or
interactions of small, gas-rich galaxies with each other or with larger,
well-formed galaxies. This first glimpse of very faint z ~ 1 field galaxies of

studied from several points of view. The renormalization group approach in
particular has been criticized because it does not take explicitly into account
the difference between spin and charge velocities and because the interaction
should be turned-on before the transverse hopping if the stability of the
Luttinger liquid is a non-perturbative effect. An approach that answers both of
these objections is explained here. It shows that the Luttinger liquid is
unstable to arbitrarily small transverse hopping. The crossover temperatures
below which either transverse coherent band motion or long-range order start to
develop can be finite even when spin and charge velocities differ. Explicit
scaling relations for these one-particle and two-particle crossover
temperatures are derived in terms of transverse hopping, spin and charge
velocities and anomalous exponents. The renormalization group results are
recovered as special cases when spin and charge velocities are identical. The
results compare well with recent experiments presented at this conference.

production predicts decay amplitudes of approximately the correct magnitude and

on relativistic quantum mechanics and includes both entangled state and source
dependent aspects, unlike both of the conventional approaches which use either
equal energies or equal momenta for the different neutrino mass eigenstates. To
second order in the neutrino masses, the standard result is recovered thus
showing an absence of source dependence to this order. The time dependence of
the wavefunction is found to be crucial to recovering the conventional result.
An ambiguity appears at fourth order in the neutrino masses which generally
leads to source dependence, but the standard formula can be promoted to this
order by a plausible convention.

with certain irregular embeddings of higher-level and non-simply laced gauge
groups within level-one simply-laced gauge groups. This identification allows
us to formulate a direct mapping between a given subgroup embedding, and the
sorts of GSO constraints that are necessary in order to realize the embedding
in string theory. This also allows us to determine a number of useful
constraints that generally affect string GUT model-building. For example, most
string GUT realizations of higher-level gauge symmetries G_k employ the
so-called diagonal embeddings G_k\subset G\times G \times...\times G. We find
that there exist interesting alternative embeddings by which such groups can be
realized at higher levels, and we derive a complete list of all possibilities
for the GUT groups SU(5), SU(6), SO(10), and E_6 at levels k=2,3,4 (and in some
cases up to k=7). We find that these new embeddings are always more efficient
and require less central charge than the diagonal embeddings which have
traditionally been employed. As a byproduct, we also prove that it is
impossible to realize SO(10) at levels k>4. This implies, in particular, that
free-field heterotic string models can never give a massless 126 representation

finite box with periodic boundary conditions in the two horizontal directions.
The translational invariance of the problem implies that any solution can be
translated horizontally by an arbitrary amount. Some solutions travel, but
those solutions that are invariant under reflections in both horizontal
directions cannot travel, since motion in any horizontal direction is balanced
by an equal and opposite motion elsewhere. Equivariant bifurcation theory
allows us to understand the steady and time-dependent ways in which a pattern
can travel when a mirror symmetry of the pattern is broken in a bifurcation.
Here we study symmetry-breaking instabilities of convection with a square
planform. A pitchfork bifurcation leads to squares that travel uniformly, while
a Hopf bifurcation leads to a new class of oscillations in which squares drift
to and fro but with no net motion of the pattern. Two types of travelling
squares are possible after a pitchfork bifurcation, and three or more
oscillatory solutions are created in a Hopf bifurcation. One of the three
oscillations, alternating pulsating waves, has been observed in recent
numerical simulations of convection in the presence of a magnetic field. We
also present a low-order model of three-dimensional compressible convection
that contains these symmetry-breaking instabilities. Our analysis clarifies the
relationship between several types of time-dependent patterns that have been

  We construct asymptotic solutions associated with suitable asymptotic zones
and compute the transition functions between the asymptotic solutions in terms
of the trigonometric $R$-matrices. This description of the transition functions
gives a new connection between representation theories of Yangians and quantum
loop algebras and is analogous to the Kohno-Drinfeld theorem on the monodromy
group of the differential Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation.
  In order to establish these results we construct a discrete Gauss-Manin
connection, in particular, a suitable discrete local system, discrete homology
and cohomology groups with coefficients in this local system, and identify an
associated difference equation with the qKZ equation.
