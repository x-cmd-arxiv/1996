introduces a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs

  147-178",,,"cs.AI",,"  Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data. Clustering
systems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality
and the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the
search strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but
be computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both
ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs
a `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative
optimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings.
Given this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial
clusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative
optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search
of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative
optimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been
constructed it is judged by analysts -- often according to task-specific
criteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic
performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over
completed patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this
performance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by
supervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical
clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we
propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures
for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and
simplicity dimensions.

obtained the intriguing result that the quantum properties of geometry affect
the radiation considerably, yielding a definitely non-thermal spectrum. Here,
we replace the simple ansatz employed by Bekenstein and Mukhanov with the
actual eigenstates of the area, computed using the loop representation of
quantum gravity. We derive the emission spectra, using a classic result in
number theory by Hardy and Ramanujan. Disappointingly, we do not recover the
Bekenstein-Mukhanov spectrum, but --effectively-- a Hawking's thermal spectrum.
The Bekenstein-Mukhanov result is therefore likely to be an artefact of the
naive ansatz, rather than a robust result. The result is an example of concrete

gravity.

in the time evolution of spherically symmetric initial data, the first

Then it is shown that for small initial data the solution exists globally in

  at ftp://ftp-itp.unibe.ch/pub/preprints/1995/BUTP-95_13.ps.gz",,,"BUTP-95/13","hep-ph",,"  In CHPT the hadron masses obtain loop corrections from the pseudoscalar
mesons which are identified with the Goldstone bosons of broken chiral
symmetry. An expansion of the baryon mass in the quark masses therefore
includes non-analytic terms. We calculate the nucleon mass in the one-loop
approximation to order $m^4 \sim m_q^2$. We compare the result in the
relativistic and in the heavy mass formulation of the theory and derive
matching relations between corresponding low-energy constants. We calculate the
pion-nucleon loop in old-fashioned perturbation theory and find a contribution
to the $m^4 \ln m$ term from an intermediate state which does not occur in the
heavy baryon theory.

past two decades attempting to characterize the pressure and volume dynamics
the central nervous system compartment. These models have been used to study he
behavior of this compartment under such pathological clinical conditions s
hydrocephalus, head injury and brain edema. The number of different pproaches
has led to considerable confusion regarding the validity, accuracy or
appropriateness of the various models. In this paper we review the mathematical
basis for these models in a mplified fashion, leaving the mathematical details
to appendices. We show at most previous models are in fact particular cases of
a single basic differential equation describing the evolution in time of the
cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CFS). Central to this approach is the hypothsis
that the rate change of CSF volume with respect to pressure is a measure of the
compliance of the brain tissue which as a consequence leads to particular
models epending on the form of the compliance funtion. All such models in fact
give essentially no information on the behavior of the brain itself. More
recent models (solved numerically using the Finite Element Method) have begun
to address this issue but have difficulties due to the lack of information
about the mechanical properties of the brain. Suggestions are made on how
development of models which account for these chanical properties might be
developed.

Mal'cev condition the linear commutator is definable in terms of the

abelian algebra and V(A) satifies an idempotent Mal'cev condition which fails
to hold in the variety of semilattices, then A is affine.

$|W_{coll}| \sim 20-30 eV$ if standard values of DDH parameters are used for
$w_{sp}$. Similar enhancement arises in the P- and T-odd case.
