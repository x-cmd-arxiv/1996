internal component (core) is made of a relativistic gas moving with a
relativistic bulk speed. The second component (sheath or envelope) flows
between the core and external gas with a nonrelativistic speed. Such a
two-component jet describes a variety of possible astrophysical jet
configurations like e.g. (1) a relativistic electron-positron beam penetrating
a classical electron-proton disc wind or (2) a beam-cocoon structure. We
perform a linear stability analysis of such a configuration in the
hydrodynamic, plane-parallel, vortex-sheet approximation. The obtained
solutions of the dispersion relation show very apparent differences with
respect to the single-jet solutions. Due to the reflection of sound waves at
the boundary between sheet and external gas, the growth rate as a function of
wavenumber presents a specific oscillation pattern. Overdense sheets can slow
down the growth rate and contribute to stabilize the configuration. Moreover,
we obtain the result that even for relatively small sheet widths the properties
of sheet start to dominate the jet dynamics. Such effects could have important
astrophysical implications, for instance on the origin of the dichotomy between
radio-loud and radio-quiet objects.

rate is estimated within the WKB approximation. Dissipation effects on a fluxon

experimental resolutions to observe MQT of a fluxon seem attainable within the

study quantum resonance between two stable states, i.e., macroscopic quantum

orders of the expansion. For dimensions three and four one can even go up to
fourth order. This allows a rather thorough empirical investigation of the
convergence properties of the $\delta $-expansion, in particular near the phase
transition or the transition region, respectively. As already found in previous
work, the principle of minimal sensitivity can be only applied for $\beta $
above a certain value, because otherwise no extremum with respect to the
variational parameter exists. One can, however, extend the range of
applicability down to small $\beta $, by calculating instead of $E$ some power
$E^\kappa $, or by performing an appropriate Pad\'e transformation. We find
excellent agreement with the data for $\beta $ above the transition region for
the second and higher orders. Below the transition region the agreement is
rather poor in low orders, but quite impressive in fourth order. For SU(2) we
performed the calculation up to second order. The agreement with the data is

compact type, known to be locally rigid, as projective-algberaic manifolds and
prove that no jump of complex structures can occur. For each $S$ of rank $\ge
2$ there is an associated reductive linear group $G$ such that $S$ admits a
holomorphic $G$-structure, corresponding to a reduction of the structure group
of the tangent bundle. $S$ is characterized as the unique simply-connected
compact complex manifold admitting such a $G$-structure which is at the same
time integrable. To prove the deformation rigidity of $S$ it suffices that the
corresponding integrable $G$-structures converge.
  We argue by contradiction using the deformation theory of rational curves.
Assuming that a jump of complex structures occurs, cones of vectors tangent to
degree-1 rational curves on the special fiber $X_0$ are linearly degenerate,
thus defining a proper meromorphic distribution $W$ on $X_0$. We prove that
such $W$ cannot possibly exist. On the one hand, integrability of $W$ would
contradict the fact that $b_2(X)=1$. On the other hand, we prove that $W$ would
be automatically integrable by producing families of integral complex surfaces
of $W$ as pencils of degree-1 rational curves. For the verification that there
are enough integral surfaces we need a description of generic cones on the
special fiber. We show that they are in fact images of standard cones under
linear projections. We achieve this by studying deformations of normalizations
of Chow spaces of minimal rational curves marked at a point, which are
themselves Hermitian symmetric, irreducible except in the case of
Grassmannians.

given by one of three possibilites: (a) Aluminum is indeed brittle at zero

pre-existing dislocations which relax the stress concentration at the crack

logic gates, we find the fidelity of the stored qubit as a function of time,
including decoherence which occurs not only during storage but also during
processing. We generalize our results to include any source of error, and
derive an upper limit on the allowable decoherence per timestep. Physically,
our results suggest the feasibility of engineering artificial metastable states
through repeated error correction.

computing unless successful error correction techniques are developed. To this
end, we have discovered a new scheme for perfectly detecting and rejecting the
error caused by loss (amplitude damping to a reservoir at T=0), based on using
a dual-rail representation of a quantum bit. This is possible because (1)
balanced loss does not perform a ``which-path'' measurement in an
interferometer, and (2) balanced quantum nondemolition measurement of the
``total'' photon number can be used to detect loss-induced quantum jumps
without disturbing the quantum coherence essential to the quantum bit. Our
results are immediately applicable to optical quantum computers using single
photonics devices.

second-class constraints from the point of view of coherent-state phase-space
path integration reveals several significant distinctions from more
conventional treatments. Most significantly, we emphasize the importance of
using path-integral measures for Lagrange multipliers which ensure that the
quantum system satisfies the quantum constraint conditions. Our procedures
involve no delta-functionals of the classical constraints, no need for gauge
fixing of first-class constraints, no need to eliminate second-class
constraints, no potentially ambiguous determinants, and have the virtue of
resolving differences between canonical and path-integral approaches. Several
examples are considered in detail.
