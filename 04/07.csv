  Formation of Giant Galaxies","14 pages, Latex(aaspp4.sty), 3 encap. ps figs",,"10.1086/310190",,"astro-ph",,"  A recent observation of Steidel et al. indicates that a substantial fraction
of giant galaxies were formed at an epoch as early as redshift $z>3-3.5$. We
show that this early formation of giant galaxies gives strong constraints on
models of cosmic structure formation. Adopting the COBE normalization for the
density perturbation spectrum, we argue that the following models do not have
large enough power on galactic scales to yield the observed abundance: (i)
standard cold dark matter (CDM) models (where mass density $\Omega_0=1$ and
power index $n=1$) with the Hubble constant $h\lsim 0.35$; (ii) tilted CDM
models with $h=0.5$ and $n\lsim 0.75$; (iii) open CDM models with $h\lsim 0.8$
and $\Omega_0 \lsim 0.3$, and (iv) mixed dark matter models with $h=0.5$ and
$\Omega _\nu \gsim 0.2$. Flat CDM models with a cosmological constant
$\lambda_0 \sim 0.7$ are consistent with the observation, provided that $h\gsim
0.6$. Combined with constraints from large-scale structure formation, these
results imply that the flat CDM model with a low $\Omega_0$ is the only one
that is fully consistent with observations. We predict that these high-redshift
galaxies are more strongly clustered than normal galaxies observed today.

proven to be chiral bosonic excitations, with the same spectrum as the density

To obtain the bosonic theory we find that it is useful to apply the boson
expansion method which is the standard technique in quantum many-body physics.
We introduce bilocal boson operators to represent the gauge-invariant quark
bilinears and then local boson operators as the collective states of the
bilocal bosons. If we adopt the Holstein-Primakoff type among various
representations, we obtain a theory of infinitely many interacting bosons,
whose masses are the eigenvalues of the 't Hooft equation. In the large $N$
limit, since the interaction disappears and the bosons are identified with
mesons, we obtain a free Hamiltonian with infinite kinds of mesons.
