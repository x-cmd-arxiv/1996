of the central 20'' of five galaxies containing circumnuclear star-forming
rings. The five galaxies are from a well-defined sample of 103 normal, nearby
galaxies we have observed with HST. At the HST resolution (0.05''), the rings
break up into discrete star-forming clumps, each composed of many luminous and
compact ($R \ltorder 5$ pc) star clusters. These objects are similar to those
that have been recently reported in colliding and starburst galaxies, and in
several other circumnuclear rings. A large fraction, 15%--50%, of the UV
emission originates in these compact clusters. Compact clusters therefore may
be the preferred mode of star formation in starburst environments. For one
galaxy, NGC 2997, we measure the UV-optical colors of the individual clusters
using an archival HST WFPC2 image at 6000 Ang . Comparing the colors and
luminosities to starburst population synthesis models, we show that the
clusters are less than 100 Myr old and have masses of at least a few $10^3
M_{\odot}$, with some as high as $10^5 M_{\odot}$. The UV extinction to those
clusters that are detected in the UV is at most a factor of 10. In NGC 2997,
the limits on the masses and the ages of the young clusters indicate that these
objects will remain bound and evolve into globular clusters. The luminosity
function of the clusters in the rings is similar in shape to those measured for
super star clusters in other star-forming galaxies, and extends to luminosities
lower by several orders of magnitude. All five of the UV-detected circumnuclear
rings occur in barred or weakly barred spiral galaxies of type Sc or earlier.
None of the five rings has an active nucleus at its center, arguing against a

dimensions, of the tidal perturbation of accretion discs in binary systems
where the orbit is circular and not necessarily coplanar with the disc
mid-plane. The accretion discs are assumed to be geometrically thin, and of low
mass relative to the stellar mass so that they are governed by thermal pressure
and viscosity, but not self-gravity. The parameters that we consider in our
models are the ratio of the orbital distance to the disc radius, D/R, the
binary mass ratio, the initial inclination angle between the orbit and disc
planes and the Mach number in the outer parts of the unperturbed disc. For
binary mass ratios of around unity and D/R in the range 3 to 4, we find that
the global evolution of the discs is governed primarily by the value of the
Mach number. For relatively low Mach numbers (i.e. 10 to 20) we find that the
discs develop a mildly warped structure, are tidally truncated, and undergo a
near rigid body precession at a rate which is in close agreement with
analytical arguments. For higher Mach numbers (approx. 30), the evolution is
towards a considerably more warped structure, but the disc none the less
maintains itself as a long-lived, coherent entity. Additionally, it is found
that the inclination angle between the disc and orbital angular momentum
vectors evolves on a longer timescale which is probably the viscous evolution
timescale of the disc. The calculations are relevant to a number of observed
astrophysical phenomena, including the precession of jets associated with young
stars, the high spectral index of some T-Tauri stars, and the light curves of
X-ray binaries such as Hercules X-1 which suggest the presence of precessing
accretion discs.

nearby stellar populations. Gravitational microlensing promises to
revolutionize our understanding of the MF. It is already technologically
feasible to measure the MFs of the Galactic disk and Galactic bulge as
functions of position, although the actual execution of this program requires
aggressive ground-based observations including infrared interferometry, as well
as the launching of a small satellite telescope. Rapid developments in
microlensing, including the new technique of ``pixel lensing'' of unresolved
stars, will allow one to probe the MF and luminosity function of nearby
galaxies. Such observations of M31 are already underway, and pixel-lensing
observations of M87 with the {\it Hubble Space Telescope} would permit
detection of dark intra-cluster objects in Virgo. Microlensing techniques can
also be applied to investigate the star-formation history of the universe and
to search for planets with masses as small as the Earth's. Based on an invited

in determining the dynamical evolution of a star cluster. In addition,
three-body scattering can give rise to many interesting exceptional objects:
merging can produce blue stragglers; exchange can produce binaries containing
millisecond pulsars in environments quite different from those in which the
pulsars were spun up; various types of X-ray binaries can be formed, and their
activity can be either shut off or triggered as a result of triple
interactions.
  To date, all published results on three-body scattering have relied on human
guidance for determining the correct parameter range for the envelope within
which to perform Monte--Carlo scattering experiments. In this paper, we
describe the first fully automatic determination of cross sections and reaction
rates for binary--single-star scattering. Rather than relying on human
inspection of pilot calculations, we have constructed a feedback system that
ensures near-optimal coverage of parameter space while guaranteeing
completeness. We illustrate our approach with a particular example, in which we
describe the results of a three-body encounter between three main-sequence
stars of different masses. We provide total cross sections, as well as
branching ratios for the various different types of two-body mergers,
three-body mergers, and exchanges, both non-resonant and resonant. The

unequal-mass three-body scattering for hard binaries in the point-mass limit.

Spectrometer. For each cluster, we simultaneously fit the spectra from these
three detectors with models incorporating one or more emission components
comprised of either thermal or cooling flow models. Five of the clusters (all
but A2142) are better fit by a multi-component model (a cooling flow plus one
or two thermal components or a two thermal component model) than by isothermal
models. In four of the clusters (A85, A1795, A2147, & A2199), we find evidence
for cool gas outside of the canonical cooling flow region. These latter four
clusters can be characterized by three temperature components: a temperature
inversion in the central region, a hotter region with an emission-weighted
temperature which is higher than that of an isothermal model fit to the entire
cluster, and a cooler region with an emission-weighted temperature of ~1 keV.
The cool component outside the cooling flow region has a large minimum emission
measure which we attribute, in part, to diffuse cool gas in the outer cluster
atmosphere. If at least some of the cool exterior gas is virialized, this would
imply a radially decreasing temperature profile. Together with the density
profiles we have found, this leads to a baryon fraction in gas which increases
with radius and is larger than that for an isothermal cluster atmosphere.
Consequently, if clusters of galaxies trace the mass distribution in the

  MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/282.3.767",,"astro-ph",,"  We present an expression for the nonlinear evolution of the cosmological
power spectrum based on following Lagrangian trajectories. This is simplified
using the Zel'dovich approximation to trace particle displacements, assuming
Gaussian initial conditions. The model is found to exhibit the transfer of
power from large to small scales expected in self- gravitating fields. We have
extended this analysis into redshift-space and found a solution for the
nonlinear, anisotropic redshift-space power spectrum in the limit of
plane--parallel redshift distortions. The quadrupole-to- monopole ratio is
calculated for the case of power-law initial spectra. We find that the shape of
this ratio depends on the shape of the initial spectrum, but when scaled to
linear theory depends only weakly on the redshift-space distortion parameter,
$\beta$. The point of zero-crossing of the quadrupole, $k_0$, is found to obey
a scaling relation. This model is found to be in agreement with $N$-body
simulations on scales down to the zero-crossing of the quadrupole, although the
wavenumber at zero-crossing is underestimated. These results are applied to the
quadrupole--monopole ratio found in the merged QDOT+1.2 Jy IRAS redshift
survey. We have estimated that the distortion parameter is constrained to be
$\beta>0.5$ at the $95 \%$ level. The local primordial spectral slope is not
well constrained, but analysis suggests $n \approx -2$ in the translinear
regime. The zero-crossing scale of the quadrupole is $k_0=0.5 \pm 0.1 h/Mpc$
and from this we infer the amplitude of clustering is $\sigma_8=0.7 \pm 0.05$.
We suggest that the success of this model is due to nonlinear redshift--space
effects arising from infall onto caustics and is not dominated by virialised
cluster cores.

sequence of violations being DEC, WEC, and (NEC+SEC). Furthermore the ANEC is
violated for *some* of the null geodesics trapped in this region. Having
established the basic machinery in this paper, the Boulware vacuum will be
treated in a companion paper, while other exensions should be straightforward.

  heading",,,"NEIP-95-015","hep-th hep-ph",,"  I outline various derivations of the non-Abelian Kubo equation, which governs
the response of a quark-gluon plasma to hard thermal perturbations. In the
static case, it is proven that gauge theories do not support hard thermal
solitons. Explicit solutions are constructed within an SU(2) Ansatz and they
are shown to support the general result. The time-dependent problem, i.e.,
non-Abelian plasma waves, has not been completely solved. We express and
motivate the hope that the intimate relations linking the gauge-invariance
condition for hard thermal loops to the equation of motion for T=0, topological
Chern-Simons theory may yield new insight into this field.

interactions we investigate self-interacting scalar, pseudoscalar and vector
meson fields and their impact for NN forces. We parametrize the corresponding
nonlinear field equations and get analytic wavelike solutions. A probability
amplitude for the propagation of particle states is calculated and applied in
the framework of a boson-exchange NN potential. Using a proper normalization of
the meson fields makes all self-scattering amplitudes finite. The same
normalization is able to substitute for the phenomenological form factors used
in conventional boson exchange potentials and thus yields an phenomenological
understanding of this part of the NN interaction. We find an empirical scaling
law which relates the meson self-interaction couplings to the pion mass and
self-interaction coupling constant. Our model yields np phase shifts comparable
to the Bonn B potential results and deuteron properties, in excellent agreement
with experimental data.

interaction on $M1$ excitation rates and $B(E2)'s$ are studied on nuclei in the
$0p$ and $1s-0d$ shells. Not only the total $M1$ but also the spin and orbital
parts separately are studied. The single-particle energies are first calculated
with the same interaction that is used between the valence nucleons. Later this
stringent condition is relaxed somewhat and the $1s$ level is raised relative
to $0d$. For nuclei up to $^{28}Si$, much better results i.e stronger $B(M1)$
rates are obtained by increasing the strength of the spin-orbit interaction
relative to the free value. This is probably also true for $^{32}S$, but
$^{36}Ar$ presents some difficulties. The effects of weakening the tensor
interaction are also studied. On a more subtle level, the optimum spin-orbit
interaction in the lower half of the $s-d$ shell, as far as $M1$ excitations
are concerned, is substantially larger than the difference
$E(J=3/2^+)_1-E(J=5/2^+)_1=5.2~MeV$ in $^{17}O$. A larger spin-orbit splitting
is also needed to destroy the triaxiality in $^{22}Ne$. Also studied are how
much $M1$ orbital and spin strength lies in an observable region and how much
is buried in the grass at higher energies. It is noted that for many nuclei the
sum $B(M1)_{orbital}+B(M1)_{spin}$ is very close to $B(M1)_{total}$, indicating
that the summed cross terms are very small.
