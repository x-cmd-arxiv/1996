combining HI and CO position-velocity diagrams. We show that inner rotation
curves have a steep increase within the central few hundred-pc region. The
inner behavior of rotation can be fitted by the Miyamoto-Nagai potential, only
if a central mass component with scale radius of 100 -- 200 pc and a mass of
$\sim 3-5\times 10^{9}\Msun$ is assumed in addition to the usual bulge. This
implies that the central $\sim 100$-pc region has a stellar mass density
  as high as several hundred $\Msun{\rm pc}^{-3}$, orders-of-magnitudes higher
than that for a single bulge and disk (several $\Msun {\rm pc}^{-3}$). Such a
concentric multi-component structure within a bulge (``bulge in bulge'') may
have crucial implication for the dynamical evolution of the central regions of
galaxies. Since the molecular gas distribution is closely correlated with
optical disk, CO line can be used for the line width-luminosity (Tully Fisher)
relation in addition to (instead of) the HI line. We show that the CO-line

$\sim100$ Mpc appear to be controversial, while the observations made at high
redshift seem to provide a relatively low value. On the other hand, the Hubble
expansion is driven by the matter content of the universe. The dynamical
analysis on scale of a few $\sim10$ Mpc indicates that the matter density
$\Omega_0$ is only $\sim0.2$--$0.3$, which is significantly smaller than
$\Omega_0=1$ predicted in the standard inflation model. This might support the
tendency of a decreasing Hubble constant towards distance. In this paper, we
discuss the influence of a possible variant Hubble constant on two fundamental
relations in astronomy: the magnitude-redshift ($m$--$z$) and the
number-magnitude relations. Using a distant type Ia supernova at $z=0.458$, we
show that the deceleration parameter $q_0$ or $\Omega_0$ cannot be determined
from the $m$--$z$ relation at moderate/high redshift unless the variation of
the Hubble constant is {\it a priori} measured. It is further demonstrated that
the number density of distant sources would be underestimated when their local
calibration is employed, which may partially account for the number excess of
the faint blue galaxies observed at moderate/high redshift.

field was imaged with the HST WFPC2 as part of the Medium Deep Survey project.
The luminosity function (LF) continually rises in the domain $5 < M_I < 9$ with
a slope $\Delta log \Phi (M) / \Delta M \sim 0.15$ and then drops off sharply.
We compare our LF with that derived by De Marchi \& Paresce for a neighbouring
HST field. The two independent LFs are very similar in the entire range of
luminosities probed ($M_I < 10$). Comparisons are also made to other HST LFs
derived by several authors for different clusters in the Galaxy. We use the KS
test to assess the significance of the differences found. The LFs obtained with
HST are consistent with being derived from the same population down to $M_I
\sim 9.0$. Beyond that, statistically significant variations arise. Globular
cluster LFs also differ according to the prominence of a plateau in the bright
end ($5 < M_I < 6.5$). Mass functions are sensitive to the mass-luminosity
relation. Different approaches to deriving the 47 Tuc mass function from its LF
lead to markedly different results at the low mass end. For $M > 0.4 M_\odot$,
the 47 Tuc mass function is significantly different from that of \wcen. The
calibrated HST $M_V(V-I)$ colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) show a trend with
metallicity in the sense of metal richer systems having redder CMDs for a fixed
absolute magnitude. The main-sequence becomes shallower with increasing
metallicity. For metal-rich systems, the CMDs derived from HST are in general
agreement with previous ground-based studies. However, the CMDs of metal poor

sequence and for the dependence of these properties on the environment, in an
absolute magnitude complete sample of 187 galaxies in the Coma cluster. The
morphological type of all galaxies was determined from our own high resolution
data. We also compared this sample with other published complete samples of
galaxies in the Perseus and Virgo clusters and in the local field. Ellipticals
and lenticulars are highly homogeneous in all their internal photometric
properties. These galaxies are well described just by their morphological type
and luminosity, regardless of the environment. On the other hand, some of the
external properties of these galaxies and of their subclasses differ markedly.
Then, for early-type galaxies, the environment determines the space density of
each type but not the internal properties of the type, which are the same in
all environments. Spirals form a heterogeneous class of objects whose
photometric properties depend on one extra parameter related to the
environment. The spatial distribution of spirals as a whole class is uniform.
For spirals, therefore, the environment does not determine the space density,
which is the same in all environments, but strongly affects the internal galaxy
properties. The galaxies in Coma, as in Perseus, are segregated primarily with
respect to the supercluster main direction, thus providing a new interpretation
of the morphology-radius and morphology-density relations.

where a mixed fundamental SU(2) and SO(3)-invariant gauge group is used: the
(second order) finite temperature phase transition becomes involved with first
order effects with increased SO(3) coupling, and this first order effect has a
noticeable coupling dependence for small lattices. We produce evidence that the
first order transition is essentially bulk in nature as generally believed, and
that the finite temperature effects start to separate out from the lower end of
the bulk effects for a lattice of 8 sites in the finite temperature direction.
We strengthen our picture of the first order effects as artefacts by using an
improved action: this shifts the end point of the first order line away from
the fundamental SU(2) axis.

model describes a lattice of atoms with a given concentration interacting by
Morse-type forces, the lattice being subjected to a two-dimensional substrate
potential which is periodic in one direction and nonconvex (Morse) in the
transverse direction. The results are used to describe the complicated
exchange-mediated diffusion mechanism recently observed in MD simulations [J.E.

a system of weakly interacting quasiparticles (kinks). Model parameters are
chosen close to those for {\bf K}-{\bf W}(112) adsorption system.

thus giving a geometric content to the notion of triangularity (or
autoquasitriangularity) for quantum groups.

motion of an ion in a two-dimensional trap. In our scheme, the trapped ion is
excited bichromatically by three laser beams along different directions in the
X-Y plane of the ion trap. We show that if the initial vibrational state is
given by a two-mode Fock state, the final steady state, indicated by the
extinction of the fluorescence emitted by the ion, is a pure state. The
motional state of the ion in the equilibrium realizes that of the
highly-correlated pair coherent state.
