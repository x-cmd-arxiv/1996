Mpc. In conjunction with the Coma velocity and the well-established Coma/Virgo
distance ratio, this yields a Hubble paprameter Ho = 81 +/- 8 km/s/Mpc. By
combining this value with an age of the Universe of at least 16.8 +/- 2.1 Gyr,
that is derived from the metal-poor globular cluster M92, one obtains
f(Omega,Lambda) > 1.39 +/- 0.22. This value is only marginally consisitent with
an Einstein-de Sitter universe with Omega=0 and Lambda=0, which has f=1. An
Einstein-de Sitter universe with Omega=1 and Lambda=0, for which f=2/3, appears
to be excluded at the 3-sigma level. It is shown that some small recent values
of Ho resulted from the intrinsic dispersion in the linear diameters of
galaxies, and from the fact that well-observed supernovae of Type Ia exhibit a
luminosity range of ~20 at maximum light.

(Omega_M,Omega_Lambda)=(1,0), (0.2,0) and (0.2,0.8) are described. If the
evolution of xi is parameterized by xi(r,z)=(1+z)^{-(3+eps)}xi(r,0), where
xi(r,0)=(r/r_0)^{-gamma}, then eps(mass) ranges from 1.04 +/- 0.09 for (1,0) to

with a mean overdensity of about 2000 were used to compute the halo two-point
correlation function tested with two different group finding algorithms: the
friends of friends and the spherical overdensity algorithm. It is certainly
believed that the rate of growth of this xihh will give a good estimate of the
evolution of the galaxy two-point correlation function, at least from z ~ 1 to

halo distribution is measured and compared with the evolution predicted by the
Cosmic Virial Theorem (CVT). According to the CVT, sigma(r,z)^2 ~ G Q rho(z)

helium and iron atmospheres in a wide domain of effective temperatures and
gravitational accelerations expected for neutron stars. The iron atmospheres
are computed with the opacities and equations of state from the OPAL opacity
library. We show that the model atmosphere spectra are substantially different
from the blackbody spectra. For light element atmospheres, the flux is greater
than the blackbody flux, and the spectrum is harder, at high photon energies,
whereas at low energies the spectral flux follows the Rayleigh-Jeans law with a
(surface) temperature lower than the effective temperature. The spectra of iron
atmospheres display prominent spectral features in the soft X-ray range. The
emergent specific intensity is anisotropic, with the anisotropy depending on
energy. These properties of the atmospheric radiation should be taken into
account for the proper interpretation of the thermal component of the neutron
star radiation detectable at X-ray through UV energies. In particular, fitting
of the thermal component with the blackbody model may result in substantially
incorrect parameters of the radiating regions. We discuss an application of our
atmosphere models to the nearby millisecond pulsar PSR J0437-4715.
