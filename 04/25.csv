locus of a real algebraic curve and obtain what we call a floppy curve. A
floppy curve is a certain kind of singular surface in CP(2), more general than
the complex locus of a real nodal curve. We derive analogs for floppy curves of
known restrictions on real nodal curves. In particular we derive analogs of
Fielder's congruence for certain nonsingular curves and Viro's inequalities for
nodal curves which generalize those of Arnold and Petrovskii for nonsingular
curves. We also obtain a determinant condition for certain curves which are
extremal with respect to some of these equalities. One may prohibit certain
schemes for real algebraic curves by prohibiting the floppy curves which result
from singular ambient surgery. In this way, we give a new proof of Shustin's
prohibition of the scheme $1<2\coprod 1<18>>$ for a real algebraic curve of
degree eight.

to estimate the luminosity, distance, and total line-of-sight extinction of
Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). The empirical correlation between the MLCS and the
luminosity is derived from a ``training set'' of nine SN Ia light curves with
independent distance and reddening estimates. We find that intrinsically dim SN
Ia are redder and have faster light curves than the bright ones which are slow
and blue. By thirty-five days after maximum the intrinsic color variations
become negligable. A formal treatment of extinction employing Bayes' theorem is
used to estimate the best value and its uncertainty. Applying MLCS to both
light curves and to color curves provides enough information to determine which
supernovae are dim because they are distant, which are intrinsically dim, and
which are dim because of extinction by dust. The precision of the MLCS
distances is examined by constructing a Hubble diagram with an independent set
of twenty SN Ia's. The dispersion of 0.12 mag indicates a typical distance
accuracy of 5 % for a single object, and the intercept yields a Hubble constant
on the Cepheid distance scale (Sandage et al 1994, 1996) of H_0=65 \pm 3
(statistical) km/s/Mpc ( \pm 6 total error). The slope of 0.2010 pm 0.0035 mag

of a distortion to the standard ML light curve arising from the Earth's orbital
motion. In most cases, the resolution in current ML surveys is not accurate
enough to observe this effect, but parallax could conceivably be detected with
frequent followup observations of ML events in progress. We calculate the
expected fraction of events where parallax distortions will be detected by such
observations, adopting Galactic models consistent with the observed ML
timescale ($t_0$) distributions. We study the dependence of the rates for
parallax-shifted events on the sampling frequency and on the photometric
precision. For example, we find that for hourly observations with typical
photometric errors of 0.01 mag, 6\% of events where the lens is in the bulge,
and 31\% of events where the lens is in the disk, (or $\approx 10$\% of events
overall) will give rise to a measurable parallax shift at the 95\% confidence
level. These fractions may be increased by improved photometric accuracy and
increased sampling frequency. Parallax measurements yield the reduced
transverse speed, $\tilde{v}$, which gives both the relative transverse speed
and lens mass as functions of distance. We give examples of the accuracies with
which $\tilde{v}$ may be measured in typical parallax events. Using only the 3
standard ML parameters to fit ML light curves which may be shape-distorted by
parallax or blending, can result in incorrect inferred values for these
quantities. We find that the inferred timescales from such fits tend to shift
the event duration distribution by $\approx 10$\% towards shorter $t_0$ for
events with disk lenses, but do not affect bulge lenses. In both cases, the
impact-parameter distribution is depressed slightly at the low and high ends.

substantially increase the number of extragalactic globular cluster systems

trends are also present. Firstly, globular cluster colors are bluer (more metal
poor by ~ 0.5 dex) than the underlying galaxy starlight at any given

the case of atomic nuclei, exemplified by 12C and 40Ca, the standard
liquid-drop results are reproduced at low temperatures and a phase
transformation to a fragment gas occurs as the temperature is raised. The
treatment can be extended to dynamical scenarios by means of a Langevin force
emulating the transitions between the wave packets. The general form of the
associated transport coefficients is derived and it is shown that the
appropriate microcanonical equilibrium distribution is achieved in the course
of the time evolution. Finally, invoking Fermi's golden rule, we derive
specific expressions for the transport coefficients and verify that they
satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

star matter with electrons and muons using a relativistic
Dirac--Brueckner--Hartree--Fock approach, starting with modern meson--exchange
models for the nucleon--nucleon interaction. Results are given for
superconducting $^1S_0$ protons and $^3P_2$ and $^1D_2$ neutron superfluids. A
comparison is made with recent non--relativistic calculations and the
implications for neutron star cooling are discussed.

quantum state storage). The method is based on the operation of projection into
$\cal SYM$, the symmetric subspace of the full state space of $R$ redundant
copies of the computer. We describe an efficient algorithm and quantum network
effecting $\cal SYM$--projection and discuss the stabilising effect of the
proposed method in the context of unitary errors generated by hardware
imprecision, and nonunitary errors arising from external environmental
interaction. Finally, limitations of the method are discussed.

spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg XXZ spin chain in a magnetic field. We show that
for a magnetic field close to the critical field $h_c$ (for the critical
magnetic field the ground state is ferromagnetic) certain correlation functions
can be expressed in terms of the solution of the Painlev\'e V transcendent.
This establishes a relation between solutions of Painlev\'e differential
equations and quantum correlation functions in models of {\sl interacting}
fermions. Painlev\'e transcendents were known to describe correlation functions
in models with free fermionic spectra.
