suggests that the CR sources are much more concentrated towards the

His approach relies on calculations of the peak absolute magnitudes and
broad--band colors for SN Ia explosion models. It does not require any
corrections for extinction by interstellar dust, and no SNe Ia are excluded on
grounds of peculiarity. Within the last few years distances have been
determined to the parent galaxies of six SNe Ia by means of Cepheid variables.
Cepheid--based distances also have become available for three other SNe Ia if
one is willing to use the distance to a galaxy in the same group in lieu of the
distance to the parent galaxy itself. Here we determine the value of H_0 in a
way that is analogous to that of van den Bergh, but now using Cepheid--based
distances instead of calculated light curves. We obtain H_0 = 55 km/s/Mpc. This
value, with Lambda=0 and Omega=1, corresponds to a cosmic expansion time of 12
Gyr, which is consistent with several recent determinations of the ages of

been investigated using near-infrared and optical broadband surface photometry
of 86 face-on spiral galaxies. Colors of galaxies correlate with the
azimuthally averaged local surface brightness both within and among galaxies,
with the lower surface brightness regions being bluer. The colors formed from
different passband combinations correlate strongly indicating that they
probably arise from the same physical process.
  A 3D radiative transfer model was developed to calculate the effect of dust
absorption and scattering on the luminosity and color profiles of galaxies.
Stellar synthesis models were used to investigate the effects of the star
formation history and the metallicity on the broadband color profiles.
Combining all optical and near-infrared data shows that the color gradients in
this sample of face-on galaxies are best explained by a combined stellar age
and metallicity gradient across the disk, with the outer regions being on
average younger and of lower metallicity. Dust reddening probably plays only a
minor role, as the dust models cannot produce reddening profiles that are
compatible with the observations.
  The observed color differences implicate substantial M/L_lambda differences,
both within galaxies and among galaxies. The variations are such that the
``missing light'' problem derived from rotation fitting becomes even worse.
Late-type galaxies (T>=6) have lower metallicities and are often of younger
average age than earlier types and have therefore an entirely different
M/L_\lambda in most passbands. The near-infrared passbands are recommended for
studies where the M/L_\lambda ratios should not vary too much.

to evaluate the form factors at the same value of $q^2$, even though the
allowed kinematic ranges for charm and bottom decays are very different. Also,
at this kinematic point the decay is given in terms of only one form factor
$A_{0}(0)$. For the ratio of the decay rates given by the E653 collaboration we
show that the determination of the ratio of the Cabibbo--Kobayashi--Maskawa
(CKM) matrix elements is consistent with that obtained from the unitarity
constraint. At present, though, the unitarity method still has greater
accuracy. Since comparisons of the semileptonic decays into $\rho$ and either
electrons or muons will be available soon from the E791 Fermilab experiment, we
also look at the massive muon case. We show that for a range of $q^2$ the
$SU(3)_F$ symmetry breaking is small even though the contributions of the
various helicity amplitudes becomes more complicated. For $B$ decays, the decay
$B \rightarrow K^{*} \ell \bar{\ell}$ at $q^2=0$ involves an extra form factor
coming from the photon contribution and so is not amenable to the same kind of
analysis, leaving only the decay $B \rightarrow K^{*}\nu \bar{\nu}$ as a
possibility. As the mass of the decaying particle increases we note that the
$SU(3)$ symmetry becomes badly broken at $q^2=0$.

manifold of $\C^{n}$ seems to play a merely technical role, it turns out to be
a rather deep and fruitful notion for the extendability of CR functions defined
on the manifold.
  In this paper we give a new geometric description of defect, drawing
attention to the behaviour of the interior points of the disc by infinitesimal
perturbations. For hypersurfaces a stronger result holds because these
perturbations describe a complex vector space of $\C^{n}$.
  For a big analytic disc the defect does not need to be smaller than the
codimension of the manifold. Indeed we show by an example that it can be
arbitrarily large independently of the codimension of the manifold.
Nevertheless we also prove that the defect is always finite. In the case of a
hypersurface we give a geometric upper bound for the defect.

  orbital 1$^+$ excitations","Latex, 28 pages, 12 postscript figures included using uufiles","Nucl. Phys. A 598 (1996) 82","10.1016/0375-9474(95)00499-8",,"nucl-th",,"  The main features of the $(e,e^{\prime})$ cross sections of low-lying orbital
excitations with $K^{\pi} = 1^+$ in heavy deformed nuclei are studied in RPA on
the example of $^{156}$Gd. The dependence of the DWBA E2 and M1 cross sections
on the scattering angle $0^{\circ} < \theta < 180 ^{\circ}$ and incident
electron energy $E_i < 210$ MeV is analyzed in PWBA. The cross section is
larger for M1 than for E2 transitions at any angle if $E_i < 30$ MeV. The
longitudinal (Coulomb) C2 excitation dominates the E2 response for $5^{\circ} <
\theta < 170 ^{\circ}$. Only transverse M1 and E2 excitations compete for
$\theta > 175 ^{\circ}$ and the former one is dominant for $q < 1.2$ fm$^{-1}$.
The M1 response is almost purely orbital up to $q = 1.4$ fm$^{-1}$ even in
backward scattering. Qualitative PWBA estimates based on the $q$-dependence of
the form factors alone are not able to predict some important features of the
$(e,e^{\prime})$ cross sections stemming from the strong magnetic and orbital
character of the studied 1$^+$ excitations. The expectation for M1 over E2
dominance in backward scattering should not be extended to higher momentum
transfers and incident energies.

  relative unavailability of the journal in which it appears","Open Systems & Information Dynamics 3 (1995) 1",,,"quant-ph",,"  We present mathematical techniques for addressing two closely related
questions in quantum communication theory. In particular, we give a
statistically motivated derivation of the Bures-Uhlmann measure of
distinguishability for density operators, and we present a simplified proof of
the Holevo upper bound to the mutual information of quantum communication
channels. Both derivations give rise to novel quantum measurements.

nonlinear lattices including FPU lattices using non-integrability preserving
transformation.
