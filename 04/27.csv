X-ray sources with luminosities (1--2)\times 10^{40} erg/s are clearly
identified with NGC 1672. The strongest X-ray source lies at the nucleus, and
the other two lie near the ends of the prominent bar, locations that are also
bright in H-alpha and near-infrared images. The nuclear source is resolved by
the HRI on about the scale of the recently identified nuclear ring, and one of
the sources at the ends of the bar is also probably resolved. The X-ray
spectrum of the nuclear source is quite soft, having a Raymond--Smith plasma
temperature of about 0.7 keV and little evidence for intrinsic absorption. The
ROSAT band X-ray flux of the nuclear source appears to be dominated not by
X-ray binary emission but rather by diffuse gas emission. While the properties
of the nuclear source are generally supportive of a superbubble interpretation,
its large density and emission measure stretch the limits that can be
comfortably accommodated by such models. We do not detect direct emission from
the putative Seyfert nucleus, although an alternative model for the nuclear
source is thermal emission from gas that is photoionized by a hidden Seyfert
nucleus. The spectra of the other two X-ray sources are harder than that of the
nuclear source, and superbubble models for them have the same strengths and
weaknesses.

very light. $H^+$--$h^0$ splitting accounts for $\delta\rho$, while light $h^0$
induce fast $t\to c + h^0$ decay and hides the actual top quark at the

top production (and toponium!). At Tevatron, one should search for exotic decay
modes such as $Q\to Z + X$ or $Q\to H + X$, or measure the BR for the standard
$bW$ mode. Light top search should also be renewed.

definition to four others: The existence of a left inverse of the interaction,
an explicit representation of the error syndrome using tensor products, perfect
recovery of the completely entangled state, and an information theoretic
identity. Two notions of fidelity and error for imperfect recovery are
introduced, one for pure and the other for entangled states. The latter is more
appropriate when using codes in a quantum memory or in applications of quantum
teleportation to communication. We show that the error for entangled states is
bounded linearly by the error for pure states. A formal definition of
independent interactions for qubits is given. This leads to lower bounds on the
number of qubits required to correct $e$ errors and a formal proof that the
classical bounds on the probability of error of $e$-error-correcting codes
applies to $e$-error-correcting quantum codes, provided that the interaction is
dominated by an identity component.
