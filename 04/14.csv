symmetry and logarithmic level repulsion are studied both in presence and
absence of hard edge in their energy spectra. Employing a theory of polynomials
orthogonal with respect to exponential weights we calculate with asymptotic
accuracy the two-point kernel over all distance scale, and show that in the
limit of large dimensions of random matrices the properly rescaled local
eigenvalue correlations are independent of level confinement while global
smoothed connected correlations depend on confinement potential only through
the endpoints of spectrum. We also obtain exact expressions for density of
levels, one- and two-point Green's functions, and prove that new universal
local relationship exists for suitably normalized and rescaled connected
two-point Green's function. Connection between structure of Szeg\""o function
entering strong polynomial asymptotics and mean-field equation is traced.

the SU(2)+Higgs model with 3d lattice results for the phase transition in the
corresponding dimensionally reduced effective theory. While the large errorbars
and the lack of a relation of the 4d lattice gauge coupling to continuum
physics prevent rigorous conclusions, the results are nevertheless compatible.
This provides a direct non-perturbative check of dimensional reduction in the
present context.

singlet axial constant associated with $\eta'$ meson as well as an axial
constant associated with heavy quarks.

to derive a class of solutions which describes a point center system with

discontinuously on the ball in dimension three or higher, uniformly
quasiconformal groups acting discontinuously on the ball in dimension three or

The expansion is organized according to the independent group structures that

the group factors are chosen in a certain way that we call canonical. This
enables us to show that the logarithm of a polinomial knot invariant can be
written in terms of primitive Vassiliev invariants only.
