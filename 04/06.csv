projected on the source plane, $\hat{r}_{\rm e}$ and $\hat{v}$, can be
determined from the light curve of a binary-source event, followed by the
spectroscopic determination of the orbital elements of the source stars. The
determination makes use of the same principle that allows one to measure the
Einstein ring radii from finite-source effects. For the case when the orbital
period of the source stars is much longer than the Einstein time scale, $P\gg
t_{\rm e}$, there exists a single two-fold degeneracy in determining
$\hat{r}_{\rm e}$. However, when $P \lesssim t_{\rm e}$ the degeneracy can
often be broken by making use of the binary-source system's orbital motion.
%Once $\hat{r}_{\rm e}$, and thus $\hat{v}$ are determined, one can
%distinguish self-lensing events in the Large Magellanic Cloud %from Galactic
halo events. For an identifiable 8\% of all lensing events seen toward the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), one can unambiguously determine whether the
lenses are Galactic, or whether they lie in the LMC itself. The required
observations can be made after the event is over and could be carried out for
the $\sim 8$ events seen by Alcock et al.\ and Aubourg et al.. In addition, we
propose to include eclipsing binaries as sources for gravitational lensing
experiments.

galaxies (bulge/total luminosity $B/T>0.6$) in 3 fields of the Canadian Network

spectroscopically confirmed members of clusters at $z=0.23$ (45 galaxies),
$0.43$ (22), and $0.55$ (16) or field galaxies in the same redshift range. An
additional 51 early-type galaxies in the rich cluster Abell 2256 at $z=0.06$
were analysed with the same technique. The resulting structural and surface
brightness measurements show that, in the plane of absolute magnitude
$M_{AB}(B)$ versus $\log R_e$ (half-light radius), the locus of cluster
ellipticals shifts monotonically with redshift so that at redshifts of (0.23,
0.43, 0.55), galaxies of a given size are more luminous by ($-0.25\pm
0.10,-0.55\pm 0.12,-0.74\pm 0.21$) magnitudes with respect to the same relation
measured at $z=0.06$ (adopting $q_\circ=0.5$). There is no evidence that
early-type galaxies in the field evolve differently from those in clusters. If
dynamical processes do not substantially modify the size-luminosity relation
for early-type galaxies over the observed redshift range, then these galaxies
have undergone significant luminosity evolution over the past half of the age
of the universe. The amount of brightening is consistent with passive evolution
models of old, single-burst stellar populations.

  at http://rossky-centris.cm.utexas.edu",,,,"chem-ph cond-mat physics.chem-ph",,"  Non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations are used to analyze the role of
different solvent degrees of freedom in the non-radiative relaxation of the
first excited state of the hydrated electron. The relaxation occurs through a
multi-mode coupling between the adiabatic electronic states. The process cannot
be described by a single mode promotion model frequently used in the ``large
molecule'' limit of gas phase theories. Solvent librations and vibrations, and
the H2O asymmetric stretch in particular, are found to be the most effective
promotors of the electronic transition. Dissipation of the released energy to
the solvent proceeds on two time scales: a fast 10-20 fs heating of the first
solvation shell, where most of the energy is accepted by the librational
degrees of freedom, and a several hundred femtosecond global reconstruction of
t he solvent as the first shell transfers its excess energy to the rest of the
molecules. The implications of our use of a semiclassical approximation as the
criterion for good promoting and accepting modes are discussed.

proved that, if at a given $Q_0^2$ large enough for perturbative QCD to be

for all larger $Q^2$ one has $$F_2(x,Q^2)\simeq

$$R(x,Q^2)=\frac{r_0\alpha_s(Q^2)}{\pi},$$ with $D_{11},\,d_+,\,B_G,\,r_0$
calculable in terms of $B_S,\,\lambda$. Moreover, it was suggested that the
``hard"" part of the scattering cross section for real photons (Compton
scattering) obeys a similar law, so that $$\sigma_{\gamma p}\simeq B_{\gamma
p}s^{\lambda}+A_{\gamma p}\hat{\sigma}^P,$$ with a value of $\lambda$
comparable to that in the expression for the structure functions, and where
$\hat{\sigma}^P\sim\log^2s$ is a universal, Pomeron-type cross section, and
$A_{\gamma p},\, B_{\gamma p}$ are constants. In the present paper it is shown
that the recent HERA measurements may be described by these formulas, with a
chi-sqared/d.o.f. substantially less than unity, and with values of the
parameters compatible with those of the old fits of the '80s. Moreover, further
discussions are presented both on the low $Q^2$ limit, and the transition
between Compton and deep inelastic scattering, in particular in connection with
possible saturation of the coupling constant $\alpha_s(Q^2)$ at small $Q^2$;
and on the ultra high energy limit, and how one might test the so-called BFKL
conjecture, $$\lim_{x\rightarrow 0\atop Q^2\rightarrow \infty}F_2(x,Q^2)\sim
