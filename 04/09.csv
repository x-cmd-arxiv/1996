sequences of compact strange-matter stars with nuclear crusts, which range from
strange stars to strange dwarfs. In contrast to their non-strange counterparts,
--neutron stars and white dwarfs--, their properties are determined by two
(rather than one) parameters, the central star density and the density at the
base of the nuclear crust. This leads to stellar strange-matter configurations
whose properties are much more complex than those of the conventional sequence.
As an example, two generically different categories of stable strange dwarfs
are found, which could be the observed white dwarfs. Furthermore we find very
low-mass strange stellar objects, with masses as small as those of Jupiter or
even lighter planets. Such objects, if abundant enough in our Galaxy, should be
seen by the presently performed gravitational microlensing searches. Further
aspects studied in this paper concern the limiting rotational periods and the
cooling behavior of neutron stars and their strange counterparts.

unbiased counts-in-cells analysis finds a clustering strength in broad

dark matter model. We combine our data with those from the QDOT and 1.2 Jy

compare the data with the power spectrum derived from a mixed dark matter
universe. Direct comparison of the clustering strength seen in the IRAS samples
with that seen in the APM-Stromlo survey suggests b_O/b_I=1.20+/-0.05 assuming
a linear, scale independent biasing. We also perform a cell by cell comparison
of our FSS-z sample with galaxies from the first CfA slice, testing the
viability of a linear-biasing scheme linking the two. We are able to rule out
models in which the FSS-z galaxies identically trace the CfA galaxies on scales
5-20h^{-1}Mpc. On scales of 5 and 10h^{-1}Mpc no linear-biasing model can be
found relating the two samples. We argue that this result is expected since the
CfA sample includes more elliptical galaxies which have different clustering
properties from spirals. On scales of 20h^{-1}Mpc no linear-biasing model with
b_O/b_I < 1.70 is acceptable. When comparing the FSS-z galaxies to the CfA
spirals, however, the two populations trace the same structures within our
uncertainties.

perturbation theory, a linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity
is obtained, and the leading corrections to the impurity specific heat are

T$ to zero, first, and second order, and corrections of $\ln^2 T$ to second

forms at the Fermi level. When the perturbation theory is extended to third
order logarithmic divergences are found in the vertex function
$\Gamma_{0,1,2,3}(0,0,0,0)$. Multiplicative renormalization-group method is

$M$ are the masses of a particle and of a black hole, respectively. The inverse
of the Lyapunov exponent in the most chaotic case is about three orbital
periods, which suggests that chaos of a spinning particle may become important
in some relativistic astrophysical phenomena. The ``effective potential""
analysis enables us to classify the particle orbits into four types as follows.
When the total angular momentum $J$ is large, some orbits are bounded and the
``effective potential""s are classified into two types: (B1) one saddle point
(unstable circular orbit) and one minimal point (stable circular orbit) on the
equatorial plane exist for small spin; and (B2) two saddle points bifurcate
from the equatorial plane and one minimal point remains on the equatorial plane
for large spin. When $J$ is small, no bound orbits exist and the potentials are
classified into another two types: (U1) no extremal point is found for small
spin; and (U2) one saddle point appears on the equatorial plane, which is
unstable in the direction perpendicular to the equatorial plane, for large
spin. The types (B1) and (U1) are the same as those for a spinless particle,
but the potentials (B2) and (U2) are new types caused by spin-orbit coupling.
The chaotic behavior is found only in the type (B2) potential. The

remain very dilute due to the growth of the horizon area which they claim grows
more rapidly than the average number of open strings. Such a picture of a
dilute weakly coupled string system conflicts with the picture of a dense
string-soup that saturates the bound of one string per planck area. A more
careful analysis shows that Callan and Maldacena were not fully consistent in
their estimates. In the form that their model was studied it can not be used to
extrapolate to large mass without being in conflict with the Hawking Bekenstein

show that under natural assumptions about analytic properties of the operators
${\bf Q}(\lambda)$ as the functions of $\lambda$ the Baxter's relation allows
one to derive the nonlinear integral equations of Destri-de Vega (DDV)\ \dVega\

obtain the asymptotic expansions of the ${\bf Q}$ - operators at large
