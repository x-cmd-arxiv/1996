small particles number and it very quick relaxed to quasiequilibrium state at
the Planck parameters. The classic cosmological solution for this Universe,
with the calculation of its ability to be undergo to the second order
relativistic phase transition (RPT), has two branches divided by gap. On one
from these branches near to ""Nothing"" state the second order RPT isn't possible
at the GUT scale. Other branch is thermodynamically instable. The quantum
process of tunneling between the cosmological solution branches and kinetics of
the second order RPT after tunneling are investigated by numerical methods.
Other quantum geometrodynamics process (the bounce from singularity) is taken
into consideration also. It is shown that discussed phenomenon with the
calculation of all RPT from the GUT scale to the Salam-Weinberg scale gives the
new cosmological scenarios of the macroscopic Universe origin with observable

apparent deficiency in soft X-ray surface brightness observed at the outer

to place a lower limit on the intensity of this cosmologically important

confidence lower limit was derived to be $32 keV cm^{-2} s^{-1} keV^{-1}$ at
1/4 keV. This was obtained by assuming that there is no unresolved 1/4 keV
X-ray emission from the outer region of the galaxy which may otherwise
partially fill in the shadow: any such emission, or any unresolved structure in
the absorbing gas, would imply a larger value. In the deepest exposure to date
in this energy range, Hasinger et al. (1993) resolved about $30 keV cm^{-2}
s^{-1} keV^{-1}$ at 1/4 keV into discrete sources; our current limit is
therefore consistent with an extragalactic origin for all of these sources. Our

derived from the ROSAT PSPC detection of soft X-ray shadows cast by
high-latitude clouds in Ursa Major, $\simeq 65 keV cm^{-2} s^{-1} keV^{-1}$ at

unavoidable contamination of disk starlight has been carefully minimized and
set to $\sim$ 1/7 of the total stellar light. The sample covers a wide range in
bulge luminosity and morphology. The Mg$_2$ index shows a tight correlation
with the bulge intrinsic luminosity, similar - and extended at fainter
magnitudes - to the relationship known for ellipticals. Other features such as
CaIIK, CN, G-band, and TiO show similar trend with the bulge luminosity. On the
contrary, the Fe5270 and Fe5335 iron lines show a constant equivalent width -
within some dispersion - for all bulges. A simple application of a stellar
population synthesis model suggests that magnesium should be most enhanced with
respect to iron in the brightest bulges. Concerning the structural parameters,
bulges do occupy the same region in the fundamental plane as ellipticals. In
conclusion, the present study favors the idea that the bulk of stars in bulges
have formed with only moderate or negligible influence of the disk material,

\alpha=0.45+-0.09, whilst for the AGN it is \alpha=0.96+-0.03. The power-law
model is a good fit for ~90% of NELGs and ~75% of AGN. Recent work shows that
the fractional surface density of NELGs increases with respect to AGN at faint

(\alpha~0.4, 1-10 keV) is harder than that of AGN (\alpha~1) but our results

this idea. Its small amplitude indicates a very young age for the population,

a young QSO is surrounded by a shell of young massive stars mixed with
significant amounts of dust. We predict that as the QSO emerges from this dust
cocoon, it will eventually take on the appearance of a normal BALQSO.

  Astronomy & Astrophysics Main Journal",,,,"astro-ph",,"  A new method for measuring the shear induced by gravitational light
deflection is proposed. It is based on analyzing the anisotropy induced in the
auto-correlation function (ACF) of the extragalactic background light which is
produced by very faint distant galaxies. The ACF can be measured `locally', and
its anisotropy is caused by the tidal gravitational field of the deflecting
mass distribution in the foreground of these faint background galaxies. Since
the method does not require individual galaxy detection, it can be used to
measure the shear of extremely faint galaxies which are not detectable
individually, but are present in the noise. The shear estimated from the ACF of
the noise provides an independent measurement which can be compared to the
shear obtained from the distortion of individual galaxy images. Combining these
two independent estimates clearly increases the sensitivity of shear
measurements. In addition, our method may allow to determine the local
magnification caused by the deflector if the auto-correlation function is
caused by a large number density of faint galaxies; in this case, the intrinsic
ACF may provide a `standard source' with respect to which shear and
magnification can be obtained. Applications to real and synthetic data are
shown and the feasibility of our new method is demonstrated. In particular, we
present the shear maps obtained with our method for the double QSO 2345+007 and

density field in such a way as to reproduce both the observed luminosity and

shown that the VPF can discriminate between CDM and a cold+hot dark matter

that both CDM (as expected from a previous analysis) and BSI fit observational

density field. Therefore, while the void statistics is sensitive to the passage
from CDM to CHDM (different spectrum and different nature of dark matter), it
is not to the passage from CDM to BSI (different spectrum but same dark

criteria similar to those we have used for selecting high redshift galaxy

magnitudes equivalent to R <= 25.3, five have confirmed redshifts in the range

braiding, on the other fields exactly in the required way. Here we transform
this construction to the more conventional description of 2d gravity in terms
of Bloch wave/Coulomb gas vertex operators, thereby establishing for the first
time its quantum group symmetry properties. A $U_q(sl(2))\otimes U_q(sl(2))$
symmetry of a novel type emerges: The two Cartan-generator eigenvalues are
specified by the choice of matrix element (bra/ket Verma-modules); the two
Casimir eigenvalues are equal and specified by the Virasoro weight of the
vertex operator considered; the co-product is defined with a matching condition
dictated by the Hilbert space structure of the operator product. This hidden
symmetry possesses a novel Hopf like structure compatible with these
conditions.

correspond to the spectrum of one family of standard model fermions and hence,
is a starting point for constructing the dual standard model. At this level,
however, there is an extra monopole state - the ``diquark'' monopole - with no
corresponding standard model fermion. If the SU(3) factor now breaks down to
Z_3, the monopoles with non-trivial SU(3) charge get confined by strings in
SU(3) singlets. Another outcome of this symmetry breaking is that the diquark
monopole becomes unstable (metastable) to fragmentation into fundamental
monopoles and the one-one correspondence with the standard model fermions is
restored. We discuss the fate of the monopoles if the [SU(2)\times U(1)']/Z_2
factor breaks down to U(1)_Q by a Higgs mechanism as in the electroweak model.

applied to a number of multidimensional integrable systems, such as the KP

quantization. First the notion of a deformation of a noncommutative ringed
space over a commutative locally ringed space is introduced within a language
coming from Algebraic Geometry and Complex Analysis. Then we define what a
Dirac quantization of a commutative ringed space with a Poisson structure, the
space of classical observables, is. Afterwards the normal order quantization of
the Poisson space of classical polynomial observables on a cotangent bundle is
constructed. By using a complete symbol calculus on manifolds we succeed in
extending the normal order quantization of polynomial observables to a
quantization of a Poisson space of symbols on a cotangent bundle. Furthermore
we consider functorial properties of these quantizations. Altogether it is
shown that a deformation theoretical approach to quantization is possible not
only in a formal sense but also such that the deformation parameter $\hbar$ can
attain any real value.

consideration is the square root of the Dirac operator und thus the forms of
the generalized differential algebra constructed out of the spectral triple are
in a representation of the Lorentz group with integer spin if the form degree
is even and they are in a representation with half-integer spin if the form
degree is odd. However, we find that the 2-forms, obtained by squaring the

arising from the transmission of quantum entanglement through (possibly noisy)
quantum channels. A pure entangled state is prepared of a pair of systems $R$
and $Q$, after which $Q$ is subjected to a dynamical evolution given by the
superoperator $\superop^{Q}$. Two interesting quantities can be defined for
this process: the entanglement fidelity $F_{e}$ and the entropy production
$S_{e}$. It turns out that neither of these quantities depends in any way on
the system $R$, but only on the initial state and dynamical evolution of $Q$.
$F_{e}$ and $S_{e}$ are related to various other fidelities and entropies, and
are connected by an inequality reminiscent of the Fano inequality of classical
information theory. Some insight can be gained from these techniques into the
security of quantum cryptographic protocols and the nature of quantum
error-correcting codes.

(QECC) provide two ways of protecting quantum states from interaction with the
environment. In an EPP, perfectly entangled pure states are extracted, with
some yield D, from a mixed state M shared by two parties; with a QECC, an arbi-
trary quantum state $|\xi\rangle$ can be transmitted at some rate Q through a
noisy channel $\chi$ without degradation. We prove that an EPP involving one-
way classical communication and acting on mixed state $\hat{M}(\chi)$ (obtained
by sharing halves of EPR pairs through a channel $\chi$) yields a QECC on
$\chi$ with rate $Q=D$, and vice versa. We compare the amount of entanglement
E(M) required to prepare a mixed state M by local actions with the amounts
$D_1(M)$ and $D_2(M)$ that can be locally distilled from it by EPPs using one-
and two-way classical communication respectively, and give an exact expression
for $E(M)$ when $M$ is Bell-diagonal. While EPPs require classical communica-
tion, QECCs do not, and we prove Q is not increased by adding one-way classical
communication. However, both D and Q can be increased by adding two-way com-
munication. We show that certain noisy quantum channels, for example a 50%
depolarizing channel, can be used for reliable transmission of quantum states
if two-way communication is available, but cannot be used if only one-way com-
munication is available. We exhibit a family of codes based on universal hash-
ing able toachieve an asymptotic $Q$ (or $D$) of 1-S for simple noise models,
where S is the error entropy. We also obtain a specific, simple 5-bit single-
error-correcting quantum block code. We prove that {\em iff} a QECC results in
high fidelity for the case of no error the QECC can be recast into a form where
the encoder is the matrix inverse of the decoder.

temperature (0.15 < T < 0.8 K) for different concentrations of Zn impurities. A
small amount of Zn induces a dramatic decrease in the non-linear component of
the low-temperature thermal conductivity. Moreover, the magnitude of the linear
component (obtained by extrapolating the data to T=0) is found to depend on Zn
concentration. After an initial decrease, this linear term, associated with the
electronic contribution to the conductivity, increases with increasing Zn
dopage. Such an increase is consistent with the introduction of low-energy
excitations by Zn impurities as expected for a $d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconducting
state in contrast to an anisotropic s-wave gap. The results are compared to
quantitative predictions of available theoretical models.
