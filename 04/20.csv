proportion of HDF galaxies are undergoing a strong episode of star formation,
as evidenced by their very blue colours. A wide range of morphological types is
found, with a high proportion of peculiar and merger morphologies. Fitting the
multiband spectra with redshifted SEDs of galaxy types E to HII, we predict the
spectral types and redshifts of galaxies detected in the HDF. We find a median
redshift of 1.6, with $68\%$ having $z > 1$ and $31\%$ with $z >2$. The I-band
absolute magnitude distributions as a function of galaxy types show a plausible
trend of decreasing luminosity towards later types. The derived I-band
luminosity function agrees well with that from the Canada-France survey (Lilly
et al 1996) for $z < 1$ and shows strong luminosity evolution at $M_I < -21$
for $1 < z < 3$, comparable to the rate seen in quasars and starburst galaxies.
We have predicted infrared and submillimetre fluxes assuming most of the
galaxies are undergoing a strong starburst. Several planned space-borne and
ground-based deep surveys are capable of detecting interesting numbers of HDF
galaxies.

survey was conducted in two broad band filters that closely match $V$ and $I$
and contains a total of 79 candidate clusters of galaxies, covering an
estimated redshift range $0.2 \simless z \simless 1.2$. We examine the color
evolution in the 57 richest clusters from this survey. The intermediate
redshift ($0.2 \simless z \simless 0.4$) clusters show a distinct locus of
galaxy colors in the color--magnitude diagram. This ridge line corresponds well
with the expected no--evolution color of present--day elliptical galaxies at
these redshifts. In clusters at redshifts of $z \simgreat 0.5$, this red
envelope has shifted bluewards compared to the ``no--evolution'' prediction. By
$z \sim 0.8$ there are only a few galaxies which are as red in their rest-frame
as present--day ellipticals. The detected evolution is consistent with passive
aging of stellar populations formed at redshifts of $z \simgreat 2$. Though the
uncertainties are large, the Butcher--Oemler effect is observed in the Palomar
clusters. The fraction of blue galaxies increases with the estimated redshift
of the cluster at a 96.2\% confidence level. The measured blue fractions of the
intermediate redshift clusters ($f_{b} \sim 0.2 - 0.3$) are consistent with
those found previously by Butcher \& Oemler (1984). The trend in the Palomar
clusters suggests that $f_{b}$ can be greater than 0.4 in clusters of galaxies

sequence turn-off (\mvto) are generally considered to be the most reliable from

In this paper, we advocate the use of the absolute magnitude of the point which
is brighter than the turn-off and 0.05 mag redder (\mvb) as a precision age
indicator. It is easy to measure this point on observed colour-magnitude
diagrams, leading to small observational error bars. Furthermore, an extensive
Monte Carlo calculation indicates that the theoretical uncertainty in \mvb\ is
similar to \mvto. As a result, ages derived using \mvb\ are at least a factor
of 2 more precise than those derived using \mvto. This technique is applied to
the globular cluster M68 and an age of $12.8\pm 0.3\,$Gyr is derived (assuming
$\mvrr = 0.20\,\feh + 0.98$), indicating that M68 is a `young' globular
cluster. A homogeneous set of globular cluster age estimates with this

behaviour of a bubble is dependent on the relative sizes of a characteristic
length scale $E^{-1}$, where $E$ is the driving field, and the separation, $L$,
of the interfaces. For $EL \gg 1$ the velocities of the interfaces are
negligible, while in the opposite limit a travelling-wave solution is found
with a velocity $v \propto E/L$. For this latter case ($EL \ll 1$) a set of
reduced equations, describing the evolution of the domain lengths, is obtained

In our proposal PSGA does not necessarily require the spin-charge separation or

superconductor.The low energy magnetic excitations are mainly governed by the
{\it itinerant nature of the intra-layer system} and {\it the inter-layer
antiferromagnetic coupling}. No matter how weak the bare inter-layer coupling
is, it can be dramatically enhanced due to the intra-layerspin fluctuations. As
the temperature decreases near the antiferromagnetic phase boundary the
strongly enhanced inter-layer correlation induces the inter-layer particle-hole
exchange scattering processes that tend to enhance the inter-layer spin singlet
formation and kill the triplet formation. We propose that the coupling of spin
fluctuations on the adjacend layers via the strong repulsive interaction
between parallel spins travelling on each layer give rise to the dynamical
screening effects. As a result the low energy part of the spin excitation
spectrum is strongly suppressed as the temperature decreases near the
antiferromagnetic phase boundary. We ascribe PSGA to this dynamical screening
effects.

original work in 1948 that the zero-point energy of quantum fields can be
modified by the presence of boundaries, and that these modifications generate
observable effects. For example, in Casimir's original work, the quantum

gauge potential, implying a quantization of the IIA cosmological constant.

if the topological term is regarded as the limit of a certain nontopological

multiplicative renormalization of the theta--parameter while fermions give rise
to an additional shift of theta. A truncated form of an exact renormalization
group equation is used to study the scale dependence of the theta--parameter.
Possible implications for the strong CP--problem of QCD are discussed.

The algorithm computes the so-called nilpotent presentation for a finitely
presented, nilpotent Lie ring. The nilpotent presentation consists of
generators for the abelian group and the products---expressed as linear
combinations---for pairs formed by generators. Using that presentation the word
problem is decidable in $L$. Provided that the Lie ring $L$ is graded, it is
possible to determine the canonical presentation for a lower central factor of
$L$. LieNQ's complexity is studied and it is shown that optimizing the
presentation is NP-hard. Computational details are provided with examples,
timing and some structure theorems obtained from computations. Implementation
in C and GAP 3.5 interface is available.

$\g$-characters of the fundamental group of $F$, corresponding to a
geometrically defined Poisson bracket. Finite type invariants for unoriented
knots and links are defined. Topologically free Kauffman bracket modules are
shown to generate finite type invariants. It is shown for compact $M$ that
$K(M)$ can be generated as a module by cables on a finite set of knots.
Moreover, if $M$ contains no incompressible surfaces, the module is finitely

This is accomplished by making the module into a combinatorial analog of the
ring, in which tools of skein theory are exploited to illuminate relations
among characters. We conclude with an application, proving that a small
manifold's specialized module is necessarily finite dimensional.
