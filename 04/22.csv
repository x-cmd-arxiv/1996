growing and, in some cases, purely oscillatory axisymmetric bending modes,
unlike their cold disk counterparts. A razor-thin disk with even a very small
degree of random motion in the plane is both unstable and possesses a discrete
spectrum of neutral modes, irrespective of the sharpness of the edge. Random
motion normal to the disk plane has a stabilizing effect but at the same time
allows bending waves to couple to the internal vibrations of the particles,
which causes the formerly neutral modes to decay through Landau damping.
  Focusing first on instabilities, I here determine the degree of random motion
normal to the plane needed to suppress global, axisymmetric, bending
instabilities in a family of self-gravitating disks. As found previously,
bending instabilities are suppressed only when the thickness exceeds that
expected from a na\""\i ve local criterion when the degree of pressure support
within the disk plane is comparable to, or exceeds, the support from rotation.
A modest disk thickness is adequate for the bending stability of most disk
galaxies, except perhaps near their centers.
  The discretization of the neutral spectrum in a zero-thickness disk is due to
the existence of a turning point for bending waves in a warm disk, which is
absent when the disk is cold. When the disk is given a finite thickness, the
discrete neutral modes generally become strongly damped through wave-particle
interactions. It is surprising therefore that I find some simulations of warm,
stable disks can support (quasi-)neutral, large-scale, bending modes that decay
very slowly, if at all.

ellipticals at $z=0.37$ is weaker than the mean Mg$_b$ of their local relatives
in the Coma and Virgo clusters. The Mg$_b$ weakening is smallest for the most
luminous ellipticals and larger for the fainter objects. This is unambiguous
evidence for {\it small but significant passive evolution} of the stellar
populations of elliptical galaxies with redshift. It requires that the bulk of
the stars in cluster ellipticals has formed at $z>2$. The most luminous objects
may even have formed at $z>4$. The Mg$_b-\sigma$ test is a very reliable

independent from the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and from the

computationally intensive and difficult to implement. Previous algorithms are
expensive due to two factors: the exponential number of rules that must be
generated and the use of a Monte Carlo parsing algorithm. In this paper we
solve the first problem by a novel reduction of the DOP model to a small,
equivalent probabilistic context-free grammar. We solve the second problem by a
novel deterministic parsing strategy that maximizes the expected number of
correct constituents, rather than the probability of a correct parse tree.
Using the optimizations, experiments yield a 97% crossing brackets rate and 88%
zero crossing brackets rate. This differs significantly from the results
reported by Bod, and is comparable to results from a duplication of Pereira and
Schabes's (1992) experiment on the same data. We show that Bod's results are at
least partially due to an extremely fortuitous choice of test data, and
partially due to using cleaner data than other researchers.

described in a quasiclassical picture using results of percolation theory for
two-dimensional systems. In accordance with the experimental situation, Lambda
is assumed to be much smaller than the sound wavelength 2*pi/q. This restricts
the absorption of surface phonons at a filling factor \bar{\nu} approx 1/2 to
electrons occupying extended trajectories of fractal structure. Both
piezoelectric and deformation potential interactions of surface acoustic
phonons with electrons are considered and the corresponding interaction
vertices are derived. These vertices are found to differ from those valid for
three-dimensional bulk phonon systems with respect to the phonon wave vector
dependence. We derive the appropriate dielectric function varepsilon(omega,q)
to describe the effect of screening on the electron-phonon coupling. In the low
temperature, high frequency regime T << Delta (omega_q*Lambda
/v_D)^{alpha/2/nu}, where omega_q is the SAW frequency and v_D is the electron
drift velocity, both the attenuation coefficient Gamma and varepsilon(omega,q)
are independent of temperature. The classical percolation indices give
alpha/2/nu=3/7. The width of the region where a strong absorption of the SAW
occurs is found to be given by the scaling law |Delta \bar{\nu}| approx
(omega_q*Lambda/v_D)^{alpha/2/nu}. The dependence of the electron-phonon
coupling and the screening due to the 2DEG on the filling factor leads to a
double-peak structure for Gamma(\bar{\nu}).

can receive potentially large contributions in some beyond SM scenarios and
this makes them very sensitive probes of new physics. In this article we show
that a non universal interaction, involving leptoquarks to the quark-lepton
pair of the third generation through helicity unsuppressed couplings of the
order of ordinary gauge couplings, can generate electric and weak dipole
moments of the order of $10^{-19}$ e-cm for the tau lepton. This is greater
than pure supersymmetric (SUSY) and left-right (L-R) contributions by almost
three orders of magnitude. It is also greater than mirror fermionic

reach sensitivities of $10^{-18}$ e-cm and $10^{-19}$ e-cm respectively in near
future. The observation of a non vanishing dipole moment of tau at these
facilities would therefore strongly favour superstring inspired light
leptoquark mediated interactions, over pure SUSY or L-R interactions and
perhaps also mirror generated mixings without some sort of quark-lepton

minimized. It is also pointed out that the decay rate $\Gamma (H\rightarrow

the integrability of the theory; i.e. by the existence of an infinite number of
conserved quantities which these theories are known to possess. One usually
expects the scattering of solitons in such theories to be rather simple, i.e.
trivial. By contrast, in this paper we generate new soliton solutions for the
planar integrable chiral model whose scattering properties are highly
nontrivial; more precisely, in head-on collisions of $N$ indistinguishable
solitons the scattering angle (of the emerging structures relative to the
incoming ones) is $\pi/N$. We also generate soliton-antisoliton solutions with
elastic scattering; in particular, a head-on collision of a soliton and an
antisoliton resulting in $90^0$ scattering.

T^{p}$ in the near-extremal regime. We extend these results to cases where the
dilaton is non-vanishing, but nevertheless remains finite on the horizon in the
extremal limit, showing that the ideal-gas relation is again satisfied. At the
classical level, however, this relation does break down if the dilaton diverges
on the horizon. We argue that such a divergence indicates the breakdown of the
validity of the classical approximation, and that by taking string and
worldsheet loop corrections into account, the validity of the
entropy/temperature relation may be extended to include these cases. This opens
up the possibility of giving a microscopic interpretation of the entropy for
all near-extremal $p$-branes.

  knot theory and field theory","34 pages, LaTeX",,,"OUT-4102-62","hep-th hep-ph math.QA q-alg",,"  A generating function is given for the number, $E(l,k)$, of irreducible
$k$-fold Euler sums, with all possible alternations of sign, and exponents
summing to $l$. Its form is remarkably simple: $\sum_n E(k+2n,k) x^n =
\sum_{d|k}\mu(d) (1-x^d)^{-k/d}/k$, where $\mu$ is the M\""obius function.
Equivalently, the size of the search space in which $k$-fold Euler sums of
level $l$ are reducible to rational linear combinations of irreducible basis
terms is $S(l,k) = \sum_{n<k}{\lfloor(l+n-1)/2\rfloor\choose n}$. Analytical
methods, using Tony Hearn's REDUCE, achieve this reduction for the 3698
convergent double Euler sums with $l\leq44$; numerical methods, using David
Bailey's MPPSLQ, achieve it for the 1457 convergent $k$-fold sums with
$l\leq7$; combined methods yield bases for all remaining search spaces with
$S(l,k)\leq34$. These findings confirm expectations based on Dirk Kreimer's
connection of knot theory with quantum field theory. The occurrence in
perturbative quantum electrodynamics of all 12 irreducible Euler sums with
$l\leq 7$ is demonstrated. It is suggested that no further transcendental
occurs in the four-loop contributions to the electron's magnetic moment.
Irreducible Euler sums are found to occur in explicit analytical results, for
counterterms with up to 13 loops, yielding transcendental knot-numbers, up to
23 crossings.

either only D5-branes, or no D-branes at all. This latter case is an example of
a consistent purely closed unoriented string theory. The spectra of the

systematically investigated using particle-particle coincidence techniques at a
$^{35}$Cl bombarding energy of $\sim$ 8 MeV/nucleon. The fragment-fragment
correlation data show that the majority of events arises from a binary-decay
process with rather large numbers of secondary light-charged particles emitted
from the two excited exit fragments. No evidence is observed for ternary
break-up events. The binary-process results of the present measurement, along
with those of earlier, inclusive experimental data obtained at several lower
bombarding energies are compared with predictions of two different kinds of
statistical model calculations. These calculations are performed using the
transition-state formalism and the Extended Hauser-Feshbach method and are
based on the available phase space at the saddle point and scission point of
the compound nucleus, respectively. The methods give comparable predictions and
are both in good agreement with the experimental results thus confirming the
fusion-fission origin of the fully-damped yields. The similarity of the
predictions for the two models supports the claim that the scission point
configuration is very close to that of the saddle point for the light $^{47}$V
mass-asymmetry-dependent fission barriers needed in the transition-state
calculation.
