amenable. We then formulate an approximation property which we prove to be a
sufficient condition for amenability.
  A theory of $\Gamma$-graded C*-algebras possessing a conditional expectation
is developed, with an eye on the Fell bundle that one naturally associates to
the grading. We show, for instance, that all such algebras are isomorphic to
$C^*_r(\B)$, when the bundle is amenable.

interest here are of various surprising ``exotic'' smoothness structures on
topologically trivial manifolds such as ${S^7}$ and ${\bf R^4}$. Since no two
of these are diffeomorphic to each other, each such manifold represents a
physically distinct model of topologically trivial spacetime. That is, these
are not merely different coordinate representations of a given spacetime. The
path to such structures intertwines many branches of mathematics and
theoretical physics (Yang-Mills and other gauge theories). An overview of these
topics is provided, followed by certain results concerning the geometry and
physics of such manifolds. Although exotic ${\bf R^4}$'s cannot be effectively

of light-cone Fock methods to compute loop amplitudes is illustrated by the
example of the electron anomalous moment in QED. In other applications, such as
the computation of the axial, magnetic, and quadrupole moments of light nuclei,
the QCD relativistic Fock state description provides new insights which go well
beyond the usual assumptions of traditional hadronic and nuclear physics.

not be identical. In this paper we investigate the sea quark/antiquark
asymmetries in the nucleon wavefunction which are generated by a light-cone
model of energetically-favored meson-baryon fluctuations. The model predicts
striking quark/antiquark asymmetries in the momentum and helicity distributions
for the down and strange contributions to the proton structure function: the
intrinsic $d$ and $s$ quarks in the proton sea are predicted to be negatively
polarized, whereas the intrinsic $\bar d$ and $\bar s$ antiquarks give zero
contributions to the proton spin. Such a picture is supported by experimental
phenomena related to the proton spin problem and the violation of the
Ellis-Jaffe sum rule. The light-cone meson-baryon fluctuation model also
suggests a structured momentum distribution asymmetry for strange quarks and
antiquarks which could be relevant to an outstanding conflict between two
different determinations of the strange quark sea in the nucleon. The model
predicts an excess of intrinsic $d \bar d$ pairs over $u \bar u$ pairs, as
supported by the Gottfried sum rule violation. We also predict that the
intrinsic charm and anticharm helicity and momentum distributions are not
identical.

unphysical oscillators and is restricted to level 1. At higher level, the new
operators are transcendental functions of DDF ``oscillators'' unlike the

studied using the spherical shell model and the HFB method. The two
descriptions lead to nearly the same values for the relevant observables. A
first backbending is predicted at I=10\hbar corresponding to a collective to
non-collective transition. At I=16\hbar a second backbending occurs, associated
to a configuration change that can also be interpreted as an spherical to
triaxial transition.

  Squeezed States and Uncertainty Relations"", NASA Conf. Pub.3322.(1995)",,,"quant-ph",,"  We introduce and study the properties of a class of coherent states for the
group SU(1,1) X SU(1,1) and derive explicit expressions for these using the
Clebsch-Gordan algebra for the SU(1,1) group. We restrict ourselves to the
discrete series representations of SU(1,1). These are the generalization of the
`Barut Girardello' coherent states to the Kronecker Product of two non-compact
groups.The resolution of the identity and the analytic phase space
representation of these states is presented. This phase space representation is
based on the basis of products of `pair coherent states' rather than the
standard number state canonical basis. We discuss the utility of the resulting
`bi-pair coherent states' in the context of four-mode interactions in quantum
optics.

factored using a variety of species of ion is determined.

pairs of photons and between pairs of protons. It is proposed to measure these
correlations between the proton and the neutron emerging from breakup of the
deuteron induced by gamma rays near threshold. The feasibility of the
experiment is discussed. Polarimeters with substantially higher overall
efficiency than the presently reported value of $10^{-4}$ are needed in order
to get enough events.
