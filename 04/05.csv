radio flux and size of M81* for the observed bolometric luminosity of the

We point out that the usually applied free, conical jet emission model implies
a longitudinal pressure gradient that must lead to a moderate acceleration of
the jet along its flow direction. This, usually neglected, gradual acceleration
naturally accounts for the inverted spectrum and the size/frequency relation of
M81* and may be a general feature of radio cores. M81* is so far the best case
for a radio-loud jet nature of the compact radio core in the nucleus of a
nearby spiral galaxy. The fact that one can account for Sgr A* and M81* with
the same model by simply changing the accretion rate, strongly supports the
jet-disk symbiosis model as an explanation for the compact radio cores of
galaxies in general.

report the results of two photoelectric observations of HS\,2324+39, which
clearly show that the luminosity of this star presents periodical variations
with a period of (2140 $\pm$ 11) s. This photometric behaviour is most easily
explained by the presence of non-radial oscillations. Therefore HS\,2324+39 is
a new member of the GW Vir group, and is characterized by the longest pulsation
period found among these stars. Moreover HS\,2324+39 appears to be the first
pulsating PG\,1159 star with a high H abundance in its atmosphere (H/He = 2 by
number, Dreizler et al. 1995). Were the pulsation mechanism based on the C/O
cyclic ionization (Starrfield et al. 1984) at work, the H abundance should drop
to zero sharply in the driving regions. Such a strong decrease of hydrogen
looks quite unlikely; for this reason the presence of pulsations in HS\,2324+39
seems to be a very interesting phenomenon.

rather smaller than the fermion mass~$m_q$. Therefore, artifacts of order

naturally in many superstring compactifications, and produces a small
parameter, which we use to determine the quark mass hierarchy. We show that
hierarchy and mixings among the chiral fermions is a consequence of the

nontrivial, exactly unitary, partitioning cellular automata. We find a one
parameter family of evolution rules which are best interpreted as those for a
one particle quantum automaton. This model is naturally reformulated as a two
component cellular automaton which we demonstrate to limit to the Dirac
equation. We describe two generalizations of this automaton, the second of
which, to multiple interacting particles, is the correct definition of a
