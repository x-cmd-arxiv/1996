symbiotic stars, the model consists of radiation from a hot star and an
emission nebula excited by that star. The observations were compared to
theoretical models in which the hot star's emission is calculated with the help
of hydrostatic and Wolf-Rayet-type non-LTE model atmospheres. Our analysis
clearly shows evidence for mass loss rates of several 10^{-6} Msolar/yr. The
minimum effective temperature compatible with both the observed UV and X-ray
flux is about 260000K, which is higher than in any other star analyzed with
sophisticated NLTE model atmospheres.
  Since the hydrostatic surface is hidden by the stellar wind no upper limit
for the temperature can be determined. However, we were able to determine the
total luminosity of a symbiotic nova with reasonable accuracy
L_SMC3=10^{4.05\pm 0.05} Lsun. This value is well below the Eddington limit
(approx. 50000~Lsun). In order to reproduce the observed energy distribution a

terms of the first and second invariant of the inertia tensor of the Lagrangian
volume enclosing the protoobject's collapsing mass. We then specialize the
formalism to the particular case in which this volume is centered on a peak of
the smoothed Gaussian density field and approximated by an isodensity
ellipsoid. The result is the appropriate analytical estimate for the rms
angular momentum of peaks to be compared against simulations that make use of
the Hoffman-Ribak algorithm to set up a constrained density field that contains
a peak with given shape. Extending the work of Heavens & Peacock, we calculate
the joint probability distribution function for several spin parameters and
peak mass M using the distribution of peak shapes, for different initial power
spectra. The values of observed specific angular momentum versus mass are well
fitted by our theoretical isoprobability contours. In contrast, the observed
lower values for the specific angular momentum for ellipticals of the same mass
cannot be accounted for within our linear regime investigation, highlighting
the importance of strongly non-linear phenomena to explain the spin of such

very similar to the brown dwarf Teide 1. Calar 3, together with Teide 1, allows
one to compare the spectroscopic characteristics of Pleiades brown dwarfs with
those of old very cool dwarfs. The overall spectral properties are similar, but
there are slight differences in the NaI doublet (818.3 nm, 819.5 nm), VO

reasonably well the number counts in the $U,~b_j,~r_f,~I$, and $K$ bands, as
well as the colour and redshift distributions derived from most of the existing

Significantly worse fits are obtained with PLE models for the theoretically
attractive value of $\Omega = 1$, although a simple number luminosity evolution
model with a significant amount of merger events fits the data also in this
cosmology.

bent, FR\,I-type lobes, which follow the emission-line spiral structure at
their inner edge. In the central region of the galaxy a double radio source is
observed with a separation of approximately 1\,arcsec between its components,
which are extremely well aligned with the hotspot from which the southern lobe
expands outwards. Hill et al (1988) suggested a model for the emission-line
spiral structure invoking compressed interstellar matter, which is dragged away
from the original jet path by the rotating ambient medium. From consideration
of the propagation speed of the jets and the transverse ram pressure exerted by
the rotating environment, we exclude this scenario as a possible origin of the
spiral structure. We favour a model in which the jets themselves are bent by
the rotating interstellar medium and possibly follows the emission-line spiral
arms. We present fits of the model to the observed optical spiral structure.

generated by symmetry operators which yields two reduced equations with
different characteristics. One equation is of the Liouville type and gives rise
to gravitational instantons, including those found by Eguchi-Hanson and
Gibbons-Hawking. The second equation appears for the first time in the theory
of heavenly spaces and provides meron-like configurations endowed with a
fractional topological charge. A link is also established between the heavenly
equation and the socalled Schr{\""o}der equation, which plays a crucial role in
the bootstrap model and in the renormalization theory.

spinor particles interacting through the abelian and non-Abelian Chern-Simons
gauge fields is carried out and is shown to be mathematically ill defined due
to the absence of the transverse components of these gauge fields. This is
remedied by the introduction of the Maxwell or the Maxwell-type (in the
non-Abelian case)term which makes the theory superrenormalizable and guarantees
its gauge-invariant regularization and renormalization. The generating
functionals are constructed and shown to be formally the same as those of QED
(or QCD) in 2+1 dimensions with the substitution of the Chern-Simons propagator
for the photon (gluon) propagator. By constructing the propagator in the
general case, the existence of two limits; pure Chern-Simons and QED (QCD)
after renormalization is demonstrated.
  By carrying out carefully the path integral quantization of the non-Abelian
Chern-Simons theories using the De Witt-Fadeev-Popov and the Batalin-Fradkin-
Vilkovisky methods it is demonstrated that there is no need to quantize the
dimensionless charge of the theory. The main reason is that the action in the
exponent of the path integral is BRST-invariant which acquires a zero winding
number and guarantees the BRST renormalizability of the model.
  The S-matrix operator is constructed, and starting from this S-matrix
operator novel topological unitarity identities are derived that demand the
vanishing of the gauge-invariant sum of the imaginary parts of the Feynman
diagrams with a given number of intermediate on-shell topological photon lines
in each order of perturbation theory. These identities are illustrated by an
explicit example.

usually called forth in literature to explain the phenomenon of particle
production by time independent classical electromagnetic backgrounds. We show
that the imaginary part of the effective lagrangian is zero for a complex
scalar field quantized in a time independent, but otherwise arbitrary, magnetic
field. This result implies that no pair creation takes place in such a
background. But we find that when the quantum field is decomposed into its
normal modes in the presence of a spatially confined and time independent
magnetic field, there exists a non-zero tunnelling probability for the
effective Schr{\"" o}dinger equation. According to the tunnelling
interpretation, this result would imply that spatially confined magnetic fields
can produce particles, thereby contradicting the result obtained from the
effective lagrangian. This lack of consistency between these two approaches
calls into question the validity of attributing a non-zero tunnelling
probability for the effective Schr{\"" o}dinger equation to the production of
particles by the time independent electromagnetic backgrounds. The implications
of our analysis are discussed.

matter as non-overlapping MIT bags bound by the self-consistent exchange of
scalar and vector mesons, is modified by introducing medium modification of the
bag constant. We model the density dependence of the bag constant in two
different ways: one invokes a direct coupling of the bag constant to the scalar
meson field, and the other relates the bag constant to the in-medium nucleon
mass. Both models feature a decreasing bag constant with increasing density. We
find that when the bag constant is significantly reduced in nuclear medium with
respect to its free-space value, large canceling isoscalar Lorentz scalar and
vector potentials for the nucleon in nuclear matter emerge naturally. Such
potentials are comparable to those suggested by relativistic nuclear
phenomenology and finite-density QCD sum rules. This suggests that the
reduction of bag constant in nuclear medium may play an important role in low-
and medium-energy nuclear physics.

this solution represents a stable, spatially homogeneous time-periodic solution
of the PDE. We show that when the diffusion coefficients become small, the
spatially homogeneous periodic solution becomes unstable and bifurcates into
spatially nonhomogeneous periodic solutions.
  The nature of the bifurcation is determined by the twistedness of an
equilibrium/homoclinic bifurcation that occurs as the diffusion coefficients
decrease. In the nontwisted case two spatially nonhomogeneous simple periodic
solutions of equal period are generated, while in the twisted case a unique
spatially nonhomogeneous double periodic solution is generated through
period-doubling.

force $\sigma$, the winding number $\omega$ of the ground state configuration
is a rational number in the $q_c$-th level Farey tree. For fixed $\omega=p/q$,
there is a critical $\lambda_c$ when a first order phase transition occurs.
This phase transition can be understood as the dissociation of a large molecule
into two smaller ones in a manner dictated by the Farey tree. A kind of
