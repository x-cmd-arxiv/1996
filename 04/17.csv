optically identified QSO absorbers is compiled from the literature. This
results in a largely unbiased sample of galaxies at high redshifts, the size of
the sample being reasonably large to allow for a first comparison with galaxy
evolution models. We use our evolutionary spectral synthesis models describing
various spectral types of galaxies with appropriate star formation histories.
  For a standard cosmology H0=50, Omega0=1, we find that all identified QSO
absorbers up to a redshift about z=2 do fall within the evolving range of
models which had been shown earlier to give good agreement with nearby galaxies
of various spectral types.
  The most striking result is that all spectral types of galaxies from E
through Sd seem to be present in this absorber candidate sample with the bulk
of the objects being spirals of type Sa to Sc.
  We also show that such kind of high redshift galaxy sample should allow for
significant restrictions of the cosmological parameters. While models with
H0=50, Omega0=1 and any redshift of galaxy formation zform=5 ... 10 give
reasonable agreement with observed luminosities and colors, present data seem
to exclude the combination H0=50, Omega0=0.1. A low Omega0 together with a
value of H0 > 50 might still be viable. Additional data, and in particular
observations of absorbing galaxies in more than one passband, are required for
further constraints. We realize that the present results depend on the adopted
evolutionary models and on the input physics used which might be better
constrained by future observations.

For nearly all the galaxies in our sample, the logarithmic slope of the
luminosity density measured at 0.1"" (the innermost reliable measurement with
the uncorrected HST) is significantly different from zero; i.e. most elliptical
galaxies have cusps. There are only two galaxies for which an analytic core
cannot be excluded. The distribution of logarithmic slopes at 0.1"" appears to
be bimodal, confirming the conclusion of Lauer et al. (1995) that early-type
galaxies can be divided into two types based on their surface-brightness

continue essentially unchanged in to the resolution limit. The peaks in the
slope distribution occur at -0.8 and -1.9. More than half of the galaxies have
slopes steeper than -1.0. Taken together with the recent theoretical work of

Within this hierarchy, the Galaxy is built via mergers of protogalactic
fragments. We find that early bursts of star formation lead to a large
population of remnants (mostly white dwarfs), which would reside presently in
the halo and contribute to the dark component observed in the microlensing
experiments. The hot, metal-rich gas from early starbursts and merging
evaporates from the clouds and is eventually incorporated into the
intergalactic medium. The model thus suggests that most microlensing objects
could be white dwarfs ($m \sim 0.5 \msol$), which comprise a significant
fraction of the halo mass. Furthermore, the Local Group could have a component
of metal-rich hot gas similar to, although less than, that observed in larger
clusters. We discuss the known constraints on such a scenario and show that all
local observations can be satisfied with present data in this model. The
best-fit model has a halo that is 40% baryonic, with an upper limit of 77%.

upon doping owing to the polaron effects. When the C60-polymer is doped with
two electrons per one C60, the system is insulating. When the conjugation in
the direction of the polymer chain is smaller, it is a direct-gap insulator.
The energy gap becomes indirect when the conjugation is stronger. We also study
the antiferromagnetic phase of AC60 by using a tight-binding model with
long-range Coulomb interactions. The antiferromagnetism is well described by
the model. The comparison with the photoemission studies shows that the new
band around the Fermi energy of the AC60 phase can be explaind by the extremely
large intrusion of an energy level into the gap of the neutral system. This
indicates that the interaction effects among electrons are important in doped
C60-polymers.

dyonic black holes in 4 and 5 dimensions. For the self-dual string in 6

scaling of the near-extremal Bekenstein-Hawking entropy with the Hawking

superspace interpretation of top or bottom states in a light-cone string
superfield. The presence of a non-trivial open-string boundary condensate give
rise to the familiar $D$-brane source terms that determine the (linearized)
Born--Infeld-like effective actions for $p$-branes and the (linearized)
equations of motion for the massless fields implied by the usual $p$-brane
ansatze. The `energy' due to closed string exchange between separate $D$-branes
is calculated (to lowest order in the string coupling) in situations with pairs
of parallel, intersecting as well as orthogonal branes -- in which case the
unbroken supersymmetry may be reduced. Configurations of more than two branes
are also considered in situations in which the supersymmetry is reduced to
$1/8$ or $1/16$ of the full amount. The Ward identities resulting from the
non-linearly realized broken space-time supersymmetry in the presence of a
$D$-brane are also discussed.

the moduli to their low energy minima are discussed explicitly: coinciding
minima at a point of enhanced symmetry, and the smooth transition from high to
