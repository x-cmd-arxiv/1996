they shift in wavelength as a function of orbital phase, with maximum blueshift
coinciding with infrared and X-ray minimum, and maximum redshift half an orbit

Survey for bright QSOs. The objects have been selected as QSO candidate on the
basis of its blue continuum and the apparent absence of strong hydrogen or
helium lines. One star, HE1211-1707, shows a rather fast spectral variability:
both the strength and the position of the shallow absorption features change on
a time scale of 20 minutes. We interpret this variability as being due to a
magnetic field on the surface of a rotating white dwarf, having a relatively
uniform magnetic field on one hemisphere and a much larger spread of field
strengths visible during other phases of the rotational period. All attempts to
determine the magnetic field structure in detail with the help of synthetic
spectra have failed so far because the star must have a rather complicated
field geometry. However, both the optical and the UV spectra indicate that a
significant part of the surface is dominated by a magnetic field strength of
about 80 MG. The spectrum of HE 0127-3110 is also rotationally modulated. This
star (approximate range of magnetic fields: 85-345 MG) as well as HE 2201-2250
(a spectroscopic twin of HE 0127-3110) and HE 0000-3430 (43-118 MG) could be
reasonably well reproduced with the help of theoretical spectra calculated
assuming magnetic dipoles which are offset by 0.1 and 0.2 stellar radii along
the magnetic axis. This result is in agreement with the assumption that Ap
stars, also showing significant deviations from a centered dipole, are the
progenitors of magnetic white dwarfs.

history. Absorption spectra of lines of sight through the Milky Way and through
nearby galaxies reveal a variety of chemical species, ionization conditions,
and kinematic substructures. These absorption profiles are produced by low
density gas distributed in rotating disks, high velocity halo clouds, satellite
galaxies and their debris, superbubbles, and other sub-galactic gaseous
fragments. Guided by knowledge gained by studying nearby galaxies, we are
developing interpretations of the variety of observed absorption signatures.

transition at the Taylor Reynolds number $\rel \approx 700$. Here correlation
function data is analyzed which gives further evidence for this transition. It
is seen in both the power spectrum and in structure function measurements. Two
possible explanations may be offered for this observed transition: that it is
intrinsic to the turbulence flow in this closed box experiment or that it is an
effect of a change in the flow around the anemometer. We particularly examine a
pair of ``probe effects''. The first is a thermal boundary layer which does
exist about the probe and does limit the probe response, particularly at high
frequencies. Arguments based on simulations of the response and upon
observations of dissipation suggests that this effect is only crucial beyond
$\rel\approx 2000$. The second effect is produced by vortex shedding behind the
probe. This has been seen to produce a large modification in some of the power
spectra for large $\rel$. It might also complicate the interpretation of the
experimental results. However, there seems to be a remaining range of data for
$\rel < 1300$ uncomplicated by these effects, and which are thus suggestive of
an intrinsic transition.

  489, edited by R.V. Moody (Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1997) pp. 199-237",,"ITFA-96-07","cond-mat",,"  We consider several aspects of non-periodic Ising models in one and two
dimensions. Here we are not interested in random systems, but rather in models
with intrinsic long-range aperiodic order. The most prominent examples in one
dimension are sequences generated by substitution rules on a finite alphabet.
The classical one-dimensional Ising chain as well as the Ising quantum chain
with coupling constants modulated according to substitution sequences are
considered. Both the distribution of Lee-Yang zeros on the unit circle in the
classical case and that of fermion frequencies in the quantum model show
characteristic gap structures which follow the gap labeling theorem of
Bellissard. We also investigate the zero-field Ising model on two-dimensional
aperiodic graphs, which are constructed from rectangular grids in the same
spirit as the so-called Labyrinth. Here, duality arguments and exact solutions
in the sense of commuting transfer matrices are used to gain information about
the critical behaviour.

Young's modulus or bulk modulus) as a power series in the applied load. The
inverse bulk modulus K, for example depends on the compression P: $ {1/ K(P)} =
c_0 + c_1 P + c_2 P^2 \cdots + c_n P^n + \cdots $. Elastic materials that allow
cracks are unstable at finite temperature with respect to fracture under a
stretching load; as a result, the above power series has zero radius of
convergence and thus can at best be an asymptotic series. Considering thermal
nucleation of cracks in a two-dimensional isotropic, linear--elastic material
at finite temperature we compute the asymptotic form $ { c_{n+1}/ c_n}\to C

cluster chain in several different ways. We do not know if in such a situation
Nature chooses a particular configuration at random, or if some configuration
is dynamically favoured. Also in the perturbative parton cascade we have no
well founded recipe for describing the interference effects, which correspond
to non planar diagrams and are caused by identical colour charges. We have
studied two different models, and are in particular interested in the
possibility that a colour singlet gluon system hadronizes isolated from the
remainder of the state. Using double tagged events with heavy $\epc\epca$ or
$\epb\epba$ quarks, it appears to be possible to find a significant signal, if
such events appear in Nature.

indication that reconnection might appear between the decay products of two W's
