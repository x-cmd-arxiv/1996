analysis demonstrates that heating on circular and low-eccentricity orbits can

eccentric orbits either due to strong relaxation caused by the high densities
needed for tidal limitation or due to efficient bulge shocking of low density
clusters.
  The combination of effects leads to strong evolution of the population as a
whole. For example, within the solar circle, tidally-limited 10^5 M_sun
clusters lose at least 40% of their mass in 10 Gyr. At high eccentricity most
of these clusters evaporate completely. Bulge shocking disrupts clusters within
40 kpc which have less than 80% of their mass within their pericentric inner
Lagrange point. Our results are consistent with suggestions that the shape of
the cluster luminosity function results from evaporation and disruption of low
mass clusters; they further predict that the net velocity dispersion of the
cluster system in the inner Galaxy has decreased with time. Preliminary
constraints on formation models are also discussed. We conclude that the
observed cluster system has largely been shaped by dynamical selection.

to reduce the discriminatory power of the statistic. However, studying

removed leads to interesting information about the amount of power on cluster

directly and compare this to the values obtained using the Davis-Peebles

the possibility that globular clusters (GCs) are formed from primordial mass
fluctuations, whose mass scale ($10^8$ - $10^9$ M$_{\odot}$) is selected out of
a CDM spectrum by the mechanism of non-equilibrium formation of $H_2$. We show
that such clouds are able to convert about 0.003 of their total mass into a
bound system (GC) and about 0.02 into halo stars. The metal enriched gas is
dispersed away from the GC by supernova explosions and forms the galactic disk.
These mass ratios between GCs, halo and disk depend on the predicted IMF which
is a consequence of the universal statistics of fluid turbulence. They also
depend on the ratio of baryonic over non-baryonic mass ,$X_b$, and are
comparable with the values observed in typical spiral galaxies for $X_b \approx
0.1-0.2$. The computed mass and radius for a GC ( $5\times 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$

model predicts an exponential cut off in the stellar IMF below 0.1 M$_{\odot}$

primordial clouds leads to a large number of supernovae and to a high blue

assumes charged particles undergo spatial diffusion in a uniform magnetic
field. If, however, the magnetic field is not uniform, but has a stochastic or
braided structure, the transport of charged particles across the average
direction of the field is more complicated. Assuming quasi-linear behaviour of
the field lines, the particles undergo sub-diffusion on short time scales. We
derive the propagator for such motion, which differs from the Gaussian form
relevant for diffusion, and apply it to a configuration with a plane shock
front whose normal is perpendicular to the average field direction. Expressions
are given for the acceleration time as a function of the diffusion coefficient
of the wandering magnetic field lines and the spatial diffusion coefficient of
the charged particles parallel to the local field. In addition we calculate the
spatial dependence of the particle density in both the upstream and downstream
plasmas. In contrast to the diffusive case, the density of particles at the
shock front is lower than it is far downstream. This is a consequence of the
partial trapping of particles by structures in the magnetic field. As a result,
the spectrum of accelerated particles is a power-law in momentum which is
steeper than in the diffusive case. For a phase- space density $f\propto
p^{-s}$, we find $s=\sdiff[1+1/(2\rcomp)]$, where $\rcomp$ is the compression
ratio of the shock front and $\sdiff$ is the standard result of diffusive
acceleration: $\sdiff=3\rcomp/(\rcomp-1)$. A strong shock in a monatomic ideal
gas yields a spectrum of $s=4.5$. In the case of electrons, this corresponds to
a radio synchrotron spectral index of $\alpha=0.75$.

combines corpus independent hand-crafted constraint rules, constraint rules
that are learned via unsupervised learning from a training corpus, and
additional statistical information from the corpus to be morphologically
disambiguated. The hand-crafted rules are linguistically motivated and tuned to
improve precision without sacrificing recall. The unsupervised learning process
produces two sets of rules: (i) choose rules which choose morphological parses

and (ii) delete rules, which delete parses satisfying a constraint. Our
approach also uses a novel approach to unknown word processing by employing a
secondary morphological processor which recovers any relevant inflectional and
derivational information from a lexical item whose root is unknown. With this
approach, well below 1 percent of the tokens remains as unknown in the texts we

delocalised, is transformed into a solid state, in which a nonzero fraction of
macromolecules have spontaneously become localised. This solid state is a most
unusual one: localisation occurs about mean positions that are distributed
homogeneously and randomly, and to an extent that varies randomly from monomer
to monomer. Thus, the solid state emerging at the vulcanisation transition is
an equilibrium amorphous solid state: it is properly viewed as a solid state
