Although we identify over $80\%$ of the absorption features and analyze several
of the more complex metal-line systems, we focus our analysis on the damped
\Lya system at $z=2.462$. Ionization simulations suggest the hydrogen in this
system is significantly neutral and all of the observed metals are
predominantly singly ionized. We measure accurate abundances for Fe, Cr, Si, Ni
and place a lower limit on the abundance of Zn: [Fe/H] = $-0.830 \pm 0.051$,
[Cr/H] = $-0.902 \pm 0.064$, [Si/H] = $-0.376 \pm 0.052$, [Ni/H] = $-1.002 \pm
0.054$ and [Zn/H] $> -0.562 \pm 0.064$. We give evidence suggesting the actual
Zn abundance is [Zn/H] $\approx -0.262$, implying the highest metallicity
observed at a redshift $z \geq 2$. The relative abundances of these elements
remains constant over essentially the entire system ($\approx 150$ \kms in
velocity space), suggesting it is well mixed. Furthermore, we use the lack of
abundance variations to infer properties of the dust responsible for element
depletion. Finally, we discuss the kinematic characteristics of this damped
\Lya system, comparing and contrasting it with other systems. The low-ion line
profiles span $\approx 200$ \kms in velocity space and have an asymmetric shape
with the strongest feature on the red edge. These kinematic characteristics are
consistent with a rotating disk model.

central engines of active galctic nuclei (AGN) are likely to form shock waves
in the accreting plasma. Such shocks, which may be either collisional or
collisionless, can contribute to the observed high energy temporal and spectral
variability. Our Rationale is the following: Observations show that the
continuum emission probably originates in an optically thin, hot plasma in the
AGN central engine. The flux and spectrum from this hot plasma varies
significantly over light crossing timescales. several authors have suggested
that macroscopic perturbations contained within this plasma are the sources of
this variability. In order to produce the observed emission the perturbations
must be radiatively coupled with the optically thin hot matter and must also
move with high velocities. We suggest that shocks, which can be very effective
in randomizing the bulk motion of the perturbations, are responsible for this
coupling. Shocks should form in the central engine, because the temperatures
and magnetic fields are probably reduced below their virial values by radiative
dissipation. Perturbations moving at Keplerian speeds, or strong nonlinear
excitations, result in supersonic and super-Alfvenic velocities leading to
shock waves whithin the hot plasma
  We Show that even a perturbation significantly smaller than the emitting
region can form a shock which significantly modifies the continuum emission in
an AGN, and that the spectral and temporal variability from such a shock
generally resemble those of radio quiet AGN. As an example, the shock inducing
perturbation in our model is a small main sequence star, the capturing and
eventual accretion of which are known to be a plausible process. We argue that

estimate of the Hubble constant from their emission signatures at late phases

Ruiz--Lapuente \& Lucy (1992), makes use here of an improved modeling of the
forbidden line emission at late phases. Hydrodynamic models of the explosion of
WDs of different masses, both sub--Chandrasekhar and Chandrasekhar, provide the
basis for comparison with the observations. It is shown that it is possible to
probe the overall density structure of the ejecta and the mass of the exploding
WD by the effect that the electron density profile has in shaping the forbidden
line emission of the iron ions, and that a robust diagnostic of the mass of the
exploding WD can be obtained. Cosmic distance scale can thus be related to
basic diagnostics of excitation of iron lines. Once the most adequate model is
selected, comparison of the predicted line emission at these phases with the
observed spectra gives an internal estimate of both the reddening and the
distance to the SNe Ia. The results presented here favor denser models than
those corresponding to sub--Chandrasekhar explosions. From a sample of seven
SNe Ia in Leo, Virgo, Fornax and beyond, a value of the Hubble constant $H_{0}

calibrated them on the system of Faber et al. [ApJS, 57, 711 (1985)]. Here, we
use the $\langle{\rm Fe}\rangle$ index to derive an abundance distribution in

  Our derived values of [Fe/H] agree well with those measured from
high--resolution echelle spectra (e.g., McWilliam \& Rich [ApJS, 91, 749

$\langle{\rm [Fe/H]}\rangle = -0.11 \pm 0.04$ for our sample of Baade's Window

confirm that, in Baade's Window, most K giants with $V < 15.5$ are foreground
disk stars, but the great majority (more than 80\%) with $V > 16$ belong to the
bulge.
  We also compare the metallicities derived from the CN and Mg$_2$ indices to
those from iron. Most of the metal--rich stars in our sample appear to be
CN--weak, in contrast to the situation in metal--rich globular clusters and
elliptical galaxies. The metal--poor half of our sample ([Fe/H] $< 0$) shows
evidence for a mild Mg overenhancement ([Mg/Fe] $\sim +0.2$); but this is not
seen in the more metal--rich stars ([Fe/H] $\geq$ 0). The K giants in Baade's

will enable mock galaxy catalogues to be constructed with volumes as large as
those of the next generation of galaxy redshift surveys. Their algorithm,
however, neglects the coupling between long-wavelength linear modes and
short-wavelength non-linear modes. The growth of structure on small scales is
coupled to the amplitude of long-wavelength density perturbations via their
effect on the local value of the density parameter Omega_0.The effect of
neglecting this coupling is quantified using a set of specially tailored N-body
simulations. It is shown that the large-scale clustering of objects defined in
the evolved density field such as galaxy clusters is strongly underestimated by
their algorithm. An adaptation to their algorithm is proposed that, at the
expense of additional complexity, remedies the shortcomings of the original
one. Methods of constructing biased mock galaxy catalogues which utilise the
