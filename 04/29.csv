turnover $m^0_V$, with $\sim90\%$ completeness. From the amplitude of the
galaxy surface brightness fluctuations, we also estimate the number of globular
clusters fainter than this cutoff magnitude. The GCLFs of these galaxies are
well fitted by Gaussians; the weighted means of their turnover magnitudes and
dispersions are $\langle m^0_V\rangle = 23.88 \pm 0.10$ mag and
$\langle\sigma\rangle = 1.35\pm 0.07$ mag. The assumption of a universal value
for the absolute magnitude of the turnover $M^0_V$ places the Fornax cluster
$0.13 \pm 0.11$ mag more distant than Virgo. However, in light of recent
Cepheid and other high-precision distance measurements, as well as ongoing HST
observations of GCLFs for the purpose of determining the extra-galactic
distance scale, we choose to re-examine the universal GCLF hypothesis. Based on
data from groups and clusters of galaxies, we find evidence that $M^0_V$
becomes fainter as the local density of galaxies increases. We speculate on the
possible cause of this trend; if it is confirmed, GCLF observations will be
less useful for determining distances, but may provide important information
for constraining theories of star formation in primordial galaxy halos.

physical picture of the system implied by this formalism is that of a vacuum
state consisting in a background of RKKY-induced spin correlations, where two
kinds of elementary modes can be excited: Soft neutral modes associated with
deformations of the spin liquid, which lead to very large low-temperature
values of the heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility, and charged modes
corresponding to the excitation of electrons and holes in the system. Using the
translational and spin rotational symmetries, we construct a simple ansatz to
determine the charged excitations neglecting the effects of the spin
correlations. Apart from the `normal', uncorrelated states, we find strongly
correlated charged modes involving soft electrons (or holes) and spin
fluctuations, which strongly renormalize the low-energy charged spectrum, and
whose energy becomes negative beyond a critical coupling, signaling a vacuum
instability and a transition to a new phase.

weak binding of the quarks into meson, the analysis of the hadronic production
of mesons, containing $b$-quark, is performed, and a minimal transverse

meson differential spectrum can be reliably described in the model of
factorization of the hard $b$-quark production and the subsequent fragmentation
into the mesons. At low transverse momenta of the meson, nonfragmentational
contributions are essential. They are determined by the complete set of QCD

effect of destructive interference with the diagrams of fragmentation at

gauge QCD in the Mandelstam approximation. This involves a combination of
numerical and analytic methods: An asymptotic infrared expansion of the
solution is calculated recursively. In the ultraviolet, the problem reduces to
an analytically solvable differential equation. The iterative solution is then
obtained numerically by matching it to the analytic results at appropriate
points. Matching point independence is obtained for sufficiently wide ranges.
The solution is used to extract a non-perturbative beta-function. The scaling
behavior is in good agreement with perturbative QCD. No further fixed point for
positive values of the coupling is found which thus increases without bound in
the infrared. The non-perurbative result implies an infrared singular quark
interaction relating the scale Lambda of the subtraction scheme to the string
tension sigma.

establish recursion relations between singular vectors of different series and
at different levels. Thus, the N=2 singular vectors can be generated from a
smaller set of the so-called topological singular vectors, which are
distinguished by being in a 1:1 correspondence with singular vectors in affine

Overlapping branes arise after separating intersecting branes in a direction

Each pairwise overlap involves a membrane overlapping a membrane in a 0-brane,
a fivebrane overlapping a fivebrane in a 3-brane or a membrane overlapping a
