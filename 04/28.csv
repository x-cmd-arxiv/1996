spectrum and the Debye--Waller factor are taken into account. Monte Carlo
calculations are performed for body-centered cubic (bcc) crystals made of C, O,
Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Fe nuclei in the density range from $10^3$ to $10^{11}$
g cm$^{-3}$ at temperatures lower than the melting temperature but higher than
the temperature at which the Umklapp processes begin to be ""frozen out"". A
simplified method of calculation is proposed, which makes it possible to
describe the results in terms of simple analytic expressions, to extend these
expressions to any species of nucleus, and to consider face-centered cubic
(fcc) crystals. The kinetic coefficients are shown to depend tangibly on the
lattice type. The results are applicable to studies of heat transfer and
evolution of the magnetic field in the cores of white dwarfs and in the crusts
of neutron stars. The thermal drift of the magnetic field in the crust of a
neutron star is discussed.

will tend to have correlated flight times. We derive and discuss a correlation
function which describes this effect. This enables us to understand more fully
the operational significance of a fluctuating lightcone. Our results may be

focusing mostly on the ``boundary sine-Gordon model'' and its applications to
condensed matter physics. The first part of the review deals with formal
problems. We analyze the classical limit and perform semi-classical
quantization. We show that the non-relativistic limit corresponds to the
Calogero-Moser model with a boundary potential. We construct a lattice
regularization of the problem via the XXZ chain. We classify boundary bound
states. We generalize the Destri de Vega method to compute the ground state
energy of the theory on a finite interval. The second part deals with some
applications to condensed matter physics. We show how to compute analytically
time and space dependent correlations in one-dimensional quantum integrable
systems with an impurity. Our approach is based on a description of these
systems in terms of massless scattering of quasiparticles. Correlators follow
then from matrix elements of local operators between multiparticle states --
the massless form-factors. Although, in general an infinite sum of these
form-factors has to be considered, we find that for the current, spin and
energy operators only a few (two or three) are necessary to obtain an accuracy
of more than 1\%. Our results hold for arbitrary impurity strength, in contrary
to the perturbative expansions in the coupling constants. As an example, we
compute the frequency dependent condunctance, at zero temperature, in a
Luttinger liquid with an impurity, and also discuss the susceptibility in the
Kondo model and the time-dependent properties of the two-state problem with
dissipation.
