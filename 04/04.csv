"alg-geom/9604005","Carlos Simpson","Carlos Simpson","The Hodge filtration on nonabelian cohomology","LaTeX",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  This is partly a survey article on nonabelian Hodge theory, but we also give
proofs of results that have only been announced elsewhere. In the introduction
we discuss a wide range of recent work on this subject and give some
references. In the body of the paper, we discuss Corlette's nonabelian Hodge
theorem, Hitchin's quaternionic structure on the moduli space of
representations of $\pi _1(X)$ (for a compact K\""ahler manifold $X$), and
Deligne's construction of the resulting twistor space. We then mention the
interpretation of Deligne's space of $\lambda$-connections as the Hodge
filtration of the nonabelian de Rham cohomology $M_{DR}(X,G)= H^1(X,G)$. We go
on to prove several properties of this Hodge filtration, such as Griffiths
transversality and regularity of the Gauss-Manin connection; a local triviality
property coming from Goldman and Millson's analysis of the singularities; and a
weight property coming from Langton's theory. We construct a compactification
of $M_{DR}$ using the Hodge filtration with its weight property. At the end, we
define a nonabelian version of the Noether-Lefschetz locus, and prove that it
is algebraic if the base of the fibration is compact. We pose the open problem
of studying degenerations of nonabelian Hodge structure sufficiently well to be
able to prove algebraicity of the Noether-Lefshetz locus even when the base is
quasiprojective.

High signal-to-noise optical spectrophotometry at 5A resolution has been
obtained for the twenty-eight quasars easily accessible from the northern
hemisphere. These spectra have been surveyed to create new samples of high
redshift Lyman-limit systems, damped Lyman-alpha absorbers, and metal
absorption systems (e.g. CIV and MgII). In this paper we present the spectra,
together with line lists of the detected absorption systems. The QSOs display a
wide variety of emission and absorption line characteristics, with 5 exhibiting
broad absorption lines and one with extremely strong emission lines
(BR2248-1242). Eleven candidate damped Ly-alpha absorption systems have been
identified covering the redshift range 2.8<z<4.4 (8 with z>3.5). An analysis of
the measured redshifts of the high ionization emission lines with the low
ionization lines shows them to be blueshifted by 430+/-60 km/s. In a previous
paper (Storrie-Lombardi et. al. 1994) we discussed the redshift evolution of
the Lyman limit systems catalogued here. In subsequent papers we will discuss
the properties of the Ly-alpha forest absorbers and the redshift and column

taken with the VLA at 4.9~GHz (6~cm). The Seyfert galaxies were selected from a
distance-limited sample of 22 objects (defined in paper~I). The starburst
galaxies were selected to be well-matched to the Seyferts in radio power,
recessional velocity and inclination angle. All four starburst galaxies have a
very bright disk component and one (NGC~3044) has a radio halo that extends
several kpc out of the galaxy plane. Six of the ten Seyferts observed have
large-scale (radial extent $\gapprox$1 kpc) radio structures extending outward
from the nuclear region, indicating that large-scale outflows are quite common
in Seyferts. Large-scale radio sources in Seyferts are similar in radio power
and radial extent to radio halos in edge-on starburst galaxies, but their
morphologies do not resemble spherical halos observed in starburst galaxies.
The sources have diffuse morphologies, but, in general, they are oriented at
skewed angles with respect to the galaxy minor axes. This result is most easily
understood if the outflows are AGN-driven jets that are somehow diverted away
from the galaxy disk on scales $\gapprox$1 kpc. Starburst-driven winds,
however, cannot be ruled out. More observational work is needed to determine
whether massive star formation is present at high enough rates to drive
galactic winds out to kpc scales in Seyfert galaxies.

variations seen in globular cluster stars in a mixing scenario. Using detailed
stellar models together with an extensive nuclear reaction network, we have
calculated the distribution of the various isotopic abundances around the

calculations allow for the variation in both temperature and density in the
shell region as well as the timescale of the nuclear processing, as governed by
the outward movement of the hydrogen shell. The reaction network uses updated
rates over those of Caughlin \& Fowler (1988). We find evidence for the
production of Na and Al occurring in the NeNa and MgAl cycles. In particular,
Na is significantly enhanced throughout the region above the hydrogen shell.
The use of the newer reaction rates causes a substantial increase in the
production of $^{27}$Al above the hydrogen shell through heavy leakage from the
NeNa cycle and should have an important effect on the predicted surface
abundances. We also find that the nuclear processing is considerably more
extensive at lower metallicities.

(KS) regularization is widely used to remove the singularity in the equations
of motion, making it possible to integrate orbits having very high
eccentricity. However, even with KS regularization, long-term integration is
difficult, simply because the required accuracy is usually very high. We
present a new time-integration algorithm which has no secular error in either
the binding energy or the eccentricity, while allowing variable stepsize. The
basic approach is to take a time-symmetric algorithm, then apply an implicit
criterion for the stepsize to ensure strict time reversibility. We describe the
algorithm in detail and present the results of numerical tests involving
long-term integration of binaries and hierarchical triples. In all cases
studied, we found no systematic error in either the energy or the angular
momentum. We also found that its calculation cost does not become higher than
those of existing algorithms. By contrast, the stabilization technique, which
has been widely used in the field of collisional stellar dynamics, conserves
energy very well but does not conserve angular momentum.

operators in the $z$ plane. In order to exhibit the relevance of our study,
several applications to different cases of physical interest are discussed:
squeezed states and the relation between coherent states and theta functions on
one side, lattice quantum mechanics and Bloch functions on the other, are shown
to find a deeper mathematical understanding in terms of $q$-WH. The r\^ole
played by the finite difference operators and the relevance of the lattice
structure in the completeness of the coherent states system suggest that the
quantization of the WH algebra is an essential tool in the physics of
discretized (periodic) systems.

washout by sphaleron transitions, which can be avoided if the phase transition
is strongly enough first order. The phase transition in the Standard Model or
in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model seems to be too weak to suppress
the sphaleron transitions sufficiently. We report here on an investigation of
the Next to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, NMSSM, which contains a
Higgs singlet N in addition to the two Higgs doublets of the minimal SUSY
model. This next to minimal model has the helpful new feature that the Higgs
potential contains a tree level trilinear field term. We consider the most
general form of the Higgs potential without imposing a discrete symmetry; in
particular we allow the presence of a mu-term in the superpotential. We find
that electroweak baryon preservation is compatible with the NMSSM.

cohomology to an underlying gauge covariant algebra and reduces its computation
to a compactly formulated problem involving only suitably defined generalized

blocks of physically relevant quantities such as gauge invariant actions,
Noether currents and gauge anomalies, as well as of the equations of motion.

proofs in logic. We do this through the study of the Craig Interpolation
Theorem which is properly a statement about the structure of formal
derivations. We show that there is a generalization of the interpolation
theorem to much more naive structures about sets, and then we show how both
classical and intuitionistic versions of the statement follow by interpreting
properly the set-theoretic language.
  The theorem we present is a geometrical formulation of the well-known logical
statement and gives sufficient conditions for a system of combinatorial nature
to enjoy interpolation. Its objects might be graphs just as well as formulas or
surfaces.
  The combinatorial mappings we use correspond whenever interpreted in a
logical language to the notion of `logical flow graph' (i.e. a graph tracing
the flow of occurrences of formulas in a proof; this notion has been introduced
in (Buss, 1991). The idea of using the flow of occurrences to study the
structure of proofs was already present in (Girard, 1987) with the concept of
`proof net'.)
