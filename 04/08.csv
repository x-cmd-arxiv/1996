translation gauge field as a new tensor field. The effective metric tensor in
this case is hybrid of two tensor fields. In the linear approximation the
massive translation gauge field can give the Yukava type correction to the
Newtons potential. Also outer potentials of a sphere and ball of the same mass

The string like solution of the nonlinear equations of the translation gauge

the Riemann surface, with tension determined by a canonically fixed
Seiberg-Witten differential $\lambda$. This gives, effectively, a dual
formulation of Yang-Mills theory in which gauge bosons and monopoles are
treated on equal footing, and represents the rigid analog of type II-heterotic
string duality. The existence of BPS states is essentially reduced to a
geodesic problem on the Riemann surface with metric $|\lambda|^2$. This allows
us, in particular, to easily determine the spectrum of {\it stable} BPS states
in field theory. Moreover, we identify the six-dimensional space $\IR^4\times

to two-branes ending on this five-brane.
