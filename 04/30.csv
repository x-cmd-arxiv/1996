Einstein MPC spectrum. The cluster galaxies with emission lines in their
spectra have a larger velocity dispersion and are significantly less clustered
on this 2h^{-1} Mpc scale than galaxies without emission lines. We show that
excluding the emission line galaxies decreases the velocity dispersion by 18%
and the virial mass estimate by a factor of two. The central cluster region
contains a non--emission galaxy population and an intracluster medium which are
significantly cooler (sigma_{core}=387^{+250}_{-105}~km/s and
T_X=1.6^{+0.4}_{-0.3}~keV at 90\% confidence) than the global populations
(sigma=977^{+124}_{-96}~km/s for the non--emission population and T_X>4~keV at
90% confidence). Because (1) the low dispersion population is no more luminous
than the global population and (2) the evidence for a cooling flow is weak, we
suggest that the cluster core may contain the remnants of a lower mass
subcluster. We examine the cluster mass, baryon fraction and luminosity
function. The cluster virial mass varies significantly depending on the galaxy
sample used. Consistency between the hydrostatic and virial estimators can be
achieved if (1) the gas temperature at r\sim1h^{-1}~Mpc is T_X\sim8keV (the
best fit value) and (2) several velocity outliers are excluded from the virial
calculation. Although the best fit Schechter function parameters and the ratio
of galaxy to gas mass are typical of other clusters, the baryon fraction is
relatively low. Using a lower limit to the binding mass, we show that the gas
mass fraction is \le3h^{-3/2}% and the baryon fraction is \le6%.

radiation background on the formation of galaxies. In our highest resolution
simulations, we find that photoionization has essentially no effect on the
baryonic mass function of galaxies at $z=2$, down to our resolution limit of
$5e9 M_\sun$. We do, however, find a strong interplay between the mass
resolution of a simulation and the microphysics included in the computation of
heating and cooling rates. At low resolution, a photoionizing background can
appear to suppress the formation of even relatively massive galaxies. However,
when the same initial conditions are evolved with a factor of eight better mass
resolution, this effect disappears. Our results demonstrate the need for care
in interpreting the results of cosmological simulations that incorporate
hydrodynamics and radiation physics. For example, we conclude that a simulation
with limited resolution may yield more realistic results if it ignores some
relevant physical processes, such as photoionization. At higher resolution, the
simulated population of massive galaxies is insensitive to the treatment of
photoionization and star formation, but it does depend significantly on the
amplitude of the initial density fluctuations. By $z=2$, an $\Omega=1$ cold
dark matter model normalized to produce the observed masses of present-day
clusters has already formed galaxies with baryon masses exceeding $1e11

fainter at maximum light than the three previously known LMC RCB stars. The
amount of reddening toward these stars is somewhat uncertain but both seem to
have absolute magnitudes, M_V, about half a magnitude fainter than the other
three stars. Estimates of M_Bol find that the hot RCB star lies in the range of

result is the excellent fit of the 4.0 Gyr, [Fe/H] = $-0.10$ model to our data,
including a good fit to the main sequence (MS) turn-off. Our data are
consistent with a toy model with 50\% of the stars in M67 being binaries and a
random distribution of binary mass-ratios, although other models with different
mass-ratio distributions cannot be ruled out. The spatial distribution and mass
function (MF) of stars in M67 show marked effects of dynamical evolution and
evaporation of stars from the cluster. Blue stragglers and binary stars are the
most condensed within the cluster, with degree of condensation depending on
mass.We find M67 to have an elongated shape, oriented at an angle of
$15^{\circ}$ relative to the galactic plane. Within its tidal radius, the
observed MF of M67 between 1.2 $\rm M_\odot$ and $\rm 0.8 M_\odot$ has a
Salpeter slope $\rm \eta = -1.93 \pm 0.66$. For stars of mass below 0.8 $\rm
M_\odot$, $\rm \eta \sim 0$. It is plausible that the leveling-off of the MF at
lower masses is a result of evaporation of lower mass stars in this mass range
at a rate of one every $\sim 10^7$ years. If so, it is plausible that the IMF
of M67 has the canonical field value of $\rm \eta = -2.0$.

parallax and mass close to that of the cluster WDs have also been observed with
WFPC2. Matching the cluster and the local WD sequences provides a direct
measure of the distance to the cluster: $(m-M)_\circ=13.05$, with an
uncertainty less than $\pm0.1$ mag which allows a substantial reduction in the
uncertainty in the age of the cluster. Indeed, coupling this value of the
cluster distance to the cluster metallicity, helium abundance and
$\alpha$-element enhancement [$\alpha$/Fe]=0.5 yields an age of 15.5 Gyr and
14.5 Gyr using evolutionary models that do not include or do include helium
diffusion, respectively. The uncertainty affecting these age determinations is
$\sim 10\%$. The majority of the cluster WDs appear to be of the DA variety,
while the color-magnitude location of two WDs is consistent with the DB type.
This suggests a cluster DB/DA ratio similar to that of WDs in the solar

complicated dynamics, including dissipative chaos. For a range of values of the

nonzero residual density of zero-energy quasiparticle states N(0), leading to
characteristic low-temperature thermodynamic properties similar to those

vanishes, however. We perform exact calculations for d- and extended s-wave

Riemannian four-manifolds with boundary, within the framework of
$\zeta$-function regularization. The massless nature of gravitinos, jointly
with the presence of a boundary and a local description in terms of potentials
for spin ${3\over 2}$, force the background to be totally flat. First, nonlocal
boundary conditions of the spectral type are imposed on spin-${3\over 2}$
potentials, jointly with boundary conditions on metric perturbations which are
completely invariant under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms. The axial
gauge-averaging functional is used, which is then sufficient to ensure
self-adjointness. One thus finds that the contributions of ghost and gauge
modes vanish separately. Hence the contributions to the one-loop wave function
of the universe reduce to those $\zeta(0)$ values resulting from physical modes
only. Another set of mixed boundary conditions, motivated instead by local
supersymmetry and first proposed by Luckock, Moss and Poletti, is also
analyzed. In this case the contributions of gauge and ghost modes do not cancel
each other. Both sets of boundary conditions lead to a nonvanishing $\zeta(0)$
value, and spectral boundary conditions are also studied when two concentric
three-sphere boundaries occur. These results seem to point out that simple
supergravity is not even one-loop finite in the presence of boundaries.

each fermion is surrounded by infinite number of scalar monopoles. It is the

three-dimensional space, and find that those arguments are based on the global
topology, which is relatively trivial compared with the monopole structure.
Through a simple model, we formulate the three-dimensional anyon field
  using infinite number of Dirac's magnetic monopoles that change the ordinary
spacetime topology. The quasi-particle picture of the three-dimensional anyons
is quite similar to that of the usual two-dimensional anyons. However, the

reference to results for correlation functions involving conserved currents and
the energy momentum tensor. Ward identities resulting from conformal invariance
are discussed. Explicit expressions for two and three point functions, which
are essentially determined by conformal invariance, are obtained. As special
cases we consider the three point functions for two vector and an axial current
in four dimensions, which realises the usual anomaly simply and unambiguously,
and also for the energy momentum tensor in general dimension $d$. The latter is
shown to have two linearly independent forms in which the Ward identities are
realised trivially, except if $d = 4$, when the two forms become degenerate.
This is necessary in order to accommodate the two independent forms present in
the trace of the energy momentum tensor on curved space backgrounds for
conformal field theories in four dimensions. The coefficients of the two trace
anomaly terms are related to the three parameters describing the general energy
momentum tensor three point function. The connections with gravitational
effective actions depending on a background metric are described. A particular
form due to Riegert is shown to be unacceptable. Conformally invariant
expressions for the effective action in four dimensions are obtained using the
Green function for a differential operator which has simple properties under
local rescalings of the metric.
