barrier in an infinite well, that highly complex behavior of the time evolution
of a wave function is associated with the almost degeneracy of levels in the
process of tunneling. Degenerate conditions are obtained by shifting the
position of the barrier. The complexity strength depends on the number of
almost degenerate levels which depend on geometrical symmetry. The presence of
complex behavior is studied to establish correlation with spectral degeneracy.

percolation system is studied in the vicinity of the metal insulator
transition. In order to avoid the influence of small clusters, only regions of
the spectra in which the density of states is rather smooth are analyzed. Using
finite size scaling hypothesis, the critical quantum probability for bond
occupation is found to be $p_q=0.33\pm.01$ while the critical exponent for the
divergence of the localization length is estimated as $\nu=1.35\pm.10$. This
later figure is consistent with the one found within the universality class of
the standard Anderson model.

  rationality and exponential growth properties","28 pages",,,,"dg-ga math.DG",,"  In this paper we continue the study of generic properties of the Novikov
complex, began in the work ""The incidence coefficients in the Novikov complex
are generically rational functions"" ( dg-ga/9603006). For a Morse map $f:M\to
S^1$ there is a refined version of Novikov complex, defined over the Novikov
completion of the fundamental group ring. We prove that for a $C^0$ generic
$f$-gradient the corresponding incidence coefficients belong to the image in
the Novikov ring of a (non commutative) localization of the fundamental group
ring. The Novikov construction generalizes also to the case of Morse 1-forms.
In this case the corresponding incidence coefficients belong to the suitable
completion of the ring of integral Laurent polynomials of several variables. We
prove that for a given Morse form $\omega$ and a $C^0$ generic
$\omega$-gradient these incidence coefficients are rational functions. The
incidence coefficients in the Novikov complex are obtained by counting the
algebraic number of the trajectories of the gradient, joining the zeros of the
Morse form. There is V.I.Arnold's version of the exponential growth conjecture,
which concerns the total number of trajectories. We confirm it for any given
Morse form and a $C^0$ dense set of its gradients. We also give an example of
explicit computation of the Novikov complex.

  The reason for this phenomenological fit has been gained by working out a

$\bar \Lambda$ and $\mu_\pi^2$ (the mean value of the heavy quark three

precise CLEO data on the shape of the electron spectrum in semileptonic B meson
decays. The values obtained in \cite{GKLW}: $\bar \Lambda=(0.55\pm
0.05)\,GeV,\, \mu_\pi^2=(0.35\pm 0.05)\,GeV^2,$ disagree with the result
obtained earlier in \cite{CH} from the D meson semileptonic width.
  The purpose of this note is to show that the main reason for a disagreement
is the secondary electron background present in the data,\, which influences
strongly the extracted values of $\bar \lambda$ and $\mu_\pi^2$. We determine
the amount of this background from the selfconsistency conditions,\, and
subtract it out.
  As a result,\, the values of $\bar \Lambda$ and $\mu_\pi^2$ become a factor
two smaller and agree with \cite{CH}.

We discuss how to incorporate such corrections by using a new scaling variable
$\bar x(x,Q^2)$ which accounts for the non-perturbative effects due to the
confining parton interaction in the final state. The approach can accomodate
also the remaining QCD logarithmic corrections and the behaviour of the
$F_2(x,Q^2)$ structure functions is reproduced, in a quite natural way, within
a wide kinematical range.
