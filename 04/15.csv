scheme leads to a system with covariantly splitted and irreducible first and
second class constraints. Modified Lagrangian formulations for the
Green--Schwarz superstring, Casalbuoni--Brink--Schwarz superparticle and Siegel
superparticle, which reproduce the supplementation scheme, are suggested.

state. Familiar examples are the Sine-Gordon and the $\phi^4_2$-model. It is
known that these models possess states, called kink states, which interpolate
different vacua. A general construction scheme for kink states in the framework
of algebraic quantum field theory is developed in a previous paper. However,
for the application of this method, the crucial condition is the split property
for wedge algebras in the vacuum representations of the considered models. It
is believed that the vacuum representations of $P(\phi)_2$-models fulfill this
condition, but a rigorous proof is only known for the massive free scalar
field. Therefore, we investigate in a construction of kink states which can
directly be applied to $P(\phi)_2$-model, by making use of the properties of
the dynamic of a $P(\phi)_2$-model.

We state and prove two `insolubility theorems' that disappoint this hope. In
both the initial state of the apparatus is taken to be mixed rather than pure,
and the correlation of the object observable and the pointer observable is
allowed to be imperfect. In the {\it insolubility theorem for sharp
observables}, which is only a modest extension of previous results, the object
observable is taken to be an arbitrary projection valued measure. In the {\it
insolubility theorem for unsharp observables}, which is essentially new, the
object observable is taken to be a positive operator v alued measure. Both
theorems show that the measurement problem is not the consequence of neglecting
the ever-present imperfections of actual measurements.
