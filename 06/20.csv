on simulations of interacting cells with biochemical networks and cell division
process following consumption of some chemicals. According to the simulations
of the interaction-based dynamical systems model, the following scenario of the
cell differentiation is proposed. (1) Up to some threshold number, divisions
bring about almost identical cells with synchronized biochemical oscillations.
(2)As the number is increased the oscillations lose the synchrony, leading to
groups of cells with different phases of oscillations. (3)Amplitudes of
oscillation and averaged chemical compositions start to differ by groups of
cells. The differentiated behavior of states is transmitted to daughter cells.
(4)Recursivity is formed so that the daughter cells keep the identical chemical
character. This ``memory"" is made possible through the transfer of initial
conditions. (5) Successive differentiation proceeds. Mechanism of tumor cell
formation, origin of stem cells, anomalous differentiation by transplantations,
apoptosis and other features of cell differentiation process are also
discussed, with some novel predictions. (Keywords: differentiation, chemical

X-ray transients is reviewed. Seven of these systems have measured mass
functions or mass estimates in excess of stable neutron stars, making them
excellent black hole candidates. Two of them have revealed ``superluminal""
radio jets. Study of the hard and soft radiation from these sources has given
tight constraints on the physics of the viscosity of the accretion disk and
promises firm proof that these systems contain black holes. This will allow us
to search for black holes of more moderate mass and apply the knowledge of
these systems to suspected supermassive black holes in AGN's. The most
plausible mechanism for triggering the outburst of black hole candidate X-ray
transients is the ionization thermal instability. The disk instability models
can give the deduced mass flow in quiescence, but not the X-ray spectrum.
Advection models that can account for the quiescent X-ray spectrum are
difficult to match with the non-steady state, quiescent Keplerian disks.
Self-irradiation of the disk in outburst may not lead to X-ray reprocessing as
the dominant source of optical light, but may play a role in the ``reflare.""
The hard power-law spectrum and radio bursts may be non-thermal processes
driven by the flow of pair--rich plasma from the disk at early times and due to
the formation of a pair--rich plasma corona at late times. The repeated
outbursts in systems like GRO J0422+32 suggest some sort of clock, but it is
unlikely that it has anything to do with a simple X-ray heating of the
companion star. These systems typically have low mass secondaries and their
evolutionary origin is still mysterious.

mimics the fault friction by means of two fractional Brownian profiles (fBm)

the two profiles representing the two fault faces and its energy is assumed
proportional to the overlap surface. The SAM exhibits the Gutenberg-Richter law
with an exponent $\beta$ related to the roughness index of the profiles. Apart
from being analytically treatable, the model exhibits a non-trivial clustering
in the spatio-temporal distribution of epicenters that strongly resembles the
experimentally observed one. A generalized and more realistic version of the
model exhibits the Omori scaling for the distribution of the aftershocks. The
SAM lies in a different perspective with respect to usual models for
seismicity. In this case, in fact, the critical behaviour is not Self-Organized
but stems from the fractal geometry of the faults, which, on its turn, is
supposed to arise as a consequence of geological processes on very long time
scales with respect to the seismic dynamics. The explicit introduction of the
fault geometry, as an active element of this complex phenomenology, represents
the real novelty of our approach.

  We have used an exact numerical solution of the relativistic hydrodynamical
equations without free parameters which, because of its 3-d character,
constitutes a considerable improvement over the classical Landau solution.
  Using two different equations of state (eos) - one containing a phase
transition from QGP to the Hadronic Phase and two versions of a purely hadronic
eos - we find that the first one gives an overall better description of the
Au+Au experimental data at $AGS$ energies.

predictions for anti-protons, deltas, anti-deltas and hyperons. The low m_t
enhancement in pi- spectra is explained by baryon number conservation and
strangeness equilibration.
  We also find that negative kaon data are more sensitive to the eos, as well

phase transition in the forward rapidity region. Anti-protons, Omegas and heavy

perturbed by a non-topological, albeit gauge invariant, mass term. It is shown
that, in this limit, we may construct an infinite class of integrable quantum
mechanical models which, for the case of SU(2) group, are labelled by the
angular momentum eigenvalue. The first non-trivial example in this class is
obtained for the triplet representation and it physically describes the gauge
invariant coupling of a non-abelian Chern-Simons particle with a particle
moving on $S^3$ - the SU(2) group manifold. In addition to this, the model has
a fascinating resemblance to the Landau problem and may be regarded as a
non-abelian and a non-linear generalisation of the same defined on the
three-sphere with the uniform magnetic field replaced by an angular momentum
field. We explicitly solve for some eigenstates of this model in a closed form
in terms of some generalised orthogonal polynomials. In the process, we unravel
some startling connections with Anderson's chain models which are important in
the study of disordered systems in condensed matter physics. We also sketch a
method which allows us, in principle, to find the energy eigenvalues
corresponding to the above eigenstates of the theory if the Lyapunov exponents
of the transfer matrix of the infinite chain model involved are known.

isospin 0 or isospin 2 for the $d'$, our results give weigth to the isospin-2

simple solutions to demonstrate how the model unifies meson-meson scattering
with meson spectroscopy, thereby greatly extending the domain of applicability
of the naive quark model. In the limits of narrow resonance widths and no quark
exchange, it reproduces the standard quark model spectroscopy and Breit-Wigner
phase description. Outside those limits s-channel resonance masses are lowered
by their two-meson couplings, the line-shapes of wide resonances are
significantly altered, and the equivalent Breit-Wigner masses and widths show
an energy dependence. Because meson-meson interactions are due to coherent
s-channel resonance production and t-channel quark exchange (though other
interactions can readily be added), the multichannel equations model
experimental resonance production and decay in a way that the usual eigenvalue
equations cannot.

longitudinally boost-invariant geometries is studied as a function of the
initial energy density. The sensitivity of the collective flow pattern to
uncertainties in the nuclear matter equation of state is explored. We
concentrate on the effect of a possible finite width, $\Delta T \sim 0.1 T_c$,
of the transition region between quark-gluon plasma and hadronic phase.
Although slow deflagration solutions that act to stall the expansion do not
exist for $\Delta T > 0.08 T_c$, we find, nevertheless, that the equation of
state remains sufficiently soft in the transition region to delay the
propagation of ordinary rarefaction waves for a considerable time. We compute
the dependence of the pion-interferometry correlation function on $\Delta T$,
since this is the most promising observable for time-delayed expansion. The
signature of time delay, proposed by Pratt and Bertsch, is an enhancement of
the ratio of the inverse width of the pion correlation function in
out-direction to that in side-direction. One of our main results is that this
generic signature of quark-gluon plasma formation is rather robust to the
uncertainties in the width of the transition region. Furthermore, for
longitudinal boost-invariant geometries, the signal is likely to be maximized
around RHIC energies, $\sqrt{s} \sim 200$ AGeV.

input to soft photon calculations, is in certain cases required to be evaluated
outside of its physical phase space region. Also, for the case of two-body
identical particle bremsstrahlung processes, the symmetrized or antisymmetrized
form of these soft photon amplitudes cannot be written in terms of the

found that the usual Low form of the soft photon theorem is essentially
