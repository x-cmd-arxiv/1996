extremely red (R-K>6) objects. Little is known about the properties of these
objects on account of their optical faintness (R>24). Here, we report deep
infrared imaging and spectroscopy of one of the extremely red objects (EROs)
discovered by Hu \& Ridgway (1994) in the field of the z=3.79 quasar
PC1643+4631A. The infrared images were obtained in 0.5"" seeing, and show that
the object (denoted HR10) is not a dynamically relaxed elliptical galaxy
dominated by an old stellar population as was previously suspected, but instead
has an asymmetric morphology suggestive of either a disk or an interacting
system. The infrared spectrum of HR10 shows a single, possibly broad emission
feature at 1.60um which we identify as Halpha+[NII] at z=1.44. The luminosity
and width of this emission line indicates either intense star formation (about
20h^{-2} solar masses/yr) or the presence of an active nucleus. Based on the
rest frame UV-optical spectral energy distribution, the luminosity of HR10 is
estimated to be 3 to 8 L*. The colors of HR10 are unusually red for a galaxy
(at z=1.44 the age of HR10 is at most 2 to 8 Gyr depending on cosmology), and
indicate that HR10 is dusty. HR10 is detected weakly at radio wavelengths; this
is consistent with either the starburst or AGN hypothesis. If HR10 is a typical
representative of its class, EROs are numerous and represent a significant
component of the luminous objects in the Universe at z approx 1.5.

with the AUTOFIB fibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. Most
emission lines are spectrally resolved, yet all have dispersions sigma<100km/s.
Five of the 24 sample members have OII doublet line flux ratios which imply gas
densities in excess of 100 cm^-3. The line emission in these galaxies may be
dominated by an active nucleus and the galaxies have been eliminated from the
subsequent analysis. The remaining 19 linewidths are too large by a factor of
two (7sigma significance) to be attributed to turbulent motions within an
individual star forming region, and therefore most likely reflect the orbital
motion of ionized gas in the galaxy. We use Fabry--Perot observations of nearby
galaxies to construct simulated datasets that mimic our observational setup at
z=0.25; these allow us to compute the expected distribution of (observable)
linewidths sigma_v for a galaxy of a given ``true'' (optical) rotation speed
v_c. These simulations include the effects of random viewing angles, clumpy
line emission, finite fibre aperture, and internal dust extinction on the
emission line profile. We assume a linewidth--luminosity--colour relation: ln[
v_c(M_B,B-R) ] = ln[v_c(-19,1)] - eta*(M_B+10) + zeta*[(B-R)-1] and determine
the range of parameters consistent with our data. We find a mean rotation speed
of v_c(-19,1)=66+-8km/s (68% confidence limits) for the distant galaxies with
M_B=-19 and B-R=1, with a magnitude dependence for v_c of eta=0.07+-0.08, and a
colour dependence of zeta =0.28+-0.25. Through comparison with several local

coverage: the former captures the lexical ``atmosphere'' (discourse topic,

this complementarity by combining the two methods using decision lists. The
idea is to pool the evidence provided by the component methods, and to then
solve a target problem by applying the single strongest piece of evidence,
whatever type it happens to be. This paper takes Yarowsky's work as a starting
point, applying decision lists to the problem of context-sensitive spelling
correction. Decision lists are found, by and large, to outperform either
component method. However, it is found that further improvements can be
obtained by taking into account not just the single strongest piece of

improvements are demonstrated.

to use the Lagrangian Batalin-Vilkovisky and/or Hamiltonian

show that both formulations give an equivalent result. It leads to an

which classical orbits and path integrals for the motion of a point particle in
flat space can be transformed correctly into those in curved space. This
procedure evolved from well established methods in the theory of plastic
deformations where crystals with defects are described mathematically by
applying nonholonomic coordinate transformations to ideal crystals. In the
context of time-sliced path integrals, there seems to exists a quantum
equivalence principle which determines the measures of fluctating orbits in
spaces with curvature and torsion. The nonholonomic transformations produce a
nontrivial Jacobian in the path measure which in a curved space produces
  an additional term proportional to the curvature scalar canceling a similar
term found earlier by DeWitt from a naive formulation of Feynman's time-sliced
path integral. This cancelation is important in correctly describing
semiclassically and quantum mechanically various systems such as the hydrogen
atom, a particle on the surface of a sphere, and a spinning top. It is also
indispensible for the process of bosonization, by which Fermi particles are
redescribed in terms of Bose fields.
