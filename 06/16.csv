defects may well exist. The observation of such an entity would have enormous
significance for our understanding of fundamental physics. This paper points
out a novel observable signature of cosmic texture and global monopoles, namely
strong hot spots in the cosmic microwave anisotropy pattern on subdegree
scales. This signal should be readily detectable by the next generation of
anisotropy mapping experiments. The signature arises from overdensities in the
photon-baryon fluid generated by the gravitational attraction of the defects.
The angular power spectrum of the anisotropy fluctuations on subdegree scales
is also calculated, for cosmic string, global monopoles, and texture.

resolved into discrete points at the scale of the Planck length. We postulate
with the ""principle of the fermionic projector"" that physical equations must be
formulated intrinsically in discrete space-time with the projector on fermionic
states. This principle combines the Pauli principle, a local gauge principle
and the principle of relativity, but does not include a locality or causality
principle. It is shown that a well-established limit yields the structure of a
Lorentzian manifold. The equations of discrete space-time reduce to classical
field equations.

initial data for vacuum general relativity are studied numerically on $R^3$
with the interior of a standard torus cut out. By the choice of boundary
condition the torus is marginally outer trapped, and thus a surface of minimal
area. Apart from pure scaling the standard tori are parameterized by a radius
$a\in [0,1]$, where $a=0$ corresponds to the limit where the boundary torus
degenerates to a circle and $a=1$ to a torus that touches the axis of symmetry.
Noting that these tori are the orbits of a $U(1)\times U(1)$ conformal isometry
allows for a simple scheme to solve the constraint, involving numerical
solution of only ordinary differential equations.The tori are unstable minimal
surfaces (i.e. only saddle points of the area functional) and thus can not be
apparent horizons, but are always surrounded by an apparent horizon of
spherical topology, which is analyzed in the context of the hoop conjecture and
isoperimetric inequality for black holes.

proximity-focusing fine-mesh photomultipliers (Hamamatsu R2021). Results are
also obtained for scintillating fiber blocks of the same dimensions. Good
internal reflectivity of the bulk scintillator block resulted in resolutions
superior to the fibre blocks. A single-photon pulsed laser system was used to
study photomultipliers and the results were used in a Monte Carlo simulation of
the system to study the critical elements that determine the resolution.

`slow-roll' problem of inflation in supergravity. Such an inflationary scenario
can naturally emerge in theories with non-anomalous or anomalous U(1) gauge
symmetry. In the latter case the scale of inflation is fixed by the
Green--Schwarz mechanism of anomaly cancellation. The crucial point is that the
(super)gravity-mediated curvature of all the scalar fields (and, in particular,
of the inflaton), which in the standard F-dominated case is of the order of the
Hubble parameter, is absent in the D-term inflation case. The curvature of
moduli and of all other flat directions during such an inflation crucially
depends on their gauge charges.

found to be of the order of $10^{-15}{\rm MeV}$ for
$\Lambda_b\rightarrow\Lambda\gamma$ and $\Xi_b\rightarrow\Xi\gamma$ and of the
oder of $10^{-13}{\rm MeV}$ for $\Omega_b\rightarrow\Omega\gamma$. The

approximately $10^{-4}$.
