infinite-dimensional Grassmannians and determinant bundles (and therefore valid
for arbitrary base fields). As an application we construct the $\tau$-function
and formal Baker-Akhiezer functions over arbitrary fields, by proving the
existence of a ``formal geometry'' of local curves analogous to the geometry of
global algebraic curves.
  We begin by defining the functor of points, $\fu{\gr}(V,V^+)$, of the
Grassmannian of a $k$-vector space $V$ in such a way that its rational points
are precisely the points of the Grassmannian defined by Segal-Wilson, although
the points over an arbitrary $k$-scheme $S$ have been not previously
considered. This definition of the functor $\fu{\gr}(V,V^+)$ allows us to prove
that it is representable by a separated $k$-scheme $\gr(V,V^+)$. Using the
theory of determinants of Knudsen and Mumford, the determinant bundle is
constructed. This is one of the main results of the paper because it implies
that we can define ``infinite determinants'' in a completely algebraic way.

example, if the current catalogs extend to $z_{max}\sim 1$ and we live in a

The fraction of lines with $10<b<20$ \kms~is 17\%. The Doppler values derived
from uncontaminated \lyb~lines are smaller than those obtained from the
corresponding Ly$\alpha$ lines, indicating the contribution of non saturated,
non resolved components in the \lya~profiles. The integrated UV background
estimated from the proximity effect is found to be $J \sim 7 \times 10^{-22}$
erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$~Hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$. This value is consistent with
previous estimates obtained at a lower $z$, implying no appreciable redshift
evolution of the UVB up to $z=4$. 13 metal systems are identified, five of
which previously unknown. The analysis of the associated metal systems suggests
abundances generally below the solar value with an average [C/H] $\sim -0.5$.
This value is about one order of magnitude higher than that found in
intervening systems at about the same redshift. The analysis of the intervening
metal line systems has revealed in particular the presence of three optically
thin systems with $\log N_{HI}\sim 15$ showing associated CIV and SiIV
absorptions. In order to make the observed column densities consistent with
[Si/C] ratios lower than 10 times the solar value, it is necessary to assume a
large jump in the spectrum of the ionizing UV background beyond the HeII edge
($J_{912}/J_{228}\gsim 1000$). This result, if confirmed in other spectra at
the same redshift is suggestive of a possible dominance of a stellar ionizing
emissivity over the declining quasar one at $z > 3$.

redshifts planes at $z=0.64$ and $z=0.90$. The existence of two pairs of
background galaxies at different redshifts, almost superimposed on the same

different redshifts is developped for this purpose. Finally, [O II] equivalent
widths are used to compute approximate star formation rates which appear to be
of the same order of magnitude as in nearby spiral galaxies. The implications
on both the lensing properties of the cluster and the analysis of the field
galaxy evolution are also discussed.

multiply imaged systems or on weak lensing. There are two possible observable
effects, a static relative deflection of images or shear, and an induced time
dependent shift or proper motion. We evaluate the rms magnitude of these
effects for a COBE normalized, scale-invariant spectrum, which is an upper
limit on spectra produced by inflation. Previous work has shown that
large-scale structure may cause a relative deflection large enough to affect
observations, but we find that the corresponding effect of gravity waves is
smaller by $\sim 10^4$ and so cannot be observed. This results from the
oscillation in time as well as the redshifting of the amplitude of gravity
waves. We estimate the magnitude of the proper motion induced by deflection of
light due to large-scale structure, and find it to be $\sim 10^{-8}$ arcsec per
year. This corresponds to $\sim 50$ km/s at cosmological distances, which is
quite small compared to typical peculiar velocities. The COBE normalized
gravity wave spectrum produces motions smaller still by $\sim 10^2$. We
conclude that light deflection due to these cosmological perturbations cannot
produce observable proper motions of lensed images. On the other hand, there
are only a few known observational limits on a stochastic background of gravity
waves at shorter, astrophysical wavelengths. We calculate the expected
magnitudes of the effects of lensing by gravity waves of such wavelengths, and
find that they are too small to yield interesting limits on the energy density
of gravity waves.

in fluctuating media, initially developed for applications to electromagnetism
and neutron optics. In leading approximation this formalism leads to the usual
MSW effective hamiltonian governing neutrino propagation through a medium.
Next-to-leading contributions describe deviations from this description, which
arise due to neutrino interactions with fluctuations in the medium. We compute
these corrections for two types of fluctuations: ($i$) microscopic thermal
fluctuations, and ($ii$) macroscopic fluctuations in the medium's density.
While the first of these reproduces standard estimates, which are negligible
for applications to solar neutrinos, we find the second can be quite large,
since it grows in size with the correlation length of the fluctuation. We
consider two models in some detail. For fluctuations whose correlations are
extend only over a local region in space of length $l$, appreciable effects for
MSW oscillations arise if $(\delta n/n)^2 l\gsim 100$ m or so. Alternatively, a
crude model of helioseismic $p$-waves gives appreciable effects only when
$(\delta n/n) \gsim 1%$.
  In general the dominant effect is to diminish the quality of the resonance,
making the suppression of the ${}^7$Be neutrinos a good experimental probe of
fluctuations deep within the sun. Fluctuations can also provide a new mechanism
for reducing the solar neutrino flux, giving an energy-independent suppression
factor of $1/2$, away from the resonant region, even for small vacuum mixing
angles.

with a combination of a (constant) gravitational and a magnetic field. This has
been made possible by our finding of an exact solution to the problem, namely
the effective potential for the composite fermions. Then, from the
corresponding implicit equation the phase diagram for the dynamical fermion
mass is calculated numerically for some values of the magnetic field. %(what
can be done with arbitrary precision). For a small magnetic field the phase
diagram hints to the possibility of a second order phase transition at some
critical curvature. With growing magnetic field only the phase with broken
chiral symmetry survives, because the magnetic field prevents the decay of the
chiral condensate. This result is bound to have important consequences in early
universe cosmology.

adiabatic approximation and yields Berry's adiabatic phase. It is shown that
this series expansion has nothing to do with the $1/\tau$-expansion of

the existence of fundamental supermembranes is problematic, since they are
probably unstable. In this paper, we re-examine the quantum stability of
fundamental supermembranes in 11 dimensions. Previously, supermembranes were
shown to be unstable by approximating them with SU(n) super Yang-Mills fields
as $n \rightarrow \infty$. We show that this instability persists even if we
quantize the continuum theory from the very beginning. Second, we speculate how
a theory of decaying membranes may still be physically relevant. We present
some heuristic arguments showing that light membranes may be too short-lived to
be detected, while very massive membranes, with longer lifetimes, may have only
very weak coupling to the particles we see in nature. Either way, decaying
membranes would not be detectable in the lab. (This article is to be published
in Frontiers in Quantum Field Theory (World Scientific) dedicated to Keiji
Kikkawa's 60th birthday.)

quasi-gaussian shape of the total multiplicity distribution in the critical
range. The fixed-point property is also observed for the multiplicity of the
second bin. Fluctuations are studied using scaled factorial cumulants instead
of scaled factorial moments. The second-order cumulant displays the
intermittency signal while higher order cumulants are equal to zero, revealing
a large information redundancy in scaled factorial moments. A practical
criterion is proposed to identify the gaussian feature of light-fragment
production, distinguishing between a self-similarity mechanism (ERW) and the
superposition of independent sources (percolation).
