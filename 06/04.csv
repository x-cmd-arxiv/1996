computed using a recently developed relativistic hydrodynamic code (Duncan \&
Hughes 1994: ApJ, 436, L119) are presented. The radiation transfer calculations
were performed by assuming the flow is permeated by a magnetic field and fast
particle distribution in energy equipartition, with energy density proportional
to the hydrodynamic energy density (i.e., pressure). We find that relativistic
flows subject to strong perturbations exhibit a density structure consisting of
a series of nested bow shocks, and that this structure is evident in the
intensity maps for large viewing angles. However, for viewing angles
$<30^{\circ}$, differential Doppler boosting leads to a series of axial knots
of emission, similar to the pattern exhibited by many VLBI sources. The
appearance of VLBI knots is determined primarily by the Doppler boosting of
parts of a more extended flow. To study the evolution of a perturbed jet, a
time series of maps was produced and an integrated flux light curve created.
The light curve shows features characteristic of a radio loud AGN: small
amplitude variations and a large outburst. We find that in the absence of
perturbations, jets with a modest Lorentz factor ($\sim 5$) exhibit complex
intensity maps, while faster jets (Lorentz factor $\sim 10$) are largely
featureless. We also study the appearance of kiloparsec jet-counterjet pairs by
producing simulated maps at relatively large viewing angles; we conclude that
observed hot spot emission is more likely to be associated with the Mach disk
than with the outer, bow shock.

of the skewness and kurtosis is developed to describe the non-Gaussian
signatures in cosmologically interesting samples. Because the basis of the
discrete wavelet is compactly supported, the one-point distribution of the
father function coefficients (FFCs) taken from one realization is a good
estimate of the probability distribution function of the density if the ``fair
sample hypothesis"" holds. These FFC one-point distributions can also avoid the
constraints of the central limit theorem on the detection of non-Gaussianity.
Thus the FFC one-point distributions are effective in detecting non-Gaussian
behavior in samples such as non-Gaussian clumps embedded in a Gaussain
background, regardless of the number or density of the clumps. We demonstrate
that the non-Gaussianity can reveal not only the magnitudes but also the scales
of non-Gaussianity.
  Also calculated are the FFC one-point distributions, skewness and kurtosis
spectra for real data and linearly simulated samples of QSO Ly$\alpha$ forests.
When considering only second and lower order of statistics, such as the number
density and two-point correlation functions, the simulated data show the same
features as the real data. However, the the kurtosis spectra of samples given
by different models are found to be different. On the other hand, the spectra
of skewness and kurtosis for independent observational data sets are found to
be the same. Moreover, the real data are significantly different from the
non-Gaussianity spectrum of various posssible random samples. Therefore the
non-Gaussain spectrum is necessary and valuable for model discrimination.

excess of faint galaxies observed at intermediate redshifts. If this hypothesis
is correct, then intermediate redshift galaxies should rotate more slowly than
nearby galaxies with the same rest-frame luminosity. We present the results of
a survey of the internal kinematics of intermediate redshift (z = 0.25-0.45)
field galaxies to search for this effect. Using the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope, spatially-resolved spectra of the [O II] $\lambda\lambda$ 3726- 3729
\AA doublet emission line have been obtained for 22 galaxies. V$_{\rm rot} $
sin i and [O II] disk scale lengths have been extracted from each galaxy
spectrum using a Bayesian fitting technique.
  Galaxies in the sample are found to be $\sim$1.5-2.0 mag brighter than
expected from their rotation velocity and the local Tully-Fisher (TF) relation.
Low-mass galaxies exhibit a wider range of evolution relative to the TF
relation than high-mass galaxies. The main source of uncertainty in this result
is the large scatter in the local TF relation for late-type galaxies.
Luminosity-dependent luminosity evolution neatly reconciles the lack of
evolution seen in other works with the results of our survey. It is also found
that the overall properties of [OII] kinematics at intermediate redshifts are
varied. For example, 25% of the field galaxies in the sample have [OII]
kinematics unrelated to rotation; [OII] emission is confined to the nucleus in
most of these galaxies. Anomalous kinematics is found to be related to the
presence of companions -- i.e. minor merger events. A Doppler ellipse similar
to those found in local dwarf galaxies has been observed in a z = 0.35 galaxy,
and may be interpreted as a supernova-driven supershell.

Blandford \& McKee 1982) have assumed that the emission characteristics of
illuminated clouds are purely a function of the instant continuum flux to which
they are exposed. This paper shows that this assumption is not necessarily
justified and that the history of exposure accounting for ``local delays"" due
to finite cloud equilibrium times can also be relevant. For this reason, a new
formalism is developed in this paper for computing the observational properties
of models which have local delays. The nature of the nonlinear behavior that
results is calculated for some very simple nonlinear cloud line emission
models. It is found that the mean response time is a function of the recent
average value of the continuum. Linear models fit to these nonlinear systems
respond too slowly when there are low-energy (and generally rapid) changes in
the continuum, yet respond too rapidly when there are high-energy (and
generally slow) changes in the continuum. As with systems without local delays,
the expression for the time-dependent line flux contains an integration over
history of the ``spatial"" response function, which has structure at lags of the
light travel times of the emission region. However, the kernel of this integral
itself is a function of additional integrations over individual ``cloud""
response functions which have structure at lags of the equilibrium times of the
cloud properties relevant to line emission. If instantaneous or linear response
is incorrectly assumed, local delays and nonlinear response can make a system
appear larger than it actually is. These effects are similar to those that
beaming can cause. Local delays can also be a source of asymmetry about the
peak of the cross-correlation function.

transients based on the diversity of accretion disk models is introduced.
Depending on the mass accretion rate, it is proposed that the accretion disk is
described by one or a combination of the following structures: optically thick
disk, advection-dominated disk, corona-disk, and non-steady state disk. In
particular, it is suggested that the very high, high, low, and off states are
characterized by mass accretion rates of decreasing magnitude. The very high
state corresponds to mass accretion rates near the Eddington limit in which an
optically thin non steady inner region is surrounded by an optically thick
structure. In the high state, the inner region is optically thin and
advection-dominated or optically thick. The low hard state is interpreted in
terms of a disk-corona system and the off state in terms of an optically thin
disk dominated by advective energy transport into the black hole. The possible
observational consequences of such a paradigm are discussed.

exceeds the number of events (1.1) and the microlensing optical depth predicted

consistent with models in which about half of the standard dark halo mass is

be a binary lensing event with a caustic crossing that is partially resolved

not a short period binary star, then we show that the lens system is very
likely to reside in the LMC. However, if we assume that the optical depth for

the binary event does not appear to be consistent with lensing of a single LMC

This result also allows to estimate the aperture corrections to the millimetric

compare the broad-band FIR/mm spectra with a simple dust model. According to
their far-IR/mm spectrum, the sample galaxies show a dichothomy: almost half of

believe these data provide an exhaustive and unbiased view of dust properties

the continuum limit, this system is described in term of two coupled level-1
WZW field theories. We illustrate its equivalence with four off-critical Ising
models (Majorana fermions). This description is used to investigate the opening
of a gap as a function of $\kappa_1$ and the associated spontaneous breakdown
of parity. We calculate the dynamic spin structure factor near the wavevectors
accessible to the continuum limit. We comment on the nonzero string order
parameter and show the presence of a hidden ${\Bbb Z}_2\times{\Bbb Z}_2$
symmetry via a nonlocal transformation on the microscopic Hamiltonian. For a
ferromagnetic interchain coupling, the model is conjectured to be critical,
with different velocities for the spin singlet and spin triplet excitations.

the background geometry is treated as a perturbed Schwarzschild spacetime with
the angular momentum per unit mass playing the role of a perturbative

wave equation yields two coupled one-dimensional evolution equations for a
function representing the scalar field in the Schwarzschild background and a
second field that accounts for the rotation. Solutions to the wave equation are
also obtained for rapidly rotating black holes. In this case, the wave equation
does not admit complete separation of variables and yields a two-dimensional

scalars in a De Sitter spacetime background. After providing a practical
definition of the rate, we focus on the case of an inflaton interacting with a

The evolution equation for the expectation value of the inflaton is obtained to
one loop order in perturbation theory and the decay rate is recognized from the
solution. We find the remarkable result that this decay rate displays an
equilibrium Bose-enhancement factor with an effective temperature given by the
Hawking temperature $H\slash{2 \pi}$, where $H$ is the Hubble constant. This
contribution is interpreted as the ``stimulated emission'' of bosons in a
thermal bath at the Hawking temperature. In the context of new inflation
scenarios, we show that inflaton decay into conformally coupled massless fields
slows down the rolling of the expectation value. Decay into Goldstone bosons is
also studied. Contact with stochastic inflation is established by deriving the
Langevin equation for the coarse-grained expectation value of the inflaton
field to one-loop order in this model. We find that the noise is gaussian and
correlated (colored) and its correlations are related to the dissipative
(``decay'') kernel via a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation.

to stabilize the dilaton but not so large as to disturb the
coupling--unification relations. Bearing this in mind, as well as the smallness

consequences of a previously suggested extension of the MSSM spectrum are
explored. The extension contains two vector--like families of quarks and

of ${\bf 16}+{\bf \overline{16}}$ of $SO(10)$. It is observed that such an

relatively low value of $\alpha_3(m_Z)$, in accord with its world average

longitudinal polarization in the C.M. frame decreases by a 4% for $D^+

fact that the polarization is a Lorentz variant quantity, we study the
polarization effects in a boosted frame. By means of a neutrino beam, produced
by a high velocity boosted parent able to flip the neutrino helicity, we find
that an enhanced left-handed neutrino deficit, induced by a Wigner rotation,
appears.
