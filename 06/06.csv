demonstrate that the strong CIV system at z=2.08 spanning more than 1500 km/s
is made up of narrow components with typical Doppler parameter b=8 km/s. The
gas is probably photo-ionized in which case the photo-ionizing spectrum should
be dominated by stellar radiation. Analysis of HI, SiIV, NV and CIV absorptions
shows that the gas has a fairly large metal content, Z>0.1Zsolar. We detect
CII*1335 absorption in subcomponents of the z=2.133 system, which have moderate
total CII column densities implying an electronic density of ne=3/cm3. In
addition, the weakness of the OI1302, SiII1304 and FeII1608 lines allows a
detailed analysis of the line profiles. The results are that the system has
four narrow (b=10km/s) components; the oxygen abundance is of the order of 0.03
solar; the iron abundance is surprisingly large [Fe/O]=[Fe/O]solar+0.3. If
photo-ionized by the UV flux from the quasar, the distance between the absorber
and the quasar should be larger than 0.3 Mpc. This demontrates that the gas is
not associated with the quasar and, together with the detection of eight
multiple metal systems between z=1.91 and 2.13, suggests the presence of a
coherent structure extended over 80 Mpc along the line of sight.

describe the coarse grained evolution of discrete lattice models and analyze

advantages of this formulation of growth processes is that it allows one to go
beyond the frequently used no-overhang approximation. The reparametrization
invariant form also displays explicitly the conservation laws for the specific
process and all the symmetries with respect to space-time transformations which
are usually lost in the small gradient expansion. Finally, it is observed, that

allows the emergence of unstable relationships. In parallel to regular actors

experiments. Via a process of elimination, $B(D^0 \rightarrow K^- \pi^+ )$ is
identified as the culprit. It calibrates essentially all charmed meson
production and decay properties, and thus is central to the physics of heavy
flavors. We predict it to decrease significantly below currently accepted
values. We suggest several novel methods for precise measurements of $B(D^0
\rightarrow K^- \pi^+ )$. The $B(\Lambda_c \rightarrow pK^-\pi^+)$, on the
other hand, calibrates heavy-flavored baryons. Its world average relies heavily
on a model of baryon production in $B$ decays, which would be invalidated if
$\overline B\rightarrow D^{(*)} \stackrel{(-)}{N} X$ processes were found to be
significant. A Dalitz-plot analysis explains naturally the soft inclusive
$\Lambda_c$ momentum spectrum in $\overline B$ decays, and predicts sizable
$\overline B\rightarrow D^{(*)}\stackrel{(-)}{N} X$ processes. Consistently
carrying through these modifications to charmed meson and baryon yields has the
potential to resolve the heavy-flavor puzzles at $Z^0$-factories [$R_c,\;
R_b$], the number of charm per $B$-decay puzzle, and the semi-leptonic $B$
decay puzzles. We emphasize that state of the art theoretical calculations are

satisfy. Another topic of this report concerns the $b\rightarrow c + \overline

realization of enlarged hidden local symmetry is accomplished via the
introduction of two kinds of ``compensating'' fields. For obtaining the
intrinsic-parity violating part of the action, we generalize the standard
gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten action such that it also contains two kinds of
``compensators'' in addition to the usual Goldstone bosons as well as the

means that $G_{local}$ has no gauge anomaly and its associated vector and
axial-vector mesons can be regarded as gauge bosons of $G_{local}$. The
introduction of the coupling with the external electroweak fields requires us
to gauge some appropriate subgroup of $G_{global}$. To perform it in consistent
with the anomaly structure of QCD is a nontrivial problem. We explain how this
can be done, following the recent suggestion by several authors.

general (one-loop) Virasoro construction in the operator algebra of the general
non-linear sigma model. The result is a unified Einstein-Virasoro master
equation which couples the spacetime spin-two field $L^{ab}$ to the background
fields of the sigma model. For a particular solution $L_G^{ab}$, the unified
system reduces to the canonical stress tensors and conventional Einstein
equations of the sigma model, and the system reduces to the general
affine-Virasoro construction and the VME when the sigma model is taken to be
the WZW action. More generally, the unified system describes a space of
conformal field theories which is presumably much larger than the sum of the
general affine-Virasoro construction and the sigma model with its canonical
stress tensors. We also discuss a number of algebraic and geometrical
properties of the system, including its relation to an unsolved problem in the
theory of $G$-structures on manifolds with torsion.

state of a D-brane in perturbative string theory. The hair manifests itself as
a phase (more generally a unitary matrix in subspaces of degenerate string
eigenstates) in the scattering amplitudes of elementary strings on the D brane.
As the separation of the D-brane and the string center of mass becomes large,
the phase goes to zero if we keep the string excitation level fixed. However,
by letting the level number increase with the distance, we can keep the phase
constant. We argue that this implies that scattering experiments with highly
excited strings can detect the state of a D-brane long after it has ``fallen
into a black hole'' .

variants of the first-order Dirac--Fierz equations for zero rest-mass fields of

constructed by an iterative procedure. In (arbitrarily extended) chiral

unitary transformation to a model Lagrangian with $N,\Delta,\pi$, $\rho$,
$\omega$, and $\gamma$ fields. With appropraite phenomenological form factors
and coupling constants for $\rho$ and $\Delta$, the model can give a good
description of $\pi N$ scattering phase shifts up to the $\Delta$ excitation
energy region. It is shown that the best reproduction of the recent LEGS data
of the photon-asymmetry ratios in $\gamma p \rightarrow \pi ^0 p$ reactions
provides rather restricted constraints on the coupling strengths $G_E$ of the
electric $E2$ and $G_M$ of the magnetic $M1$ transitions of the bare $\Delta
\leftrightarrow \gamma N$ vertex and the less well-determined coupling constant
$g_{\omega NN}$ of $\omega$ meson. Within the ranges that $G_M = 1.9 \pm 0.05$,
$G_E = 0.0 \pm 0.025$, and $7 \leq g_{\omega NN}\leq 10.5$, the predicted
differential cross sections and photon-asymmetry ratios are in an overall good
agreement with the data of $\gamma p \rightarrow \pi ^0 p$, $\gamma p
\rightarrow \pi ^+ n$, and $\gamma n\rightarrow \pi ^- p$ reactions from 180
MeV to the $\Delta$ excitation region. The predicted $M_{1^+}$ and $E_{1^+}$
multipole amplitudes are also in good agreement with the empirical values
determined by the amplitude analyses. The constructed effective Hamiltonian is
free of the nucleon renormlization problem and hence is suitable for nuclear
many-body calculations. We have also shown that the assumptions made in the
$K$-matrix method, commonly used in extracting empirically the $\gamma N
