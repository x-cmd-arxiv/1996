clusters (z < 0.15), each of which has at least 30 available galaxy redshifts,

nonparametric methods. In the estimate of galaxy velocity dispersion we
consider the effects of possible velocity anisotropies in galaxy orbits, the
infall of late-type galaxies, and velocity gradients. The dynamical
uncertainties due to the presence of substructures are also taken into account.
  Our cumulative distribution agrees with previous distributions within their
completness in velocity dispersion ( > 800 km/s). We estimate that our
distributions is complete for at least a dispersion greater than 650 km/s. In
this completeness range a power law fit is in fair agreement with results
coming from the X-ray temperature distributions.

in which a significant fraction of disk stars lie on retrograde orbits; an
identical analysis of NGC~4550 does reveal the previously-known
counter-rotating stellar disk in this system. Upper limits determined for each
object indicate that no more than about 5% of the observed disk star light
could arise from counter-rotating stellar components. These results suggest
that previously-discovered disk galaxies with counter-rotating stars are
exceptional and that (at 95% confidence) at most 10% of S0 galaxies contain
significant counter-rotating populations. The most likely value for the
fraction of such S0 galaxies lies closer to 1%. This result contrasts with the
prevalence of counter-rotating gas in these systems; combining our new
observations with existing data, we find that 24+/-8% (1-sigma error) of the
gas disks in S0 galaxies counter-rotate relative to their stellar components.

diffusion of the colloidal particles out of cages formed by their neighbors, on
the P\'{e}clet time scale $\tau_P$, the dominant physical process in
concentrated colloidal suspensions. The Newtonian viscosity $\eta_N(\phi) =
\eta(\phi,\omega = 0)$ agrees very well with the extensive experiments of Van

of the form $\eta_{\infty}(\phi) + A(\phi)(\omega \tau_P)^{-1/2}$, in agreement

conductance, caused by the randomness in the concentration. If the
concentration changes slowly on the scale of the Fermi wavelength, its prime
role reduces to the scattering of the plasmon waves, propagating along the
system. As a result of such a scattering, plasmons get localized. We show that
the localization length, $l_{\omega}$, of a plasmon with frequency $\omega$ is
inverse proportional to the square of the interaction strength and changes with
frequency as $l_{\omega}\propto \omega^{-2}$. If the relative variation of the
concentration is small, the randomness--induced correction to the tunnel
conductance, $\delta G(V)$, where $V$ is the applied bias, can be expressed
through the spectral characteristics of the localized plasmons. The magnitude
of the correction, $(\overline{ \delta G^2})^{1/2}/ G$, increases with $V$ as
$\sqrt V$. The typical period of the fluctuations in $\delta G(V)$ is of the
order of $V$. At a fixed $V$, the correlator of $\delta G$ at different points

theories admitting an extra (conformal) symmetry are the models with an
exponential potential $V \propto e^{\beta\phi}$ ($ S ={1\over2\pi} \int d^2 x
\sqrt{-g} [ R \phi + 4 \lambda^2 e^{\beta\phi} ]$), which include the CGHS
model as a particular though limiting ($\beta=0$) case. These models give rise
to black hole solutions with a mass-dependent temperature. The underlying extra
symmetry can be maintained in a natural way in the one-loop effective action,
thus implying the exact solubility of the semiclassical theory including
back-reaction. Moreover, we also introduce three different classes of
(non-conformal) transformations which are extra symmetries for generic 2D
dilaton gravity models. Special linear combinations of these transformations
turn out to be the (conformal) symmetries of the CGHS and $V \propto
e^{\beta\phi}$ models. We show that one of the non-conformal extra symmetries
can be converted into a conformal one by means of adequate field redefinitions
involving the metric and the derivatives of the dilaton. Finally, by expressing
the Polyakov-Liouville effective action in terms of an invariant metric, we are
able to provide semiclassical models which are also invariant. This generalizes
the solvable semiclassical model of Bose, Parker and Peleg (BPP) for a generic
