modes during non-linear evolution of gravitational clustering in an expanding
universe. We start with a power spectrum of density fluctuations that is
exponentially damped outside a narrow range of scales and use numerical
simulations to study evolution of this power spectrum. Non-Linear effects
generate power at other scales with most power flowing from larger to smaller
scales. The ``cascade'' of power leads to equipartition of energy at smaller
scales, implying a power spectrum with index $n\approx -1$. We find that such a
spectrum is produced in the range $1 < \delta < 200$ for density contrast
$\delta$. This result continues to hold even when small scale power is added to
the initial power spectrum. Semi-analytic models for gravitational clustering
suggest a tendency for the effective index to move towards a critical index
$n_c\approx -1$ in this range. For n<n_c, power in this range grows faster than
linear rate, while if n>n_c, it grows at a slower rate - thereby changing the
index closer to n_c. At scales larger than the narrow range of scales with
initial power, a k^4 tail is produced. We demonstrate that non-linear small
scales do not effect the growth of perturbations at larger scales.

  Computational Linguistics), Santa Cruz",,,"cmp-lg cs.CL",,"  Under categorial grammars that have powerful rules like composition, a simple
n-word sentence can have exponentially many parses. Generating all parses is
inefficient and obscures whatever true semantic ambiguities are in the input.
This paper addresses the problem for a fairly general form of Combinatory
Categorial Grammar, by means of an efficient, correct, and easy to implement
normal-form parsing technique. The parser is proved to find exactly one parse
in each semantic equivalence class of allowable parses; that is, spurious
ambiguity (as carefully defined) is shown to be both safely and completely
eliminated.

string tension agree to within the statistical errors of the monopole
calculation.
