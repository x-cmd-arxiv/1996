with the VLA at 20 cm and 3.6 cm. The quasar was detected at both frequencies
(\approx 0.7 mJy) with a flat spectrum. All four lensed images are clearly
resolved at 3.6 cm, and the agreement of the radio and optical image positions
is excellent. No radio emission is detected from the lensing galaxy, and any
fifth lensed quasar image must be fainter than \sim 20% of the A image flux
density. Since the optical quasar images are variable and susceptible to
extinction, radio flux ratios provide the best measurement of the macrolensing
magnification ratios. The radio B/A and C/A image flux ratios are consistent
with the observed range of optical variations, but the D/A ratio is
consistently higher in the radio than in the optical. The radio ratios are
consistent with magnification ratios predicted by lens models, and weaken
alternative interpretations for Q2237+0305. More accurate radio ratios can
distinguish between the models, as well as improve our understanding of both
microlensing and extinction in this system.

$\langle L_z \rangle$ around the proton spin axis. A fit to the baryon magnetic

family of supersymmetric toroidal 3-cycles. Moreover the moduli space of such
cycles together with their flat connections is precisely the space $Y$. The
mirror transformation is equivalent to T-duality on the 3-cycles. The geometry
of moduli space is addressed in a general framework. Several examples are
discussed.

symmetric generalized Cartan matrix as a set of Lagrangian subvarieties of the
cotangent bundle of the quiver variety. As a by-product, we give a
counterexample to the conjecture of Kazhdan--Lusztig on the irreducibility of
the characteristic variety of the intersection cohomology sheaves associated
with the Schubert cells of type A and also to the similar problem asked by
Lusztig on the characteristic variety of the perverse sheaves corresponding to
canonical bases.
