more than the number expected ($\sim 1.1$) from lensing by known stellar

be compared with the optical depth predicted for a ``standard"" halo composed
entirely of Machos: $\tau_{halo} = 4.7\ten{-7}$. Likelihood analysis gives a
fairly model independent estimate of the halo mass in Machos within 50 kpc of
$2.0^{+1.2}_{-0.7} \ten{11} \msun$, about half of the ``standard halo"" value.
We also find a most probable Macho mass of $0.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\msun$, although
this value is strongly model dependent. Additionally, the absence of short
duration events places stringent upper limits on the contribution of low-mass
Machos: objects from $10^{-4} \msun$ to $0.03 \msun$ contribute $\simlt 20\%$
of the ``standard"" dark halo.

arising from the vacuum being subjected to a relativistic exponential scale

versus thermal fluctuations (noise) between the two vacua. This approach can
treat conditions which the geometric approach cannot, such as systems which do
not even have an event horizon. An example is the case of an observer whose
acceleration is nonuniform or only asymptotically uniform. Since this approach
is based on concepts and techniques of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics,
it is more adept to dynamical problems, such as the dissipation, fluctuation,

these can be understood as arising from the vacuum fluctuations of the quantum
field being subjected to an exponential scale transformation. This viewpoint,
together with our recently developed stochastic theory of particle-field
interaction understood as quantum open systems described by the influence
functional formalism, can be used to address situations where the spacetime
possesses an event horizon only asymptotically, or none at all. Examples
studied here include detectors moving at uniform acceleration only
asymptotically or for a finite time, a moving mirror, and a collapsing mass. We
show that in such systems radiance indeed is observed, albeit not in a precise
Planckian spectrum. The deviation therefrom is determined by a parameter which
measures the departure from uniform acceleration or from exact exponential
expansion. These results are expected to be useful for the investigation of
non-equilibrium black hole thermodynamics and the linear response regime of
backreaction problems in semiclassical gravity.

to the ratio of symmetry breaking scales present in the model. We first argue
that for the R-parity violating couplings $\lambda_{R\!\!\!/}$ to be suppressed
to the desired level, the $B-L$ local symmetry must break at an intermediate
scale $M_{B-L}$ since $\lambda_{R\!\!\!/} =M_{B-L}/M_{GUT}$. We then construct
scenarios where such intermediate scales arise being consistent with gauge
coupling unification in a two-loop renormalization group study. In the
resulting $SO(10)$ models, higher-dimensional-operator-induced R-parity
violating couplings are potentially large (except in one case), and are
therefore inconsistent with limits on the proton life time unless the couplings
associated with the higher dimensional terms are fine tuned to very small
values. However, the $[SU(3)]^3$ and $G_{224}$ models can be consistent if a
certain class of quark-lepton coupling in the superpotential is forbidden by a
discrete summetry (unrelated to R-parity). An interesting prediction of these

remain unregularized by the scheme. Since the invariant scheme is promoted to
also include local Lorentz invariance, spectator fields which do not couple to
gravity cannot be, and are not, introduced. Furthermore, the scheme is truly
chiral (Weyl) in that all fields, including the regulators, are left-handed;
and only the left-handed spin connection is needed. The scheme is, therefore,
well suited for the study of the interaction of matter with all four known
forces in a completely chiral fashion. In contrast with the vectorlike

non-perturbative phenomena from the point of view of heterotic string theory.
Although the orientifold models are a natural setting in which to study these
non-perturbative Heterotic string phenomena, it is interesting and instructive
to explore how such vacua are realised in Heterotic string theory, M-theory and
F-theory, and consider the relations between them. In particular, we consider
models of M-theory compactified on K3 x S^1/Z_2 with fivebranes present on the
interval. There is a family of such models which yields the same spectra as a
subfamily of the orientifold models. By further compactifying on T^2 to four
dimensions we relate them to Heterotic string spectra. We then use
Heterotic/Type IIA duality to deduce the existence of Calabi-Yau 3-folds which
should yield the original six dimensional orientifold spectra if we use them to
compactify F-theory. Finally, we show in detail how to take a limit of such an
F-theory compactification which returns us to the Type IIB orientifold models.

; \sum_{j=1}^n |z_j|^{2m_j}<1 \}$, where $m=(m_1,\ldots,m_n) \in \Natl^n$ and
$m_n \neq 1$. Let $z^0 \in \partial \ellip$ be any weakly pseudoconvex point,
$k \in \Natl$ the degenerate rank of the Levi form at $z^0$. An explicit
formula for $K^B(z)$ modulo analytic functions is given in terms of the polar
coordinates $(t_1, \ldots, t_k, r)$ around $z^0$. This formula provides
detailed information about the singularities of $K^B(z)$, which improves the
result of A. Bonami and N. Lohou\'e \cite{bol}. A similar result is established
also for the Szeg\""o kernel $K^S(z)$ of $\ellip$.

"math/9606215",,"J. Maurice Rojas","Toric Intersection Theory for Affine Root Counting",,,,"MSRI 1996-051","math.AG",,"  Given any polynomial system with fixed monomial term structure, we give
explicit formulae for the generic number of roots with specified coordinate
vanishing restrictions. For the case of affine space minus an arbitrary union
of coordinate hyperplanes, these formulae are also the tightest possible upper
bounds on the number of isolated roots. We also characterize, in terms of
sparse resultants, precisely when these upper bounds are attained. Finally, we
reformulate and extend some of the prior combinatorial results of the author on
which subsets of coefficients must be chosen generically for our formulae to be
exact.
  Our underlying framework provides a new toric variety setting for
computational intersection theory in affine space minus an arbitrary union of
coordinate hyperplanes. We thus show that, at least for root counting, it is
better to work in a naturally associated toric compactification instead of
always resorting to products of projective spaces.

realized by the mixing of axial-vector ($1^+$) mesons in a single-meson
exchange picture. The Coleman-Glashow scheme for $\Delta I_{z}=1$ charge
symmetry breaking applied to meson and baryon $SU(2)$ mass splittings suggests
a universal scale. This scale can be extended to $\Delta I=1$ nonstrange CSB
transitions $\langle a_1^\circ|H_{em}|f_1\rangle$ of size $-0.005$ GeV$^2$. The
resulting nucleon-nucleon axial-vector meson exchange CSB potential then
predicts $\Delta I=1$ effects which are small.

especially but not exclusively for people who want to learn something about the
canonical approach to quantum gravity, which is however not included in these
lectures. They are about Dirac's general method to construct a quantum theory
out of a classical theory, which has to be defined in terms of a Lagrangian.
The classical Hamiltonian formalism is reviewed, with emphasis on the relation
between constraints and gauge symmetries, and quantization is carried out
without any kind of gauge fixing. The method is applied to three examples: the
free electro-magnetic field, the relativistic point particle, and the very
first steps of string theory are carried out.
