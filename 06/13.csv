effective way of measuring galaxy luminosity functions at faint magnitudes. Our
technique employs the use of galaxy redshifts estimated from their multicolor
photometry (Connolly et al. 1995). Associated with the redshift estimate is a
well defined error distribution. We have derived a variant of Lynden-Bell's
(1971) C--method that considers, for each galaxy, the probability distribution
in absolute magnitude resultant from the redshift error. This technique is
tested through simulations and potential biases are quantified. We then apply
the technique to a sample of galaxies with multicolor photometric data at
moderately faint (B=23) limits, and compare the results to a subset of these
data with spectroscopic redshifts. We find that the luminosity function derived
from the photometric redshifts is consistent with that determined from
spectroscopic redshifts.

0.2 for magnitudes and $\sim$ 0.3 for colors. The redshift completeness level
of the sample is of the order of $\sim$ 35\% at b$_J$=20, and part of this
rather low completeness is the result of the combination of limitations imposed
by the multifiber system with the clustering of galaxies, and an insufficient
number of configurations. At the nominal magnitude limit of the survey, we were
able to measure redshifts for $\sim$ 70 \% of the galaxies we observed. From
the correlation between observed properties of the galaxies in this sample, we
demonstrate that the mean surface brightness is a major limiting factor in our

metal-rich stars and 25% to 50% metal-poor stars. This agrees with the RGB
morphology, the HB luminosity, and the RR Lyrae stars in the M31 halo. The RGB

having [m/H] = -0.6, making the M31 halo significantly more metal- rich than
either the Galactic halo or the M31 GC system. The HB is dominated by a red
clump similar to the 47 Tuc HB but a small number of blue HB stars are visible,
supporting the conclusion that there is a metal-poor component to the M31 halo.
The number of HB stars is smaller than would be expected from the observed
metallicity distribution but it is not clear if this is due to the photometric
limits of our data or a 2nd parameter effect. We find a He abundance of Y >~

optically selected (B and I) samples in the literature, and the corresponding
rest-frame B-band luminosity function evolution is presented. The B-band counts
near B = 24 are shown to be a mixture of normal galaxies at modest redshifts
and galaxies undergoing rapid star formation, which have a wide range of masses
and which are spread over the redshift interval from z = 0.2 to beyond z = 1.7.
The luminosity functions, number counts, and color distributions at optical and
IR wavelengths are discussed in terms of a consistent picture of the
star-forming history of the galaxy sample. [OII] emission-line diagnostics or
rest-frame ultra-violet--infrared color information are used in combination
with rest-frame absolute K magnitudes to construct a ``fundamental plane'' in
which the evolution of the global star-formation rate with redshift can be
shown, and we find that the maximum rest-frame K luminosity of galaxies
undergoing rapid star formation has been declining smoothly with decreasing
redshift from a value near L* at z > 1. This smooth decrease in the
characteristic luminosity of galaxies dominated by star formation can
simultaneously account for the high B-band galaxy counts at faint magnitudes
and the redshift distribution at z < 1 in both the B- and K-selected samples.
Finally, the overall K-band light density evolution is discussed as a tracer of
the baryonic mass in stars and compared with the rate of star formation.

When our results are applied to the evolution of magnetic fields in the early

nucleosynthesis constraints. Further dissipation before recombination
constrains models in which primordial magnetic fields give rise to galactic

differs from that of the associated HII region by 20 arcsec. Toward this
molecular core the 12CO and 13CO peak Tmb line temperatures of 7.3\,K and
1.2\,K are the highest so far found in the Magellanic Clouds. The molecular
concentrations associated with N113, N44BC, N159HW, and N214DE in the LMC and
LIRS\,36 in the SMC were investigated in a variety of molecular species to
study the chemical properties of the interstellar medium. $I$(HCO+)/$I$(HCN)
and $I$(HCN)/$I$(HNC) intensity ratios as well as lower limits to the
$I$(13CO)/$I$(C18O) ratio were derived for the rotational 1--0 transitions.
Generally, HCO+ is stronger than HCN, and HCN is stronger than HNC. The high
relative HCO+ intensities are consistent with a high ionization flux from
supernovae remnants and young stars, possibly coupled with a large extent of
the HCO+ emission region. The bulk of the HCN arises from relatively compact
dense cloud cores. Warm or shocked gas enhances HCN relative to HNC. From
chemical model calculations it is predicted that $I$(HCN)/$I$(HNC) close to one
should be obtained with higher angular resolution ($>$ 30 arcsec) toward the
cloud cores. Comparing virial masses with those obtained from the integrated CO
intensity provides an H2 mass-to-CO luminosity conversion factor of $1.8 \times

adequate production of several light elements while producing primordial

functions near quantum critical points close to, or above, their upper-critical

and critical tuning parameter ($t$) plane. The quantum critical point is at
$T=0$, $t=0$, and in many cases there is a line of finite temperature
transitions at $T = T_c (t)$, $t < 0$ with $T_c (0) = 0$. For the relativistic,
$n$-component $\phi^4$ continuum quantum field theory (which describes lattice
quantum rotor ($n \geq 2$) and transverse field Ising ($n=1$) models) the upper
critical dimension is $d=3$, and for $d<3$, $\epsilon=3-d$ is the control
parameter over the entire phase diagram. In the region $|T - T_c (t)| \ll T_c
(t)$, we obtain an $\epsilon$ expansion for coupling constants which then are
input as arguments of known {\em classical, tricritical,} crossover functions.
In the high $T$ region of the continuum theory, an expansion in integer powers
of $\sqrt{\epsilon}$, modulo powers of $\ln \epsilon$, holds for all
thermodynamic observables, static correlators, and dynamic properties at all
Matsubara frequencies; for the imaginary part of correlators at real
frequencies ($\omega$), the perturbative $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ expansion describes
quantum relaxation at $\hbar \omega \sim k_B T$ or larger, but fails for $\hbar
\omega \sim \sqrt{\epsilon} k_B T$ or smaller. An important principle,
underlying the whole calculation, is the analyticity of all observables as
functions of $t$ at $t=0$, for $T>0$; indeed, analytic continuation in $t$ is
used to obtain results in a portion of the phase diagram. Our method also
applies to a large class of other quantum critical points and their associated

the associated fieldstrength superform, subject to some covariant constraints,
in extended central charge superspace. We find that this solution is given in
terms of an 8+8 tensor multiplet subject to an additional constraint. We give
the transformation laws for the multiplet as well as invariant superfield and
component field lagrangians, and mention possible couplings to other
multiplets. We also allude to the relevance of the 3--form geometry for generic
invariant supergravity actions.

algorithm in which intermediate states are treated based on Whitehead's moment
method is inspected, by taking examples of the double GT$^+$ transitions
$\mbox{$^{36}$Ar}\rightarrow\mbox{$^{36}$S}$,
$\mbox{$^{54}$Fe}\rightarrow\mbox{$^{54}$Cr}$ and $\mbox{$^{58}$Ni}
\rightarrow\mbox{$^{58}$Fe}$. This algorithm yields rapid convergence on the
$2\nu\beta\beta$ matrix-elements, even when neither relevant GT$^+$ nor GT$^-$
strength distribution is convergent. A significant role of the shell structure
is pointed out, which makes the $2\nu\beta \beta$ matrix-elements highly
dominated by the low-lying intermediate states. Experimental information of the
low-lying GT$^\pm$ strengths is strongly desired. Half-lives of
$T^{2\nu}_{1/2}({\rm EC}/{\rm EC};

extracted coupling constants are mostly inconsistent with the prediction of
SU(3) symmetry or the information from hadronic reactions. In order to further
analyze this problem, we introduce a form factor at the hadronic vertices $KNY$
(with $Y=\Lambda~ \textrm{or}~ \Sigma$) and study its behavior qualitatively.
Our result suggests the need of more accurate experiments, especially in the
charged $\Sigma$ and the neutral $K^0$ channels.

  Geometry, Thessaloniki, May 1996, 10 pages, Latex",,,,"q-alg math.QA",,"  In the context of a noncommutative differential calculus on the algebra of
real valued functions of an $n$-dimensional manifold $M$, a commutative and
associative product of 1-forms is naturally defined. Ordinary differential
calculus corresponds to this product being trivially zero. We consider the
minimal generalization in which the algebra of 1-forms with this product is
nilpotent of degree 3. Basic tensor analysis and differential geometry are
developped in this context and applied to the formulation of symplectic
geometry and Hamiltonian dynamics. It is shown that the corresponding Liouville
equation can take the form of a generalized Fokker-Planck equation, well known
in statistical mechanics of open systems, as well as in stochastic calculus.
Specifically it may be the same with that obtained via Ito stochastic calculus,
when solving a linear stochastic differential equation with a Wiener process as
the stochastic term. The close connection between noncommutative differential
structures of this kind, with semimartingale stochastic processes on manifolds
thus suggested, is further explored.

featured by their algebraic structure. Also, two lemmas and one theorem have
been developed in order to algebraically reformulate the theory on more
rigorous grounds. Finally, we have been able to build a coherent and
self-contained formalism independent on any matricial representation , removing
in this way the degeneracy problem .
