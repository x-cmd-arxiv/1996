  Submitted to Astropysical Journal",,"10.1086/304665",,"astro-ph",,"  A common remark at conferences and meetings has been: ""One can fit any light
curve with binary lens models because of the large number of parameters!"" It is
especially tempting to claim that some of the possible binary events in the
Galactic microlensing searches could be caused by cataclysmic variables since
both phenomena exhibits asymmetric light curves. This paper presents a
statistical analysis comparing the light curves of cataclysmic variable stars
to the light curves generated from binary lens models. It is shown that the
light curves of high amplitude cataclysmic variables are one example of light
curves that can not be explained with binary lens models. It is, therefore, not
only unlikely, but also impossible that cataclysmic variables can contaminate
the binary microlens candidates.

narrow core at an energy of about 6.4 keV, and a broad red wing extending to
below 5 keV, which are interpreted as line emission arising from the inner
parts of an accretion disk. The narrow core correlates well with the continuum
flux whereas the broad wing weakly anti-correlates. When the source is
brightest, the line is dominated by the narrow core, whilst during a deep
minimum, the narrow core is very weak and a huge red tail appears. However, at
other times when the continuum shows rather rapid changes, the broad wing is
more variable than the narrow core, and shows evidence for correlated changes
contrary to its long time scale behaviour. The peculiar line profile during the
deep minimum spectrum suggests that the line emitting region is very close to a
central spinning (Kerr) black hole where enormous gravitational effects
operate.

stellar mass function down to masses even below the hydrogen-burning limit. The
fundamental limit to this technique is the presence of unresolved binaries,
which can in principle significantly alter the inferred mass function. Here we
quantify the fraction of binaries that can be detected using microlensing,
considering specifically the mass ratio and separation of the binary. We find
that almost all binary systems with separations greater than $b \sim 0.4$ of
their combined Einstein ring radius are detectable assuming a detection
threshold of $3\%$. For two M dwarfs, this corresponds to a limiting separation
of $\gsim 1 \au$. Since very few observed M dwarfs have companions at
separations $\lsim 1 \au$, we conclude that close binaries will probably not
corrupt the measurements of the mass function. We find that the detectability
depends only weakly on the mass ratio. For those events for which individual
masses can be determined, we find that binaries can be detected down to $b \sim
0.2$.

DOP perform if tested on unedited data, and (2) how can DOP be used for parsing
word strings that contain unknown words? This paper addresses these questions.
We show that parse results on unedited data are worse than on cleaned-up data,
although very competitive if compared to other models. As to the parsing of
word strings, we show that the hardness of the problem does not so much depend
on unknown words, but on previously unseen lexical categories of known words.
We give a novel method for parsing these words by estimating the probabilities
of unknown subtrees. The method is of general interest since it shows that good
performance can be obtained without the use of a part-of-speech tagger. To the
best of our knowledge, our method outperforms other statistical parsers tested

the expression for $\chi(\set{q},E)$ is exact. For the Emery-Blume-Griffiths

confirm the exponent $\frac{3}{2}$ (already checked experimentally), as the

normally to the phase boundary, and we determine a new singularity along the
tangential direction. Both singularities describe the rounding off of the
crystal near a facet. The hole excitations of the spin chain at this point on

$\Delta E \sim N^{-\half}$ for the low--lying excited states, where $N$ is the

covariant at each step, permitting to use abstract representation of tensor

whatsoever thus being a completely natural one. For the sake of the reader's
convenience, a synopsis of tensor calculus in pseudo-Riemannian space-time
precedes discussion of the subject, containing expressions rarely encountered
in literature but essentially facilitating the consideration. We give also a
comparison of the monad formalism with the other approaches to description of
reference frames in general relativity. In three chapters we consider
applications of the monad formalism to general relativistic mechanics,
electromagnetic and gravitational fields theory. Alongside of the general
theory, which includes the monad representation of basic equations of motion of
(charged) particles and of fields, several concrete solutions are provided to
clarify the physical role and practical application of reference frames (e.g.,
cases when a rotating electrically charged fluid does not produce any electric
field in its co-moving reference frame, or kinematic magnetic charges arise in
a rotating frame). The cases are discussed when it is unnecessary to introduce
a reference frame, and when such an introduction is essential. Special
attention is dedicated to analogy between gravitation, electromagnetism and
mechanics (e.g., the dragging phenomenon and existence in the Maxwell equations
in rotating frames of terms of the same nature as that of the Coriolis and

scale during the slow roll-down of the inflaton field; this is shown to
correspond to the flux of field energy across the horizon according to the
First Law of black hole mechanics. When quantum effects are taken into account,
however, it is found that most black holes evaporate before the end of
inflation. Finally, we consider the pair creation of magnetically charged black
holes, which cannot evaporate. In standard Einstein-Maxwell theory we find that
their number in the presently observable universe is exponentially small. We
speculate how this conclusion may change if dilatonic theories are applied.

Epstein and Glaser. In this approach gauge invariance is expressed by a simple
commutator relation for the S-matrix and the corresponding gauge
transformations are simple transformations of the free fields only. In spite of
this simplicity, gauge invariance implies the usual Slavnov-Taylor identities.
The main purpose of this paper is to prove the latter statement. Since the
Slavnov-Taylor identities are formulated in terms of Green's functions, we
investigate the agreement of two perturbative definitions of Green's functions,
namely of Epstein and Glaser's definition with the Gell-Mann Low series.
