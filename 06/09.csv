the first using the full third order calculation of the pion-nucleon scattering
amplitude and the second by including the resonances $\Delta$ and $N^*$ as
explicit degrees of freedom in the Lagrangian. We compare the results of the
two methods with phase shifts extracted from fits to the pion-nucleon
scattering data. We find good to fair agreement between the calculations and
the phase shifts from scattering data.

\sqrt{2}m_t$ for masses of the top quark and the Higgs boson, which is
predicted by the standard model based on generalized covariant derivatives with
gauge and Higgs fields. This relation is a low energy manifestation of a tree
level constraint which holds among the quartic Higgs self-coupling constant and
the Yukawa coupling constants at a certain high energy scale $\mu_0$. With the
renormalization group equation at one-loop level, the evolution of the
constraint is calculated from $\mu_0$ down to the low energy region around the
observed top quark mass. The result of analysis shows that the Higgs boson mass
is in $m_t \lesssim m_{\rm H} \lesssim \sqrt{2}m_t$ for a wide range of the
energy scale $\mu_0 \gtrsim m_t$ and it approaches to 177 GeV ($\approx m_t$)
for large values of $\mu_0$.

inelastic scattering producing a small mass. This process is analyzed by the
calculation of $\bar q\, q$ and $\bar q\, q\, G$ production. We show that the
small distance contributions ($r_{\perp}\,\propto\,1/Q$) to the longitudinal
polarised virtual photon dominate the diffractive channels. Formulae for the
cross section using the gluon density are written within the framework of
perturbative QCD. We show that the production of small masses by a transverse
polarised photon is concentrated at moderate values of $r_{\perp} \,\sim\,1
GeV^{-1}$, where the pQCD approach is valid. It is shown that only $\bar q\, q$
pair production contributes to diffraction dissociation with $\b\,>\,$ 0.4 and
the possibility to extract the values of the gluon density from the
measurements in this kinematic region is discussed. Shadowing corrections are
assessed for both longitudinal and transverse polarised photons and estimates
of the different damping factors are given. The relation between diffractive
production and the corrections to $F_2$ is alluded to. The evolution of the
diffractive structure function is studied and a solution to the difractive
evolution equations is proposed.
