number of elements, and is inspired by the cell differentiation problem. The
growth of elements is made possible first by clustering the phases, and then by
differentiating roles. The former leads to the time sharing of resources, while
the latter leads to the separation of roles for the growth. The mechanism of
the differentiation of elements is studied. An extension to a model with
several internal phase variables is given, which shows differentiation of
internal states. The relevance of interacting dynamics with internal states
(``intra-inter"" dynamics) to biological problems is discussed with an emphasis
on heterogeneity by clustering, macroscopic robustness by partial
synchronization and recursivity with the selection of initial conditions and
digitalization.

points in P^r? This question is central to the programme of connecting the
geometry of point sets in projective space with the structure of the free
resolutions of their ideals. There is a lower bound for the resolution
computable from the (known) Hilbert function, and it seemed natural to
conjecture that this lower bound would be achieved. This is the ``Minimal
Resolution Conjecture'' (Lorenzini [1987], [1993]). Hirschowitz and Simpson
[1994] showed that the conjecture holds when the number of points is large
compared with r, but three examples (with r = 6,7,8) discovered computationally
by Schreyer in 1993 show that the conjecture fails in general. We describe a
novel structure inside the free resolution of a set of points which accounts
for the observed failures and provides a counterexample in P^r for every r\geq
6, r\neq 9. The geometry behind our construction occurs not in P^r but in a
different projective space, in which there is a related set of points, the
``Gale transform'' (or ``associated set'', in the sense of Coble.)

related to anomalous silicon isotope ratios within presolar grains extracted
from meteorites; namely: (1) What is the relative importance for silicon
isotopic compositions in the bulk ISM of Type II supernovae, Type Ia
supernovae, and AGB stars? (2) Are $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si primary or secondary
nucleosynthesis products? (3) In what isotopic direction in a three-isotope
plot do core-collapse supernovae of different mass move the silicon isotopic
composition? (4) Why do present calculations not reproduce the solar ratios for
silicon isotopes, and what does that impose upon studies of anomalous Si
isotopes in meteoritic silicon carbide grains? (5) Are chemical-evolution
features recorded in the anomalous SiC grains? Our answers are formulated on
the basis of the Woosley \& Weaver (1995) supernova yield survey.
Renormalization with the calculated interstellar medium silicon isotopic
composition and solar composition is as an important and recurring concept of
this paper. Possible interpretations of the silicon isotope anomalies measured
in single SiC grains extracted from carbonaceous meteorites are then presented.
The calculations suggest that the temporal evolution of the isotopic silicon

the observed f(152) for age 2.5 Myr, after correction for extinction. We
attribute the increasing fraction of ``missing'' H-alpha flux with decreasing
radius to increasing extinction in the Lyman continuum. Increasing
extinction-corrected far-UV flux of the HII regions with decreasing radius is
probably a result of the corresponding increasing column density of the
interstellar gas resulting in larger mass OB associations. The estimated

Width at Half Maximum, FWHM$\sim 50,000$~km s$^{-1}$). However, many of the
line profiles are asymmetric. A strong red wing is indicative of gravitational
redshifts close to a central black hole and accretion disk models provide an
excellent description of the data. The peak energy of the line is 6.4~keV,
indicating that it arises by fluorescence in near-neutral material. Our fits
imply a low inclination for the disk in these Seyfert 1 galaxies, with a mean
of 30\deg, consistent with orientation-dependent unification schemes.
Differences in the line profiles from source-to-source imply slight variations
in geometry, which cannot be accounted for solely by inclination. In most
cases, we require that the line emission arises from a range of radii. Although
a small contribution to the emission from a region other than the disk is not
ruled out, it is not generally required and has little effect on our
conclusions regarding the disk line. Our data are fit equally well with
rotating (Kerr) and non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole models. We find a
mean spectral index in the 3-10 keV range of $<\Gamma_{3-10}>=1.91\pm 0.07$

innermost regions of AGN, and arguably provide the best evidence yet obtained

that the damping rate of their spin fluctuations is essentially independent of
temperature, while the resistivity exhibits a crossover from Fermi liquid
behavior at low temperature to linear-in-T above a certain temperature $T_0$,
due to the proximity of the quasiparticle Fermi surface to the magnetic
Brillouin zone boundary. For the underdoped cuprates we argue that the sequence
of crossovers identified by Barzykin and Pines in the low frequency magnetic
behavior (from mean field $z=2$ at high temperatures, $T>T_{cr}$, to
non-universal $z=1$ scaling behavior at intermediate $T$, $T_*<T<T_{cr}$, to
pseudogap behavior below $T_*$) reflects the development in the electronic
structure of a precursor to a spin-density-wave state. This development begins
at $T_{cr}$ with a thermal evolution of the quasiparticle spectral weight which
brings about temperature dependent spin-damping and ends at $T_*$ where the
Fermi surface has lost pieces near corners of the magnetic Brillouin zone. For
$T_*<T<T_{cr}$ the resistivity is linear in $T$ because this change in spectral
weight does not affect the resistivity significantly; below $T_*$ vertex
corrections act to bring about the measured downturn in $(\rho(T)-\rho(0))/T$

oscillations in the mode population will arise. We propose to use an array of
gates in order to simulate a moving quantum point contact for detecting the
mode population oscillations, since they discriminate between different modes.
By consecutively activating them we expect to see both photovoltaic effects and
photoconductive effects which can easily be distinguished from noise.

takes the typically dual form, the Pomeron contribution being taken into

realized in string theory has made it possible to systematically obtain new
constraints on string GUT model-building. In this paper, we perform such a
study for the case of SO(10) free-field string GUT models, and find a number of
significant new results. First, we show that within the conventional string
models using the so-called ``diagonal'' embeddings, all representations larger
than the 16 must always transform as singlets under all gauge symmetries beyond
SO(10). This includes the 45 and 54 representations, and holds regardless of
the affine level at which SO(10) is realized. Furthermore, we show that such
constructions can never give rise to the 120, 126, or 144 representations of
SO(10) --- again regardless of the affine level. We also perform a similar
analysis for E_6, and find that the adjoint 78 representation must always
transform as a singlet under all gauge symmetries beyond E_6; moreover, all

these results thus severely limit the types of phenomenologically realistic

free-field embeddings, and show that in the SO(10) case such embeddings may

crack propagation and dislocation emission. We show that the stress intensity
factor required to propagate the crack is increased as the crack is blunted by
up to thirteen atomic layers, but only by a relatively modest amount for a
crack with a sharp 60$^\circ$ corner. The effect of the blunting is far less
than would be expected from a smoothly blunted crack; the sharp corners
preserve the stress concentration, reducing the effect of the blunting.
However, for some material parameters blunting changes the preferred
deformation mode from brittle cleavage to dislocation emission. In such
materials, the absorption of preexisting dislocations by the crack tip can
cause the crack tip to be locally arrested, causing a significant increase in
the microscopic toughness of the crack tip. Continuum plasticity models have
shown that even a moderate increase in the microscopic toughness can lead to an
increase in the macroscopic fracture toughness of the material by several
orders of magnitude. We thus propose an atomic-scale mechanism at the crack
tip, that ultimately may lead to a high fracture toughness in some materials
where a sharp crack would seem to be able to propagate in a brittle manner.
Results for blunt cracks loaded in mode II are also presented.

within the framework of the relativistic plane-wave impulse approximation,
beginning with an analysis of the model-independent kinematical constraints to
be found in the missing energy--missing momentum plane. From the interplay
between these constraints and the spectral function basic features of the
exclusive and inclusive nuclear responses are seen to arise. In particular, the
responses of the relativistic Fermi gas and of a specific hybrid model with
confined nucleons in the initial state are compared in this work. As expected,
the exclusive responses are significantly different in the two models, whereas
the inclusive ones are rather similar. By extending previous work on the
relativistic Fermi gas, a reduced response is introduced for the hybrid model
such that it fulfills the Coulomb and the higher-power energy-weighted sum
rules. While incorporating specific classes of off-shellness for the struck
nucleons, it is found that the reducing factor required is largely
model-independent and, as such, yields a reduced response that is useful for
extracting the Coulomb sum rule from experimental data. Finally, guided by the
difference between the energy-weighted sum rules of the two models, a version
of the relativistic Fermi gas is devised which has the 0$^{\rm th}$, 1$^{\rm
st}$ and 2$^{\rm nd}$ moments of the charge response which agree rather well
with those of the hybrid model: this version thus incorporates {\em a priori}
the binding and confinement effects of the stuck nucleons while retaining the
simplicity of the original Fermi gas.

equation, we study its multiple-time higher-order evolution equations. As a
first result, the equations of the Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy are shown to
play a crucial role in providing a secularity-free perturbation theory in the
specific case of a solitary-wave solution. Then, as a consequence, we show that
the related perturbative series can be summed and gives exactly the
solitary-wave solution of the RLW equation. Finally, some comments and
considerations are made on the N-soliton solution, as well as on the
limitations of applicability of the multiple scale method in obtaining uniform
perturbative series.

theories in terms of the Drinfeld-Sokolov dressing operator. For this, we
introduce a larger space of fields, containing ``half screening charges'' and
``half integrals of motions''. In addition to local terms, the Poisson brackets
contain nonlocal terms related to trigonometric r-matrices.

product expansion yields a generalization of the quantum adiabatic
approximation. Furthermore, it leads to an infinite class of exactly solvable
models.
