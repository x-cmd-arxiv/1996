spectral type of NX Pup B in the range F7-G4, masses of 2 M$_\odot$ and
1.6--1.9 M$_\odot$, respectively, and an age of 3--5~Myr for both stars. We
discuss the implication of the new age determination on the physical relation
between NX Pup and the cometary globule. The dynamical lifetime of $\approx$
10$^6$ yr for cometary globule 1 suggests that cometary globule 1 and the
nearby cometary globule 2 represent transient phenomena and are left overs of a
larger molecular cloud which in turn was the parental cloud of NX~Pup A and B
and finally got dispersed by photoevaporation. The IR excess of NX Pup A can be
modeled by a viscous accretion disk, which is cut off at $\approx$ 20 AU from
the star. NX Pup B has a smaller IR excess which indicates that there is less
circumstellar material present than around the primary.

first one is an extension of the well-known formalism by DeWitt and Brehme
developed for deriving the equation of motion of an electrically charged
particle. In contrast to the electromagnetic case, in which there are two
different charges, i.e., the electric charge and the mass, the gravitational
counterpart has only one charge. This fact prevents us from using the same
renormalization scheme that was used in the electromagnetic case. To make clear
the subtlety in the first approach, we then consider the asymptotic matching of
two different schemes, i.e., the internal scheme in which the small particle is
represented by a spherically symmetric black hole with tidal perturbations and
the external scheme in which the metric is given by small perturbations on the
given background geometry. The equation of motion is obtained from the
consistency condition of the matching. We find that in both ways the same
equation of motion is obtained. The resulting equation of motion is analogous
to that derived in the electromagnetic case. We discuss implications of this

experiences drag and diffusion forces. When outside the plasma, the quark
travels as a $D$ meson and experiences collisions with pions. Additional energy
transfer takes place when the quark enters or leaves a droplet. We find that
the transverse momentum of $D$ mesons provides a rough thermometer of the phase

density is zero. This suggests that there is no spontaneous breaking of the
SU(2) subgroup of the symmetry, at least in this mean-field approximation. For
