a strong nebular HeII emission due to a significant fraction of WC stars in
early WR phases of the burst. For other metallicities broad WR emission will
always dominate the HeII emission. Our predictions of the nebular HeII

the spectra to model atmospheres, we derive an effective temperature
$T_{\rm{}eff}=8550\pm25\,$K and a surface gravity $\log{}g=6.75\pm0.07$ (cgs

$\mwd=0.16\pm0.02\,\msun$. This is the lowest mass among all spectroscopically
identified white dwarfs. We determine radial velocities from our spectra, and
find a radial-velocity amplitude of $280\pm15\,\kms$. With the pulsar's

theory for three--dimensional crystals with one--, two-- or three--dimensional
soft sectors, respectively. Systems with a finite concentration $n_{\rm D}$ of
quenched, randomly placed defects display a phase transition at a temperature
$T_c(n_{\rm D})$, which can be considerably above the transition temperature
$T_c^0$ of the pure system. The phonon correlation function is calculated in
single--site approximation. For $T>T_c(n_{\rm D})$ a dynamical central peak
appears; upon approaching $T_c(n_{\rm D})$, its height diverges and its width
vanishes. Using an appropriate self--consistent method, we calculate the
spatially inhomogeneous order parameter, the free energy and the specific heat,
as well as the dynamical correlation function in the ordered phase. The
dynamical central peak disappears again as the temperatur is lowered below
$T_c(n_{\rm D})$. The inhomogeneous order parameter causes a static central
peak in the scattering cross section, with a finite $k$ width depending on the
orientation of the external wave vector ${\bf k}$ relative to the soft sector.
The jump in the specific heat at the transition temperatur of the pure system
is smeared out by the influence of the defects, leading to a distinct maximum
instead. In addition, there emerges a tiny discontinuity of the specific heat
at $T_c(n_{\rm D})$. We also discuss the range of validity of the mean--field
approach, and provide a more realistic estimate for the transition temperature.

direct product gauge group U(1)^k is spontaneously broken down to a direct
product H of (finite) cyclic groups is presented. The spectrum features global
H charges, vortices carrying flux labeled by the elements of H and dyonic
combinations. Due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect these particles exhibit
toplogical interactions. The remnant of the U(1)^k CS term in the discrete H
gauge theory describing the effective long distance physics of such a model is
shown to be a 3-cocycle for H summarizing the nontrivial topological
interactions cast upon the magnetic vortices by the U(1)^k CS term. It is noted
that there are in general three types of 3-cocycles for a finite abelian gauge
group H: one type describes topological interactions among vortices carrying
flux w.r.t. the same cyclic group in the direct product H, another type gives
rise to topological interactions between vortices carrying flux w.r.t. two
different cyclic factors of H and a third type leading to topological
interactions between vortices carrying flux w.r.t. three different cyclic
factors. Among other things, it is demonstrated that only the first two types
can be obtained from a spontaneously broken U(1)^k CS theory. The 3-cocycles
that can not be reached in this way turn out to be the most interesting. They
render the theory nonabelian and in general lead to dualities with planar
theories with a nonabelian finite gauge group. In particular, the CS theory
with finite gauge group H = Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 defined by such a 3-cocycle is
shown to be dual to the planar discrete D_4 gauge theory with D_4 the dihedral
group of order 8.

relation with a redshift factor. It is also pointed out that this formalism is
extensible to other black holes in an arbitrary spacetime dimension. The

target space isometries contains embedded both $S$ and $T$ classical duality
symmetries of the heterotic string. With one more ignorable coordinate, the

infinite-dimensional symmetries of the Geroch--Kinnersley--Chitre type. Purely

considered where Hamiltonian allows a separation, in particular by the Faddeev
method, of a weakly coupled channel. Width (i.e. the imaginary part) of the
resonance generated by a discrete spectrum eigenvalue of the separated channel
is studied in the case where main part of the Hamiltonian gives itself another
resonance. It is shown that if real parts of these resonances coincide and, at
the same time, a coupling between the separated and main channels is
sufficiently small then the width of the resonance generated by the separated
(molecular) channel is inversely proportional to the width of the main
(nuclear) channel resonance. This phenomenon being a kind of universal law, may
play an important role increasing the ``cold fusion'' probability in electronic
molecules whose nuclear constituents have narrow pre-threshold resonances.

potential on the pion dynamics in intermediate energy heavy ion reactions at 1
GeV/A. For different models, i.e. a phenomenological model and the
$\Delta$--hole model, a pionic potential is extracted from the dispersion
relation and used in Quantum Molecular Dynamics calculations. In addition with
the inelastic scattering processes we thus take care of both, real and
imaginary part of the pion optical potential. A strong influence of the real
pionic potential on the pion in-plane flow is observed. In general such a
potential has the tendency to reduce the anticorrelation of pion and nucleon
flow in non-central collisions.

the lowest critical density $\rho_c=0.037$ f$m^{-3}$ and pressure $p_c=0.157$

  These results are in accord with recent observations from energetic heavy-ion
collisions, which suggest a small liquid-gas phase region.
