coincidence being due to a repeating burst source as well as due to two

a sufficient terminal velocity to protrude through the forward shock front by
taking extra kinetic energy from vorticies generated by shock-cloud

expansion of the supernova ejecta. Ambient magnetic fields are stretched and
amplified as the Rayleigh-Taylor fingers protrude, possibly leading to strongly
enhanced radio emission. The material in the protrusions originates from the
ejected stellar material with greatly enhanced heavy elements. Therefore, it
can be a strong X-ray emitter. The timescale for the Rayleigh-Taylor fingers to

form of white dwarf stars with masses between 0.1 and 1.0 \Msun . Such a halo
white dwarf population, in order to have escaped detection by those who observe
the white dwarf luminosity function of the disk, must have formed from an old
population. The observations indicate that the number of halo white dwarfs per
cubic parsec per unit bolometric magnitude is less than $10^{-5}$ at
$10^{-4.5}$\Lsun; the number must rise significantly at lower luminosities to
provide the needed baryonic halo mass. Such white dwarfs may easily escape
detection in most current and earlier surveys. Though it is limited in angular
extent, the {\em Hubble Deep Field} (HDF) probes a sufficient volume of the
galactic halo to provide interesting limits on the number of halo white dwarf
stars, and on the fraction of the halo mass that they can make up. If the HDF
field can be probed for stars down to $V=29.8$ then the MACHO result suggests
that there could be up to 12 faint halo white dwarfs visible in the HDF.
Finding (or not finding) these stars in turn places interesting constraints on
star formation immediately following the formation of the galaxy.

resembles the observed radio structure in the main shell of young SNRs, which
is evidence that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability is an ongoing process in young
SNRs. When only the peculiar components of the magnetic fields generated by the
instability are considered, the polarization B-vector in the inner radio shell
is preferentially radial with about $20 \sim 50\%$ of fractional polarization

in the turbulent inner shell and increases outward, which is attributed to the
geometric effect. The polarized intensity is found to be correlated with the

density and zero temperature in d = 2, 3, ... dimensions. Our main concern is
to characterize those systems that, under the renormalization flow, are driven
away from the Landau Fermi liquid (LFL) renormalization group fixed point. We
are especially interested in understanding under what circumstances such a
system is a Marginal Fermi liquid (MFL) when the dimension of space is greater
or equal than 2 . The interacting electron system is analyzed by combining
renormalization group (RG) methods with bosonization techniques. The RG
calculations are organized as a double expansion in the inverse scale
parameter, $\lambda^{-1} ,$ which is proportional to the width of the effective
momentum space around the Fermi surface and in the running coupling constant, $
g_\lambda , $ which measures the strength of electron interactions at
corresponding energy scales. Excluding a superconducting instability, the
system can be analyzed by means of bosonization. The RG and the underlying
perturbation expansion in powers of $ \lambda^{-1} $ serve to characterize the
approximations involved by bosonizing the system. We argue that systems with
short-range interactions flow to the LFL fixed point. Within the approximations
involved by bosonization, the same holds for systems with long-range,
longitudinal, density-density interactions. For electron systems interacting
via long-range, transverse, current-current interactions a deviation from LFL
behaviour is possible : the results of the bosonization calculation are
consistent with a MFL, if the exponent parametrizing the singularity of the
interaction potential in momentum space is greater than or equal to d-1.

large coupling or sink strength. Numerical results obtained recently for the

fraction of the matter content of the Universe, with the remainder assumed to
consist of some different type of matter, which, for various reasons must be
nonluminous (dark matter). Among these indications are the inflationary
scenarios which predicts that the average energy density of the Universe
coincides with the so called critical value (for which the expansion never
stops but the rate of expansion approaches zero at very late times). At the
same time it is known (from the predictions of Big Bang nucleosynthesis on the
abundances of the light elements, other than Helium) that the baryonic energy
density (ordinary matter) must represent ($1.5\pm 0.5)h^{-2}$ \% (where $h$ is
the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$) of this critical
value \cite{Copi,OstStein}. We present here evidence supporting the model in
which the rest of the energy density corresponds to a scalar field, which can
be observed, however indirectly, in the oscillation of the effective
gravitational constant, and manifests itself in the known periodicity of the
number distribution of galaxies \cite{Broad,Szalay}. We analyze this model
numerically and show that, the requirement that the model satisfy the bounds of
light element abundances in the Universe, as predicted by Big Bang
nucleosynthesis, yields a specific value for the red-shift-galactic-count
oscillation amplitude compatible with that required to explain the oscillations
described above \cite{hill,CritStein}, and, furthermore, yields a value for the
age of the Universe compatible with standard bounds \cite{OstStein}.

suitable for numerical analysis of coalescing compact binary neutron stars and
gravitational waves from them. We adopt a kind of transverse gauge condition to
determine the shift vector. On the other hand, for determination of the time
slice, we adopt three slice conditions(conformal slice, maximal slice and
harmonic slice) and discuss their properties. Using these conditions, the PN
hydrodynamic equations are obtained up through the 2.5PN order including the
quadrupole gravitational radiation reaction. In particular, we describe methods
to solve the 2PN tensor potential which arises from the spatial 3-metric. It is
found that the conformal slice seems appropriate for analysis of gravitational
waves in the wave zone and the maximal slice will be useful for describing the
equilibrium configurations. The PN approximation in the (3+1) formalism will be
also useful to perform numerical simulations using various slice conditions
and, as a result, to provide an initial data for the final merging phase of
coalescing binary neutron stars which can be treated only by fully general
relativistic simulations.

a result, the two gluon decay rate of $H_2^0$\ is much larger than the two
