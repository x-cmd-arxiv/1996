estimating the dynamical masses of large-scale filaments, whereby the filament
is modeled by an axisymmetric, isothermal cylinder, for which ELT derive a
global relation between the (constant) velocity dispersion and the total line
density. We first show that the model assumptions of ELT can be relaxed
materially: an exact relation between the velocity and line density is derived
for any cylinder (not necessarily axisymmetric), with an arbitrary constituent
distribution function (so isothermality need not be assumed). We then consider
the same problem in the context of the modified dynamics (MOND). After a brief
comparison between scaling properties in the two theories, we study idealized
MOND model filaments. A preliminary application to the segment of the
Perseus-Pisces filament treated by ELT, gives MOND M/L estimates of order 10
s.u., compared with the Newtonian value of about 450, which ELT find. In spite
of the large uncertainties still besetting the analysis, this instance of MOND
application is of particular interest because: 1. Objects of this geometry have
not been dealt with before. 2. It pertains to large-scale structure. 3. The
typical accelerations involved are the lowest so far encountered in a
semi-virialized system.

training, requiring expensive manual annotation of training corpora. This paper
investigates methods for reducing annotation cost by {\it sample selection}. In
this approach, during training the learning program examines many unlabeled
examples and selects for labeling (annotation) only those that are most
informative at each stage. This avoids redundantly annotating examples that
contribute little new information. This paper extends our previous work on {\it
committee-based sample selection} for probabilistic classifiers. We describe a
family of methods for committee-based sample selection, and report experimental
results for the task of stochastic part-of-speech tagging. We find that all
variants achieve a significant reduction in annotation cost, though their
computational efficiency differs. In particular, the simplest method, which has
no parameters to tune, gives excellent results. We also show that sample
selection yields a significant reduction in the size of the model used by the
tagger.

signal for supersymmetry with such a light spectrum and with explicitly broken
$R-$parity. A parton level simulation shows that production of a pair of light
charginos with their subsequent baryon-number violating decays (either through
a stop or through a neutralino) could possibly give rise to this excess. The
decay $\chi^- \ra \tilde{t}_R^\ast b \ra d s b$ with $m_{\chi^-_1} \sim 60
\gev$ and $m_{\tilde t} \sim 52 \gev$ leads to signatures very close to the
experimental observations.

circle of parabolic fixed points is perturbed, a parabolic resonance occurs. It
is proved that its occurrence is generic for one parameter families

experiments indicate that the motion near a parabolic resonance exhibits new
type of chaotic behavior which includes instabilities in some directions and
long trapping times in others. Moreover, in a degenerate case, near a {\it flat
parabolic resonance}, large scale instabilities appear. A model arising from an
atmospherical study is shown to exhibit flat parabolic resonance. This supplies
a simple mechanism for the transport of particles with {\it small} (i.e.
atmospherically relevant) initial velocities from the vicinity of the equator
to high latitudes. A modification of the model which allows the development of
atmospherical jets unfolds the degeneracy, yet traces of the flat instabilities
are clearly observed.
