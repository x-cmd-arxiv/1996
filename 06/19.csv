role and evolution of magnetic fields in the dynamics of supersonic plasma
clumps. We examine the influence of both ambient field strength and orientation
on the problem. Of those two characteristics, field orientation is far more
important in the cases we have considered with $\beta_0 = p_g/p_b \ge 1$. That
is due to the geometry-sensitivity of field stretching/amplification from
large-scale shearing motions around the bullet. When the ambient magnetic field
is transverse to the bullet motion, even a very modest field, well below
equipartition strength, can be amplified by field line stretching around the
bullet within a couple of bullet crushing times so that Maxwell stresses become
comparable to the ram pressure associated with the bullet motion. The
possibility is discussed that those situations might lead to large, induced
electric potentials capable of accelerating charged particles. When the ambient
field is aligned to the bullet motion, on the other hand, reconnection- prone
topologies develop that shorten the stretched field and release much of the
excess energy it contains. In this geometry, the Maxwell stresses on the bullet
never approach the ram pressure level. In both cases, however, the presence of
a field with even moderate initial strength acts to help the flow realign
itself around the bullet into a smoother, more laminar form. That reduces
bullet fragmentation tendencies caused by destructive instabilities. Eddies
seem less effective at field amplification than flows around the bullet,
because fields within eddies tend to be expelled to the eddy perimeters.
Similar effects cause the magnetic field within the bullet itself to be reduced
below its initial value over time.

at that radius. At this higher temperature, the gas pressure in this region is
equal to that of the rest of the cluster at the same radius, but the specific

is a subcluster merger, for which the hydrodynamic simulations predict a

correlation function using two methods: 1.Distribution functions 2.Hydrodynamic
equations without pressure and vorticity. The latter method breaks down once
multistreaming occurs whereas the former does not. We find that the two methods
give the same results to all orders in a perturbative expansion of the two
point correlation function. We thus conclude that we cannot study the
transition from a single stream flow to a multi-stream flow in a perturbative
expansion. We expect this conclusion to hold even if we use the full
gravitational dynamics (GD) instead of ZA. We use ZA to look at the evolution
of the two point correlation function at large spatial separations and we find
that until the onset of multi-streaming the evolution can be described by a
diffusion process where the linear evolution at large scales gets modified by
the rearrangement of matter on small scales. We compare these results with the
lowest order nonlinear results from GD. We find that the difference is only in
the numerical value of the diffusion coefficient and we interpret this
physically. We also use ZA to study the induced three point correlation
function. At the lowest order we find that, as in the case of GD, the three
point correlation does not necessarily have the hierarchical form. We also find
that at large separations the effect of the higher order terms for the three
point correlatin function is very similar to that for the the two point

the probability that the particle is in the initial state after a time t; and
(ii) the nonescape probability P(t), i.e., the probability that the particle

detail the resonant and nonresonant decay. In the former case, after a very

decay as a power law, albeit with different exponents. For the nonresonant case

the interface is constituted by four atomic layers. We consider here
anion--anion interfaces only. We have included the non common either anion or
cation (CdTe/ZnSe), common cation (CdTe/CdSe), and common anion (CdTe/ZnTe)
cases. We have aligned the top of the the valence band at the whole interface
dominion as the boundary condition. The overall conclusion is that the
interface is a very rich space where changes in the band structure with respect
to the bulk do occur. This is true not only at interfaces with no common atoms
but also at the ones with either common cation or anion atoms irrespective to
the fact that the common atomic layers are facing or not each other at the

decays from a sample of 30663 tau-pair events collected in the polar angle
range of Abs(cos(theta)) <0.68 during the 1990-1992 data taking period. Taking
then the Standard Model with the V-A structure of the tau lepton decay, we
measure the average tau polarization to be <p_tau>=(-13.5+/-2.9+/-2.2)% and the
tau polarization forward-backward asymmetry to be AFBpol=(-11.0+/-3.5+/-0.5)%

get an average tau polarization, <p_tau>=(-14.9+/-1.9+/-1.3)% and for the
asymmetry in the polarization, AFBpol=(-8.9+/-2.2+/-0.9)% . These results are
consistent with lepton universality. Combining the two results we obtain for

for which the phases increase slower with the effective $\pi-\pi$ mass than the

one is similar to the well-known ""down"" solution. We find also the third

narrow $f_{0}(750)$ claimed by Svec. All the solutions undergo a rapid change
at the $K\overline{K}$ threshold. Above 1420 MeV the phase shifts increase with

fields and at the strictly one-loop level, the required gluon self-energy-like
function is precisely that obtained from S-matrix elements via the pinch
technique. The generalization of the pinch technique to explicitly off-shell
processes is then introduced. It is shown how, as a result of a fundamental
cancellation among conventional perturbation theory diagrams, encoded in the
QCD Ward identities, the pinch technique one-loop gluon self-energy
i\hat{\Pi}_{\mu\nu}^{ab}(q) remains gauge-independent and universal regardless
of the fact that the ``external'' fields in the given process are off-shell.
This demonstration involves a simple technique enabling the isolation, in an
arbitrary gauge, of i\hat{\Pi}_{\mu\nu}^{ab}(q) from subclasses of up to
several hundred diagrams at once. Furthermore, it is shown how this one-loop
cancellation mechanism iterates for the subclasses of n-loop diagrams
containing implicitly the Dyson chains of n one-loop self-energies

summation of i\hat{\Pi}_{\mu\nu}^{ab}(q) is thus demonstrated explicitly in a

physics of the ``top-down'' RG flow is independent of the ultraviolet (UV)
physics. The central issues are i) IR attractive fixed point values for the top
and the Higgs mass, the most outstanding one being m_t=O(190 GeV)sin(beta) in
the MSSM, ii) IR attractive relations between parameters, the most prominent
ones being an IR fixed top-Higgs mass relation in the SM, leading to m_H=O(156)
GeV for the experimental top mass, and an IR fixed relation between the top
mass and tan(beta) in the MSSM, and iii) an analytical assessment of their
respective strengths of attraction. The triviality and vacuum stability bounds
on the Higgs and top masses in the SM and the upper bound on the lightest Higgs
boson mass in the MSSM are reviewed. The mathematical backbone, the rich
structure of IR attractive fixed points, lines, surfaces,... in the
multiparameter space, is made transparent. Interesting hierarchies emerge, most
remarkably: IR attraction in the MSSM is systematically stronger than in the

shown to have the same content with the ordinary formulation using {\mbf d},
which helps us understand the implications of the algebraic rules of NCG on

obtained by taking the inner product of the generalized field strength. The
covariant derivative operating on the fermion field determines the parallel
transformation on $M_4\times Z\ma{N}$, which confirms that the Higgs field is
the connection on the discrete space. This implies that the Higgs particle is a
gauge particle on the same footing as the weak bosons. Thus, it is expected
that the mass relation $m\ma{H}=\frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}m\ma{W}\sin\theta\ma{W}$

detection of fragments from the projectile-spectator source.
  The dominant feature of the systematic set of data is the Z_bound
universality that is obeyed by the fragment multiplicities and correlations.
These observables are invariant with respect to the entrance channel if plotted
as a function of Z_bound, where Z_bound is the sum of the atomic numbers Z_i of
all projectile fragments with Z_i \geq 2. No significant dependence on the
bombarding energy nor on the target mass is observed. The dependence of the
fragment multiplicity on the projectile mass follows a linear scaling law.

fragmentation are explored within the realm of the available data and with

much higher bombarding energies than explored in this work and that they are

  Inequalities","LaTeX, 10 pages, one figure (in LaTeX)",,,,"quant-ph atom-ph",,"  We show one can use classical fields to modify a quantum optics experiment so
that Bell's inequalities will be violated. This happens with continuous random
variables that are local, but we need to use the correlation matrix to prove
there can be no joint probability distribution of the observables.

we are able to derive a violation of Bell's inequalities for photon counts
coincidence measurements. Our local probabilistic theory does not use any
specific quantum mechanical calculations.
