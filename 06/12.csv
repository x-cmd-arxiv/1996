from detailed evolutionary sequences of solar metallicity (Z = 0.02)
supplemented by grids of static envelope models of various metallicities (Z =
0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.10). We consider all pulsation modes with l = 0,
1, 2, and 3 in the 80--1500 s period window, the interval currently most
suitable for fast photometric detection techniques. We establish that
significant driving is often present in hot B subdwarfs and is due to an
opacity bump associated with heavy element ionization. We find that models with
Z >= 0.04 show low radial order unstable modes; both radial and nonradial (p,
f, and g) pulsations are excited. The unstable models have Teff > 30,000 K, and
log g > 5.7, depending somewhat on the metallicity. We emphasize that metal
enrichment needs only occur locally in the driving region. On this basis,
combined with the accepted view that local enrichments and depletions of metals
are common place in the envelopes of hot B subdwarfs, we predict that some of
these stars should show luminosity variations resulting from pulsational
instabilities.

particle in a flat space can be transformed correctly into those in curved
space. This rule arose from well-established methods in the theory of plastic
deformations, where crystals with defects are described mathematically by
applying nonholonomic coordinate transformations to ideal crystals. In the
context of time-sliced path integrals, this has given rise to a {\em quantum
equivalence principle\/} which determines the measure of fluctating orbits in
spaces with curvature and torsion. The nonholonomic transformations are
accompanied by a nontrivial Jacobian which in curved spaces produces an
additional energy proportional to the curvature scalar, thereby canceling an
equal term found earlier by DeWitt from a naive formulation of Feynman's
time-sliced path integral in curved space. The importance of this cancelation
has been documented in various systems (H-atom, particle on the surface of a
sphere, spinning top). Here we point out its relevance in the process of
bosonizing a nonabelian one-dimensional quantum field theory, whose fields live
in a flat field space. Its bosonized version is a quantum-mechanical path
integral of a point particle moving in a space with constant curvature. The
additional term introduced by the Jacobian is crucial for the identity between
original and bosonized theory.
  A useful bozonization tool is the so-called Hubbard-Stratonovich formula for
which we find a nonabelian version.

(2+1)-dimensional integrable systems include quadratures unlike the well known
case of (1+1)-dimensional inegrable systems where the fourth solution is found
with algebraic operations. In the present paper we show how in the case of
(2+1)-dimensional integrable systems one can find an extended formula of
nonlinear superposition such that the resulting solution will be found uniquely
from the given previous solution with algebraic operations.
