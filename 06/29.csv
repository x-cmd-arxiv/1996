above the survey threshold of 1 mJy, about one third of which are in
double-lobed and multi-component sources. We have used these data to obtain the
first high-significance measurement of the two-point angular correlation for a
deep radio sample. We find that the correlation function between $0.02^{\circ}$
and $2^{\circ}$ is well fitted by a power law of the form $A\theta^{\gamma}$
where $A\approx 3\times 10^{-3}$ and $\gamma\approx -1.1$. On small scales
($\theta<0.2^{\circ}$), double and multi-component sources are shown to have a
larger clustering amplitude than that of the whole sample. Sources with flux
densities below 2 mJy are found to have a shallower slope than that obtained
for the whole sample, consistent with there being a significant contribution
from starbursting galaxies at these faint fluxes. The cross-correlation of
radio sources and Abell clusters is determined. A preliminary approach to
inferring spatial information is outlined.

performance of an automatic grouping algorithm designed to identify
extragalactic OB associations. The algorithm identifies the known Galactic OB
associations correctly when the search radius (78 pc) is defined by the
observed stellar surface density. Galactic OB associations identified with a 78
pc search radius have diameters that are $\sim$3 times larger than OB
associations identified with a 22 pc search radius in M33. Applying the smaller
search radius to the Galactic data matches both the sizes and the number of
member stars between the two galaxies quite well. Thus, we argue that this and
similar algorithms should be used with a constant physical search radius,
rather than one which varies with the stellar surface density. Such an approach
would allow the identification of differences in the giant molecular cloud
populations and star formation efficiency under most circumstances.

the optically-selected CfA Seyfert galaxies and the bolometric-flux-limited
12-Micron active galaxy sample. Every object observed was detected at 6 cm.
Only 6-8% of the 12um sample Seyferts (3-4 objects) are radio-loud (and none of
the CfA sample), as compared to 15-20% for the BQS quasars. These radio-loud
objects are compact and have flat spectra, distinguishing them from the more
common radio-quiet objects.
  The 6-20 cm slopes of the Seyfert 1s and 2s are similar, with average values
of about -0.7. Although several Seyfert 1s are significantly flatter than this
in their 6-20 and/or 1.5-6 cm slopes, there is no systematic trend for either
Seyfert type to display upward or downward spectral curvature.
  Excluding the radio-loud quasars, the integrated 6 cm radio luminosity is
linearly proportional to the 60um luminosity over several orders of magnitude,
with on average twice the radio power of normal spirals of the same
far-infrared power. About half of the objects show extended 6 cm emission,
contributing on average 33% of the total flux. Thus the luminosities of these
extended components alone are comparable to normal spirals of similar infrared
luminosities.
  The 12um sample radio luminosity function is slightly higher than that of the
CfA sample. The integrated space density of Seyfert 2s is about 2 times that of
Seyfert 1s over their common range in luminosity. In terms of the standard
unified model, this ratio in space density corresponds to a typical half-angle
of the torus of about 48 degress.

perturbations. For sufficiently small perturbations this quantity coincides
with the usual Lyapunov exponent. When the perturbation is still small compared
to large-scale fluctuations, but large compared to fluctuations at the smallest
dynamically active scales, the finite-size Lyapunov exponent is inversely
proportional to the square of the perturbation size. Our results are supported
by numerical experiments on shell models. We find that intermittency

unsuppressed in high energy collisions. Starting with a topology changing

produced other topology changing solutions with 40% lower incident particle

dimensions. If the world-sheet matter system consists of 2 chiral superfields,
the space-time is Kahler and the dynamics are those of anti-self-dual gravity.
If instead one chiral superfield and one twisted chiral superfield are used,
the space-time is a hermitian manifold with torsion and a dilaton. The string
spectrum consists of a scalar, which is a potential $K$ determining the metric,
torsion and dilaton. The dynamics imply that the curvature with torsion is
anti-self-dual, and an action is found for the potential $K$. It is argued that
any $N=2$ sigma-model with twisted chiral multiplets in any dimension can be
deformed to a conformally invariant theory if the lowest order contribution to
the conformal anomaly vanishes. If there are isometries, more general
geometries are possible in which the dilaton is the Killing potential for a
holomorphic Killing vector.

$SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theories that are asymptotically free, i.e. without and with
$N_f=1,2,3$ quark hypermultiplets. In all cases: $\bullet$ There is a curve of
marginal stability diffeomorphic to a circle and going through all (finite)
singular points of moduli space. $\bullet$ The BPS spectra are discontinuous
across these curves. $\bullet$ The strong-coupling spectra (inside the curves)
contain only those BPS states that can become massless and are responsible for
the singularities. Except for $N_f=3$, they form a multiplet (with different
masses) of the broken global discrete symmetry. $\bullet$ All other
semi-classical BPS states must and do decay consistently when crossing the
curves. $\bullet$ The weak-coupling, i.e. semi-classical BPS spectra, contain
no magnetic charges larger than one for $N_f=0,1,2$ and no magnetic charges
larger than two for $N_f=3$.

representation. Classification of the resulting multiplicity of vacua is
carried outin terms of asymptotic fundamental Wilson loops, or equivalently,
charges at the boundary of the world. We explicitly demonstrate that the
multiplicity of vacuum states is equal to N for SU(N) gauge group. Different
worlds of the theory are classified by the integer number k=0,1,...N-1
(superselection rules) which plays an analogous role to the $\theta$ parameter
in QCD. Via two completely independent approaches we study the physical
properties of these unconnected worlds as a function of k. First, we apply the
well known machinery of the loop calculus in order to calculate the effective
string tensions in the theory as function of $k$. The second way of doing the
same physics is the standard particle/field theoretic calculation for the
binding potential of a pair of infinitely massive fermions. We also calculate
the vacuum energy as function of k.
