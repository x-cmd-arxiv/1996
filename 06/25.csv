redshifts of z=3.209 and z=3.220 which are separated by 0.5"" spatially. Each of
these components has narrow Ly-alpha emission, and possibly NV emission and
SiIV and CIV in absorption or with a P-Cygni profile. The second case is
J123652+621227, which has an arc-like feature offset by 1.8"" to the southwest
of a red elliptical-like galaxy, and a ``counterimage'' offset 1.4"" on the
opposite side. We tentatively find a single line at 5301 AA at the spatial
position of the counterimage, and no corresponding emission line at the
position of the arc. The colors of the counterimage are consistent with the
identification of this line as Ly-alpha at z=3.36. The colors of the arc are
different than those of the counterimage, and thus both the colors and spectra
indicate that this object is unlikely to be a gravitational lens. For a third
lensing candidate (J123656+621221), which is a blue arc offset by 0.9"" from a
red, elliptical-like galaxy, our spectroscopy does not clearly resolve the
system spatially, complicating the interpretation of the spectrum. We discuss
possible identifications of features in the spectrum, and find that
gravitational lensing remains a possibility in this case. We conclude that the
frequency of strong gravitational lensing by galaxies in the HDF appears to be
very low. This result is difficult to reconcile with the introduction of a
cosmological constant to account for the large number of faint blue galaxies
via a large volume element at high redshift.

These results are obtained at leading order in perturbation theory but

functions in Hamiltonian formalism by combining the light-front BJL limit of
high energy amplitudes and the Fock space (multi-parton) description of
hadrons. This study is motivated by some of the theoretical questions emerging
from the ongoing nonperturbative/perturbative studies in light-front QCD and
also by current problems in the interface of perturbative/nonperturbative QCD.
In this preliminary study, we address the unpolarized structure function $F_2$.
Our starting point is the expression for the quark structure function as the
Fourier transform of the expectation value of the {\it good component} of a
bilocal current in the target state. By expanding the target state in a set of
multi-particle Fock states, the structure function is expressed as the sum of
squares of multi-parton wavefunctions integrated over independent longitudinal
and transverse parton momenta. Utilizing the fact that the multi-particle Fock
states are connected with each other by the light-front QCD Hamiltonian, we
study questions of cancellation of collinear singularities, factorization of
mass singularities, and the logarithmic scaling violations in the Hamiltonian
picture. In this paper the essential features of the formalism are illustrated
utilizing the calculation of the structure function of a dressed quark and the
evolution of the valence part of the $q {\bar q}$ bound state structure
function up to order $g^2$.

negative-energy flux which ensures energy conservation and guarantees unitary

preserve its bispectrality. A sufficient condition for this to occur is given,
and applied to the case of generalized Airy operators of arbitrary order $r>1$.
As a result, the bispectrality of a large family of algebras of rank $r$ is
demonstrated. An involution on these algebras is exhibited which exchanges the
role of spatial and spectral parameters, generalizing Wilson's rank one
bispectral involution. Spectral geometry and the relationship to the Sato
grassmannian are discussed.

investigate the truncated tensor product of braided modules.

existence of a universal R-matrix is demonstrated for the case when the
parameters are in general position. Algebraic surfaces in parameter space are
characterized by the appearance of certain ideals; in this case the universal
R-matrix exists on the associated algebraic quotient. In special cases the
quotient is a ""standard"" quantum group; all familiar quantum groups including
twisted ones are obtained in this way. In other special cases one finds new
types of coboundary bi-algebras. The ""standard"" universal R-matrix is shown to
be the unique solution of a very simple, linear recursion relation. The
classical limit is obtained in the case of quantized Kac-Moody algebras of
finite and affine type. Returning to the general case, we study deformations of
the standard R-matrix and the associated Hopf algebras. A preliminary
investigation of the first order deformations uncovers a class of deformations
that incompasses the quantization of all Kac-Moody algebras of finite and
affine type. The corresponding exact deformations are described as generalized
twists, $ R_\epsilon = (F^t)^{-1}RF$, where $R$ is the standard R-matrix and
the cocycle $F$ (a power series in the deformation parameter $\epsilon$) is the
solution of a linear recursion relation of the same type as that which
determines $R$. Included here is the universal R-matrix for the elliptic
quantum groups associated with $sl(n)$, a big surprise! Specializing again, to
the case of quantized Kac-Moody algebras, and taking the classical limit of
these esoteric quantum groups, one re-discovers all the trigonometric and
elliptic r-matrices of Belavin and Drinfeld. The formulas obtained here are
easier to use than the original ones, and the structure of the space of
classical r-matrices is more transparent. The r-matrices obtained here are more
general in that they are defined on the full Kac-Moody algebras, the central
extensions of the loop groups.
