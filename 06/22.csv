from Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). Using parameters appropriate to YSOs we have
carried out high resolution hydrodynamic simulations modeling the interaction
of a central wind with an environment characterized by a moderate opening angle
toroidal density distribution. The results show that the the wind/environment
interaction produces strongly collimated supersonic jets. The jet is composed
of shocked wind gas. Using analytical models of wind blown bubble evolution we
show that the scenario studied here should be applicable to YSOs and can, in
principle, initiate collimation on the correct scales (R ~ 100 AU). The
simulations reveal a number of time-dependent non-linear features not
anticipated in previous analytical studies including: a prolate wind shock; a
chimney of cold swept-up ambient material dragged into the bubble cavity; a
plug of dense material between the jet and bow shocks. We find that the
collimation of the jet occurs through both de Laval nozzles and focusing of the
wind via the prolate wind shock. Using an analytical model for shock focusing
we demonstrate that a prolate wind shock can, by itself, produce highly
collimated supersonic jets.

low as 43, as previously suggested based on optical absorption measurements of

fields in the nearby universe using recent measurements of Tully-Fisher
distances for a sample of late spirals. We find significant differences between
our reconstructed fields and those obtained in earlier work: overdensities tend
to be more compact while underdense regions, consisting of individual voids,
are more abundant. Our results suggest that voids observed in redshift surveys
of galaxies represent real voids in the underlying matter distribution. While
we detect a bulk velocity of $\sim$ 300 \kms, within a top-hat window 6000 \kms
in radius, the flow is less coherent than previously claimed, exhibiting a
bifurcation towards the Perseus-Pisces and the Great Attractor complexes. This
is the first time that this feature is seen from peculiar velocity
measurements. The observed velocity field resembles, more closely than any
previous reconstruction, the velocity field predicted from self-consistent
reconstructions based on all-sky redshift surveys. This better match is likely
to affect estimates of the parameter $\beta = \Omega^{0.6}/b$ and its
uncertainty based on velocity-velocity comparisons.

called gonihedric principle we find a large class of discrete integral

These integral invariants include the discrete version of the Hilbert-Einstein
action found by Regge and alternative actions which are linear with respect to
the size of the manifold. In addition the concept of generalized deficit angles
appear in a natural way and is related to higher order curvature terms. These
angles may be used to introduce various aspects of rigidity in simplicial
quantum gravity.

necessarily leads to an extension of the N=2 string theory to a theory of 2+2
dimensional supermembranes propagating in 2+10 dimensional target space. The
supermembrane requires maximal conformal supersymmetry in 2+2 dimensions, in
the way advocated by Siegel. The corresponding self-dual N=4 Yang-Mills theory
and the self-dual N=8 (gauged) supergravity in 2+2 dimensions thus appear to be
naturally associated to the membrane theory, not a string. Since the same
theory of membranes seems to represent the M-theory which is apparently
underlying the all known N=1 string theories, the N=2 strings now appear on
equal footing with the other string models as particular limits of the unique
fundamental theory. Unlike the standard 10-dimensional superstrings, the N=2
strings seem to be much closer to a membrane description of F&M theory.

conditions characterized by large fluctuations of the local energy density (hot
spots) and of the collective flow field (turbulence). Assuming that local
equilibrium is reached on a small time scale, $\sim 0.5$ fm/c, the transverse
evolution of those initial conditions is computed using hydrodynamics. We find
that a new class of collective flow phenomena (hadronic volcanoes) could arise
under such conditions. This could be observable via enhanced azimuthal
fluctuations of the transverse energy flow, $d^2E_\perp/d\phi dy$.

increases the triton binding energy by about 0.30 MeV. This may explain a large

In the Barut-Girardello analytic representation the factorisation is
implemented as a convolution. Several examples are given which demonstrate the
physical significance of the factorisation and its role for quantum statistics.
In particular, we study the effect of phase-space interference on the
factorisation properties of a superposition state.
