protostellar disk, we carried out 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations of the disk-star interaction. The closed magnetic loops connecting
the central star and the disk are twisted by the rotation of the disk. As the
twist accumulates, magnetic loops expand and finally approach to the open field
configuration. A current sheet is formed inside the expanding loops. In the
presence of resistivity, magnetic reconnection takes place in the current
sheet. Outgoing magnetic island and post flare loops are formed as a result of
the reconnection. The time scale of this `flare' is the order of the rotation
period of the disk. The released magnetic energy partly goes into the thermal
energy and heats up the flaring plasma up to $10^8$ K. The length of the
flaring loop is several times of the radius of the central star, consistent
with observations. The speed of the hot plasmoid ejected by the reconnection is
$200-400 $ km s$^{-1}$ when the footpoint of the loop is at 0.03 AU from 1
M$_\odot$ protostar. The hot plasma outflow can explain the speed and mass flow
rate of optical jets. Dense, cold, magnetically accelerated wind ($v \sim
150-250$ km s$^{-1}$) emanates from the surface of the disk along the partially
open magnetic field lines threading the disk. This dense, cold wind may
correspond to high velocity neutral winds.

observations are now available for 359 of the 1055 LBQS quasars. The radio-loud
fraction is constant at ~10% over the absolute magnitude range -28 <= MB <=
-23, and it rises to ~20% (log R > 1) or ~35% (log L > 25) at the brightest
absolute magnitudes in the sample. This nearly flat distribution differs
markedly from those of the optically selected Palomar-Green (PG) Bright Quasar
Survey and the X-ray selected Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS), both
of which have lower radio-loud fractions for absolute magnitudes fainter than
MB = -24 and higher fractions at brighter magnitudes. The reason for the high
radio-loud fraction at bright absolute magnitudes in the PG, compared to the
LBQS and other optically selected quasar surveys, is unknown. The trend of
increasing radio-loud fraction with absolute magnitude in the EMSS is due at
least in part to a correlation between X-ray and radio luminosity. Combining
the LBQS data with radio studies of high-redshift quasars leads to the
conclusion that the radio-loud fraction in optically selected quasars does not
appear to evolve significantly, aside from a modest increase at z ~1, from z =
0.2 to redshifts approaching 5, a result that is contrary to previous studies
which found a decrease in radio-loud fraction with increasing redshift by
comparing the low-z fraction in the PG to higher redshift samples.

Recently a theoretical calculation of k(t) for a single system, with an energy
average only, found interesting nonuniversal semiclassical effects at times t
approximately unity in units of {Planck's constant) /(mean level spacing). This
is of great interest if k(t) is self-averaging, i.e, if the properties of a

We here argue that this is not always the case, and that for many important

other systems, notably the Riemann zeta function, it is likely possible to see
the properties by an analysis of the spectrum.

the phenomenology of prions, proteins which exist in the cell in non-pathogenic
$\alpha$-helical conformation but under certain circumstances may transform
into pathogenic $PrP^{Sc}$ state featuring increased $\beta$-sheet content. We
designed sequences for lattice model proteins having two different
conformations of equal energy corresponding to the global energy minimum.
Folding simulations revealed that one of these conformations was indeed much
more kinetically accessible than the other. We found that the number and
strength of local contacts in the ground state conformation is the major factor
which determines which conformation is reached faster: The greater the number
of local contacts the more kinetically reachable a conformation is. We present
simple statistical-mechanical arguments to explain these findings. The
presented results are in a clear agreement with experimental data on prions and
other proteins exhibiting kinetic partitioning.

gauge-mediated soft masses are typically much greater than the Hubble parameter
during inflation. The dramatic role is played by the supersymmetry (SUSY)
breaking due to the parametric resonance effect, which ensures that the
inflaton predominantly decays into the bosons and not the fermions. Difference
in the Fermi-Bose occupation numbers results in the large gauge-mediated soft
masses, which determine the post-inflationary evolution of the flat directions,

valley instantons are not the solutions of equation of motion, they have

  illuminate debate by Penrose and Hawking on Schrodinger's cat in their book,
  ""The nature of space and time"", and 2. references extending my work inspired
  by Andreas Albrecht ""Following a Collapsing Wavefunction"" (hep-th/9309051). 6
  pages, latex, refers to hep-th/9309051",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A density operator, $\rho = {P}_{\alpha } |\alpha > <\alpha | + {P}_{\beta }
|\beta > <\beta |$, with ${P}_{\alpha }$ and ${P}_{\beta }$ linearly
independent normalized wave functions, must be traced normalized, so
${P}_{\beta } = 1 - {P}_{\alpha }$. However, unless $<\alpha |\beta > = 0$,
${P}_{\alpha }$ and ${P}_{\beta }$ cannot be interpreted as probabilities of
finding $|\alpha >$ and $|\beta >$ respectively.
  We show that a density matrix comprised of two (${P}_{\alpha }$ and
${P}_{\beta }$ nonzero) non-orthogonal projectors have unique spectral
decomposition into diagonal form with orthogonal projectors. Only then,
according to axioms of Von Neumann and Fock, can we have probability
interpretation of that density matrix, only then can the diagonal elements be
interpreted as probabilities of an ensemble.
  Those probabilities on the diagonal are not ${P}_{\alpha }$ and
${P}_{\beta}$. Further, only in the case of orthogonal projectors can we have
the degenerate situation in which multiple ensembles are permitted.

fields is used first to build the definition of these observables and then to
describe their relativistic properties under frame transformations. The
transformations to accelerated frames of the space-time observables depart from
the laws of classical relativity. The Einstein laws for the shifts of clock
rates and frequencies are recovered in the quantum description, and their
formulation provides a conformal metric factor behaving as a quantum
observable.

"solv-int/9606008","Stephanie F. Singer","M. Quinn and S.F. Singer","Loop algebras, gauge invariants and a new completely integrable system",,,,,"solv-int nlin.SI",,"  One fruitful motivating principle of much research on the family of
integrable systems known as ``Toda lattices'' has been the heuristic assumption
that the periodic Toda lattice in an affine Lie algebra is directly analogous
to the nonperiodic Toda lattice in a finite-dimensional Lie algebra. This paper
shows that the analogy is not perfect. A discrepancy arises because the natural
generalization of the structure theory of finite-dimensional simple Lie
algebras is not the structure theory of loop algebras but the structure theory
of affine Kac-Moody algebras. In this paper we use this natural generalization
to construct the natural analog of the nonperiodic Toda lattice. Surprisingly,
the result is not the periodic Toda lattice but a new completely integrable
system on the periodic Toda lattice phase space. This integrable system is
prescribed purely in terms of Lie-theoretic data. The commuting functions are
precisely the gauge-invariant functions one obtains by viewing elements of the
loop algebra as connections on a bundle over $S^1$.
