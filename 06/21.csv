standard models) which is probably due to an (evolving) population of sub-L*
galaxies at moderate redshifts (<~ 0.4). One particular hypothesis which is
hard to test directly via number counts or even redshift surveys is the
possibility that the faint blue galaxies are in fact sub-galactic objects
destined to merge by the present day to form current giant galaxies. If this
were the case we might expect to find the faint blue galaxies in the vicinity
of ~ L* galaxies (at redshifts =~ 0.2 to 0.4) with which they can merge (the
blue galaxies are already known to be weakly clustered among themselves,
limiting the possibility for multiple mergers of small fragments).
  In this paper we look for evidence of such clustering of faint blue galaxies
around larger systems using candidates chosen photometrically from deep
multicolour CCD images using the Hitchhiker parallel camera. A sample of
candidate L$^\ast$ galaxies expected to lie at redshifts z =~ 0.2 to 0.4 has

colours typical of early-type spirals. The distribution of 152 blue galaxies

galaxies about the L* candidates; the observed overdensity within 60 arcsec of
the L* candidates is -0.02 +/- 0.76 per candidate. We have also looked for
clustering between other photometrically selected samples (such as faint blue
and faint red objects). Null results have been found in all cases, placing
significant limits on the scenarios wherein dwarfs at medium redshifts are
removed via mergers with larger objects.

measurements in curved space-time. In particular, we discuss a new iterative
approach for describing the dynamics of an astronomical N-body system. To do
this, we generalize the Fock-Chandrasekhar method of the weak-field and
slow-motion approximation (WFSMA) and develop a theory of relativistic
reference frames (RF) for a gravitationally bounded many-extended-body problem.
In any proper RF constructed in the immediate vicinity of an arbitrary body,
the N-body solutions of the gravitational field equations are presented as a
sum of the Riemann-flat inertial space-time, the gravitational field generated
by the body itself, the unperturbed solutions for each body in the system
transformed to the coordinates of this proper RF, and the gravitational
interaction term. We develop the basic concept of a general theory of the
celestial RFs applicable to a wide class of metric theories of gravity with an
arbitrary model of matter distribution. We apply the proposed method to general
relativity. Bodies are described using a perfect fluid model; as such, they
possess any number of internal mass and current multipole moments which
explicitly characterize their internal structure. The obtained relativistic
equations of motion contain an explicit information about the coupling of the
bodies proper multiple moments to the surrounding gravitational field. We
further generalize the proposed method and include two Eddington parameters
$(\gamma,\beta)$. This generalized approach was used to derive the relativistic
equations of satellite motion in the vicinity of the extended bodies. We
discuss the possible future implementation of the proposed formalism in
software codes developed for solar-system orbit determination.

supporting that such microscopic correlations of lattice QCD Dirac spectra are
given by chiral random matrix theory. First, we find that the spectral
correlations of eigenvalues in the bulk of the spectrum obey the
Dyson-Mehta-Wigner statistics. Second, we show that the valence quark mass
dependence for sufficiently small quark masses, as calculated by the Columbia

matrix theory. Third, in the framework of chiral random matrix models, we
present results showing that the microscopic spectral density is strongly

on approximating the renormalization scheme (RS) invariant effective charge
beta-function coefficients by the portion containing the highest power of

This can be accomplished using exact large-$N_{f}$ all-orders results. The
resulting resummation is RS-invariant and the exact next-to-leading order (NLO)
and next-to-NLO (NNLO) coefficients in any RS are included. This improves on a
previously employed naive resummation of the leading-$b$ piece of the
perturbative coefficients which is RS-dependent, making its comparison with
fixed-order perturbative results ambiguous. The RS-invariant resummation is
used to assess the reliability of fixed-order perturbation theory for the
$e^{+}e^{-}$ $R$-ratio, the analogous $\tau$-lepton decay ratio $R_{\tau}$, and
Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) sum rules, by comparing it with the exact NNLO
results in the effective charge RS. For the $R$-ratio and $R_{\tau}$, where
large-order perturbative behaviour is dominated by a leading ultra-violet
renormalon singularity, the comparison indicates fixed-order perturbation
theory to be very reliable. For DIS sum rules, which have a leading infra-red
renormalon singularity, the performance is rather poor. In this way we estimate
that at LEP/SLD energies ideal data on the $R$-ratio could determine
$\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})$ to three-significant figures, and for the $R_{\tau}$ we
estimate a theoretical uncertainty $\delta\alpha_{s}(m_{\tau})\simeq0.008$
corresponding to $\delta\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\simeq0.001$. This encouragingly small
uncertainty is much less than has recently been deduced from comparison with
the ambiguous naive resummation.

with magnetic boundary conditions. The contributions of transverse,
longitudinal and normal modes of the electromagnetic potential, jointly with
ghost modes, are derived in detail. The most difficult part of the analysis
consists in the eigenvalue condition given by the determinant of a $2 \times 2$

former splits into a sum of Dirichlet and Robin contributions, plus a simpler

magnetic boundary conditions are imposed on two bounding three-spheres, the
determinant is more involved. Nevertheless, it is evaluated explicitly as well.
The whole analysis provides the building block for studying the one-loop

of the Green-Schwarz string in $3+1$ dimensions. In M-theory the string
decoupled from gravity arises when two 5-branes intersect over a
three-dimensional hyperplane. The two 5-branes may be connected by a 2-brane,
whose boundary becomes a tensionless string with $N=2$ supersymmetry in $3+1$
dimensions. Non-critical strings on the intersection may also come from
dynamical 5-branes intersecting the two 5-branes over a string and wrapped over
a four-torus. The near-extremal entropy of the intersecting 5-branes is
explained by the non-critical strings originating from the wrapped 5-branes.

field theories. In one dimension we construct a combinatorial version of a
non-trivial field theory on the circle which is of some independent interest in
itself while in two dimensions we consider a field theory on a toroidal
triangular lattice. We take a continuous spin Gaussian model on a toroidal
triangular lattice with periods $L_0$ and $L_1$ where the spins carry a
representation of the fundamental group of the torus labeled by phases $u_0$
and $u_1$. We compute the {\it exact finite size and lattice corrections}, to
the partition function $Z$, for arbitrary mass $m$ and phases $u_i$. Summing
$Z^{-1/2}$ over a specified set of phases gives the corresponding result for
the Ising model on a torus. An interesting property of the model is that the
limits $m\rightarrow0$ and $u_i\rightarrow0$ do not commute. Also when $m=0$
the model exhibits a {\it vortex critical phase} when at least one of the $u_i$
is non-zero. In the continuum or scaling limit, for arbitrary $m$, the finite
size corrections to $-\ln Z$ are {\it modular invariant} and for the critical
phase are given by elliptic theta functions. In the cylinder limit
$L_1\rightarrow\infty$ the ``cylinder charge'' $c(u_0,m^2L_0^2)$ is a
non-monotonic function of $m$ that ranges from $2(1+6u_0(u_0-1))$ for $m=0$ to
zero for $m\rightarrow\infty$ but from which one can determine the central
charge $c$. The study of the continuum limit of these field theories provides a
kind of quantum theoretic analog of the link between certain combinatorial and
analytic topological quantities.

calculations using multigrid accelerations and a real-space grid as a basis.
The multigrid methods provide effective convergence acceleration and
preconditioning on all length scales, thereby permitting efficient calculations
for ill-conditioned systems with long length scales or high energy cut-offs. We
discuss specific implementations of multigrid and real-space algorithms for
electronic structure calculations, including an efficient multigrid-accelerated
solver for Kohn-Sham equations, compact yet accurate discretization schemes for
the Kohn-Sham and Poisson equations, optimized pseudo\-potentials for
real-space calculations, efficacious computation of ionic forces, and a
complex-wavefunction implementation for arbitrary sampling of the Brillioun
zone. A particular strength of a real-space multigrid approach is its ready
adaptability to massively parallel computer architectures, and we present an
implementation for the Cray-T3D with essentially linear scaling of the
execution time with the number of processors. The method has been applied to a
variety of periodic and non-periodic systems, including disordered Si, a N
impurity in diamond, AlN in the wurtzite structure, and bulk Al. The high
accuracy of the atomic forces allows for large step molecular dynamics; e.g.,
in a 1 ps simulation of Si at 1100 K with an ionic step of 80 a.u., the total
energy was conserved within 27 microeV per atom.

effective field theory treatments of two or more heavy particles (such as
nucleons). It is desirable to regulate the contact interactions from the outset
by treating them as having a finite range. The low energy physical observables
should be insensitive to this range provided that the range is of a similar or
greater scale than that of the interaction. Alternative schemes, such as
dimensional regularization, lead to paradoxical conclusions such as the
impossibility of repulsive interactions for truly low energy effective theories
where all of the exchange particles are integrated out. This difficulty arises
because a nonrelativistic field theory with repulsive contact interactions is
trivial in the sense that the $S$ matrix is unity and the renormalized coupling
constant zero. Possible consequences of low energy attraction are also
discussed. It is argued that in the case of large or small scattering lengths,
the region of validity of effective field theory expansion is much larger if
the contact interactions are given a finite range from the beginning.
