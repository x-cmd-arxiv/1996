hydrogen burning reactions, predictions of standard solar models and results of
solar neutrino experiments, we discuss the solar-model-independent indications
in favour of non-standard neutrino properties. The experimental results look to
be in contradiction with each other, even disregarding some experiment: unless
electron neutrinos disappear in their trip from the sun to the earth, the
fluxes of intermediate energy neutrinos (those from 7Be electron capture and
from the CNO cycle) result to be unphysically negative, or anyway extremely
reduced with respect to standard solar model predictions. Next we review
extensively non-standard solar models built as attempts to solve the solar
neutrino puzzle. The dependence of the central solar temperature on chemical
composition, opacity, age and on the values of the astrophysical S-factors for
hydrogen-burning reactions is carefully investigated. Also, possible
modifications of the branching among the various pp-chains in view of nuclear
physics uncertainties are examined. Assuming standard neutrinos, all solar
models examined fail in reconciling theory with experiments, even when the
physical and chemical inputs are radically changed with respect to present
knowledge and even if some of the experimental results are discarded.

of equal-mass binary neutron stars are performed, including a physical
high-density equation of state and a treatment of the neutrino emission of the
heated matter. The total neutrino luminosity climbs to a maximum value of
1--$1.5\cdot 10^{53}$~erg/s of which 90--95\% originate from the toroidal gas
cloud surrounding the very dense core formed after the merging. When the
neutrino luminosities are highest, $\nu\bar\nu$-annihilation deposits about
0.2--0.3\% of the emitted neutrino energy in the immediate neighborhood of the
merger, and the maximum integral energy deposition rate is 3--$4\cdot
10^{50}$~erg/s. Since the $3\,M_{\odot}$ core of the merged object will most
likely collapse into a black hole within milliseconds, the energy that can be
pumped into a pair-photon fireball is insufficient by a factor of about 1000 to
explain $\gamma$-ray bursts at cosmological distances with an energy of the
order of $10^{51}/(4\pi)$~erg/steradian. Analytical estimates show that the
additional energy provided by the annihilation of $\nu\bar\nu$ pairs emitted
from a possible accretion torus of $\sim 0.1\,M_{\odot}$ around the central
black hole is still more than a factor of 10 too small, unless focussing of the
fireball into a jet-like expansion plays an important role. About
$10^{-4}$--$10^{-3}$~$M_\odot$ of material lost during the neutron star merging
and swept out from the system in a neutrino-driven wind might be a site for
nucleosythesis. Aspects of a possible r-processing in these ejecta are
discussed.

We compute the complete solution to the Quantum Einstein Equations for the

action of the Wheeler-DeWitt constraint on spin-network states is by
annihilating, creating and rerouting the quanta of angular momentum associated
with the edges of the underlying graph while the ADM-energy is essentially
diagonalized by the spin-network states. We argue that the spin-network
representation is the ``non-linear Fock representation"" of quantum gravity,
thus justifying the term ``Quantum Spin Dynamics (QSD)"".
