analytic Simple model of chemical evolution fail to match observations of the
nuclei of bulge-dominated galaxies in three respects. First, the spectral
energy distribution in the mid-ultraviolet range 2000 < lam < 2400 exceeds
observation by ~ 0.6 mag. Most of that excess is due to metal-poor main
sequence stars. Second, the models do not reproduce metal-sensitive optical
absorption features that arise mainly from red giant stars. Third, the strength
of a Ca II index sensitive to hot stars does not jibe with the predicted number
of A-type horizontal branch stars. The number of metal poor stars in galaxies
is at least a factor of two less than predicted by the Simple model, exactly
similar to the ``G Dwarf problem'' in the solar cylinder. Observations at
larger radii in local group galaxies indicate that the paucity of metal poor
stars applies globally, rather than only in the nuclei. Because of the
dominance of metal rich stars, primordial galaxies will have a plentiful dust
supply early in their star formation history, and thus will probably have weak
Lyman-alpha emission, as is apparently observed. We confirm that early-type
galaxies cannot have been formed exclusively from mergers of small all-stellar
subsystems, a result already established by dynamical simulations. The
constraint of peaked abundance distributions will limit future chemical
evolution models. It will also make age estimates for the stellar populations
in early type galaxies and bulges more secure.

such a way that the evolution of the inflaton field is determined by the value
of the Planck mass in different regions of the universe. The Planck mass is
given by the values of the Brans--Dicke field, which is coupled to the scalar
curvature in the Lagrangian. We first calculate the joint probability
distributions of the inflaton and Brans--Dicke fields, in order to compute the
3--volume ratios of homogeneous regions with arbitrary values of the fields
still undergoing inflation with respect to thermalized regions. From these
volume ratios one is able to extract information on the values of the fields
measured by a typical observer for a given potential and, in particular, the
typical value of the Planck mass at the end of inflation. In this paper, we
investigate volume ratios using a regularization procedure suggested by
Vilenkin, and the results are applied to powerlaw and double--well potentials.
The spectrum of density fluctuations is calculated for generic potentials, and
we discuss the likelihood of various scenarios that could tell us whether our
region of the universe is typical or untypical depending on very general bounds
on the evolution of the Brans--Dicke field.

presented. It relies on a realistic treatment of collapse dynamics.
Gravitational collapse is analyzed in the Lagrangian perturbative framework.
Lagrangian perturbations provide an approximation of truncated type, i.e.
small-scale structure is filtered out. The collapse time is suitably defined as
the instant at which orbit crossing takes place. The convergence of the
Lagrangian series in predicting the collapse time of a homogeneous ellipsoid is
demonstrated; it is also shown that third-order calculations are necessary in
predicting collapse. Then, the Lagrangian prediction, with a correction for
quasi-spherical perturbations, can be used to determine the collapse time of a
homogeneous ellipsoid in a fast and precise way. Furthermore, ellipsoidal
collapse can be considered as a particular truncation of the Lagrangian series.
Gaussian fields with scale-free power spectra are then considered. The
Lagrangian series for the collapse time is found to converge when the collapse
time is not large. In this case, ellipsoidal collapse gives a fast and accurate
approximation of the collapse time; spherical collapse is found to poorly
reproduce the collapse time, even in a statistical sense. Analytical fits of
the distribution functions of the inverse collapse times, as predicted by the
ellipsoid model and by third-order Lagrangian theory, are given. These will be
necessary for a determination of the mass function, which will be given in

paper I of this series by means of the powerful Lagrangian perturbation theory

is the inverse collapse time F; it is a non-linear functional of the initial
potential, with a non-Gaussian distribution. In the case of sharp k-space
smoothing, it is demonstrated that the fraction of collapsed mass can be
determined by extending to the F process the diffusion formalism introduced by
Bond et al. (1991). The problem is then reduced to a random walk with a moving
absorbing barrier, and numerically solved; an accurate analytical fit, valid
for small and moderate resolutions, is found. For Gaussian smoothing, the F
trajectories are strongly correlated in resolution. In this case, an
approximation proposed by Peacock & Heavens (1990) can be used to determine the
mass functions. Gaussian smoothing is preferred, as it optimizes the
performances of dynamical predictions and stabilizes the F trajectories. The
relation between resolution and mass is treated at a heuristic level, and the
consequences of this approximation are discussed. The resulting mass functions,
compared to the classical Press & Schechter (1974) one, are shifted toward
large masses (confirming the findings of Monaco 1995), and tend to give more
intermediate-mass objects at the expense of small-mass objects. However, the
small-mass part of the mass function, which depends on uncertain dynamics and
is likely to be affected by uncertainties in the resolution--mass relation, is
not considered a robust prediction of this theory.

dispersion through cross-correlation with a template star; the result is
$\sigma_*$ = 11.4$\pm$1.5 \kms. Assuming that the system is gravitationally

analysis of neutrino mixing. The solution found is unique and completely
determines the mass eigenstates as well as the mixing matrix relating mass and
flavour eigenstates. Assuming the mass eigenstates to follow the hierarchy

in agreement with the leptonic quadratic hierarchy of the see-saw model and
large enough to render energy-independent any oscillation-induced phenomenon in
solar neutrino physics observable on Earth. This possibility is not excluded by
the present knowledge of solar neutrino physics. The mixing angles are

matrix-valued covector field, which is bilinear in quarks, antiquarks and their

potential, and can be, therefore, considered as the gauge potential ``dressed''

photoproduction on the deuteron in the $\Delta$(1232) resonance region. The
model consists of a system of coupled equations for the N$\Delta$, NN$\pi$ and
NN channels. Pion rescattering leads in general to a significant reduction of
total and differential cross sections resulting in a better description of
experimental data. Only a few polarization observables are sensitive to
rescattering effects. In particular $T_{20}$ allows an analysis of the reaction
mechanism for specific kinematics. The question how rescattering affects the
sensitivity to the E2 excitation of the $\Delta$ resonance is also studied.

protocol on a noisy channel against the most general attack allowed by quantum
physics. We use the fact that in a previous paper we have reduced the proof of
the unconditionally security of this QKD protocol to a proof that a
corresponding Quantum String Oblivious Transfer (String-QOT) protocol would be
unconditionally secure against Bob if implemented on top of an unconditionally
secure bit commitment scheme. We prove a lemma that extends a security proof
given by Yao for a (one bit) QOT protocol to this String-QOT protocol. This
result and the reduction mentioned above implies the unconditional security of
our QKD protocol despite our previous proof that unconditionally secure bit
commitment schemes are impossible.

non-relativistic quantum mechanics as a stochastic theory. The sample space
corresponds to a decomposition, as a sum of orthogonal projectors, of the
identity operator on a Hilbert space of histories. Provided a consistency
condition is satisfied, the corresponding Boolean algebra of histories, called
a {\it framework}, can be assigned probabilities in the usual way, and within a
single framework quantum reasoning is identical to ordinary probabilistic
reasoning. A refinement rule, which allows a probability distribution to be
extended from one framework to a larger (refined) framework, incorporates the
dynamical laws of quantum theory. Two or more frameworks which are incompatible
because they possess no common refinement cannot be simultaneously employed to
describe a single physical system.
