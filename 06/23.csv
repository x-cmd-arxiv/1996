1795. An irregular, asymmetric dust lane extends 7 \h75 kpc in projection to
the north-northwest. The dust shares the morphology observed in the H$\alpha$
and excess UV emission. We see both diffuse and knotty blue emission around the
dust lane, especially at the ends. The dust and emission features lie on the
edge of the radio lobes, suggesting star formation induced by the radio source
or the deflection of the radio jets off of pre-existing dust and gas. We
measure an apparent R$_V$ significantly less than 3.1, implying that the
extinction law is not Galactic in the dust lane, or the presence of line
emission which is proportional to the extinction. The dust mass is at least
2$\times10^{5} h_{75}^{-2}$ M\solar\ and is more likely to be 6.5$\times10^{5}
h_{75}^{-2}$ M\solar.

polars ST LMi and MR Ser, from which we find the semi-amplitudes to be
K_abs=329=+/-6 kms-1 and K_abs=289+/-9 kms-1 respectively. We find that for
both systems the effects on the \NaI absorption lines due to X-rays heating the
inner face of the secondary are negligible, and so the values obtained for
K_abs can be taken as the true semi-amplitude of the secondary star. We then
determine the projected rotational velocities, vsini, to be 104+/-9 kms-1 and
66+/-13 kms-1 for ST LMi and MR Ser respectively which enables their mass
ratios to be calculated. For ST LMi and MR Ser we find the mass ratio to be
0.22+/-0.04 and 0.10+/-0.05 respectively; values which are significantly
different only at the 94 percent level. We show that ``spike'' in the orbital
period distribution of polars is a significant feature, although the discovery
of only one more system with a period outside the ``spike'' would decrease its
significance below a 99 percent confidence level. We conclude that, even if the
limb darkening coefficients for the secondary stars in ST LMi and MR Ser are
the same, we cannot rule out the two systems having identical parameters.
Therefore our observations are compatible with the theory explaining the
``spike'' in the period distribution of the AM Hers.

"cmp-lg/9606029",,"Lauri Karttunen","Directed Replacement","To appear in the Proceedings of ACL-96",,,,"cmp-lg cs.CL",,"  This paper introduces to the finite-state calculus a family of directed
replace operators. In contrast to the simple replace expression, UPPER ->
LOWER, defined in Karttunen (ACL-95), the new directed version, UPPER @->
LOWER, yields an unambiguous transducer if the lower language consists of a
single string. It transduces the input string from left to right, making only
the longest possible replacement at each point.
  A new type of replacement expression, UPPER @-> PREFIX ... SUFFIX, yields a
transducer that inserts text around strings that are instances of UPPER. The
symbol ... denotes the matching part of the input which itself remains
unchanged. PREFIX and SUFFIX are regular expressions describing the insertions.
  Expressions of the type UPPER @-> PREFIX ... SUFFIX may be used to compose a
deterministic parser for a ``local grammar'' in the sense of Gross (1989).
Other useful applications of directed replacement include tokenization and
filtering of text streams.

of double inflation, depending on three parameters. The observed dipole and
quadrupole can be explained in this model, while severely constraining its

four-dimensional (4D) pure compact U(1) gauge theory on spherical lattices. The
action contains the Wilson coupling beta and the double charge coupling gamma.
The lattice is obtained from the 4D surface of the 5D cubic lattice by its
radial projection onto a 4D sphere, and made homogeneous by means of
appropriate weight factors for individual plaquette contributions to the
action. On such lattices the two-state signal, impeding the studies of this
theory on toroidal lattices, is absent for gamma le 0. Furthermore, here a
consistent finite-size scaling behavior of several bulk observables is found,
with the correlation length exponent nu in the range nu = 0.35 - 40. These
observables include Fisher zeros, specific-heat and cumulant extrema as well as
pseudocritical values of beta at fixed gamma. The most reliable determination
of nu by means of the Fisher zeros gives nu = 0.365(8). The phase transition at
gamma le 0 is thus very probably of 2nd order and belongs to the universality
class of a non-Gaussian fixed point.

We first motivate the particle content
of the theory by examining the quantum numbers of the known standard model
particles and by the requirement of anomaly cancellation. Once the particle
content is fixed we can write down the most general renormalizable
superpotential. However such a superpotential will contain terms breaking
lepton and baryon number which leads us to the concept of R-parity
conservation. The question of supersymmetry breaking is discussed next. We list
the possible soft breaking terms. However the Lagrangian involving the most
general soft breaking terms is phenomenologically intractable because of the
appearance of the many new parameters. It also leads to some unacceptable
predictions. To reduce the number of parameters we restrict ourself to the case
with universal soft breaking terms at the GUT scale. We motivate the need for
universal soft breaking terms by the apparent unification of gauge couplings in
the MSSM and by the absence of flavor changing neutral currents. Then we
discuss radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. Radiative breaking arises
because the one loop corrections involving the large top Yukawa coupling change
the sign of the soft breaking mass parameter of the up-type Higgs doublet, this
way introducing a nontrivial minimum in the Higgs potential. Finally we give an
overview of the possible mixings in the MSSM and enumerate the physical (mass
eigenstate) fields together with the mass matrices.

inflation are so large that they can break supersymmetry much stronger than
inflation itself. These fluctuations may lead to symmetry restoration along
flat directions of the effective potential even in the theories where the usual
high temperature corrections are exponentially suppressed. Our results show
that nonthermal phase transitions after preheating may play a crucial role in
the generation of the primordial baryon asymmetry by the Affleck-Dine
mechanism. In particular, the baryon asymmetry may be generated at the very
early stage of the evolution of the Universe, at the preheating era, and not
when the Hubble parameter becomes of order the gravitino mass.

above the field corresponding to the peak in the ''fishtail'' magnetization. In
this range the activation energy $U_{pl}$, which decreases with field, drops
below the elastic (collective) creep activation energy, $U_{el}$, which
