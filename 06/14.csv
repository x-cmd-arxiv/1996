surprising connection between the work of Buser and Sarnak on lengths of
periods of abelian varieties and the Seshadri constants measuring the local
positivity of theta divisors. The link is established via symplectic blowing
up, in the spirit of McDuff and Polterovich. As an application of the main
inequality, we get a simple new proof of a statement of Buser-Sarnak type to
the effect that the Jacobian of a curve has a period of unusually small length.
We also deduce a lower bound on the Seshadri constant of a very general
p.p.a.v. which differs from the maximum possible by a factor of less than four.

$w(\theta)$ over the magnitude range $20 <R< 29$ is consistent with linear
evolution of the clustering of a galaxy population which at present has a
correlation length $r_0$ of about 4 h^(-1) Mpc, close to that of local IRAS
galaxies. We also investigate the impact that magnification bias induced by
weak gravitational lensing may have on our results. Although the observed
amplitude of $w(\theta)$ can differ from the true amplitude by up to 30%, this
effect is not large enough to affect our conclusions. Finally, by using a
color-selected sample, we examine whether the expected effects of magnification
bias can be used for an independent determination of cosmological parameters in
deep images. We conclude that the amplitude of the effect can be large and in
some cases even produce an upturn of the amplitude of the correlation with
limiting magnitude. However, we find that it is not possible to detect the
effects of magnification bias on $w(\theta)$ from images alone. If redshift
information becomes available, it is possible to measure the effects of
magnification bias directly and thus constrain the density parameter $\Omega_0$

described by the mass density contrast, $\de$. The velocity field is described
by the variable $\te$ proportional to the velocity divergence, $\te = -
f(\Omega)^{-1} H_0^{-1} \nabla\cdot\bfv$, where $f(\Omega) \simeq
\Omega^{0.6}$, $\Omega$ is the cosmological density parameter and $H_0$ is the
Hubble constant. Our calculations show that mean $\de$ given $\te$ is a third
order polynomial in $\te$, $\lan \de \ran|_{\te} = a_1 \te + a_2 (\te^2 -
\s_\te^2) + a_3 \te^3$. This result constitutes an extension of the formula
$\lan \de \ran|_{\te} = \te + a_2 (\te^2 - \s_\te^2)$, found by
Bernardeau~(1992) which involved second order perturbative solutions. Third
order perturbative corrections introduce the cubic term. They also, however,
cause the coefficient $a_1$ to depart from unity, in contrast with the linear
theory prediction. We compute the values of the coefficients $a_p$ for
scale-free power spectra, as well as for standard CDM, for Gaussian smoothing.
The coefficients obey a hierarchy $a_3 \ll a_2 \ll a_1$, meaning that the
perturbative series converges very fast. Their dependence on $\Omega$ is
expected to be very weak. The values of the coefficients for CDM spectrum are
in qualitative agreement with the results of N-body simulations by Ganon et al.

(MOND). Combined with the previous highly selected sample of Begeman et al.
(1990), this comprises the current total sample of galaxies with published (or
available) extended rotation curves and photometric observations of the light
distribution. This is the observational basis of present quantitative
understanding of the discrepancy between the visible mass and classical
dynamical mass in galaxies. It is found that the gravitational force calculated
from the observed distribution of luminous material and gas using the simple
MOND formula can account for the overall shape and amplitude of these 22
rotation curves, and in some cases, the predicted curve agrees with the
observed rotation curve in detail. The fitted rotation curves have, in 13
cases, only one free parameter which is the mass-to-light ratio of the luminous
disk; in nine cases, there is an additional free parameter which is M/L of a
central bulge or light concentration. The values of the global M/L (bulge plus
disk) are reasonable and, when the gas mass is also included, show a scatter
which is consistent with that in the Tully-Fisher relation. The success of the
MOND prescription in predicting the rotation curves in this larger, less
stringently selected sample, lends further support to the idea that dynamics or
gravity is non-Newtonian in the limit of low accelerations and that it is
unnecessary to invoke the presence of large quantities of unseen matter.

results show that the topological term induces spin and that the total spin J
(which is the spin observed by an asymptotic observer) ranges from 0 to $\sigma
+ \frac{m}{\mu}(\frac{4\pi+m}{4\pi +2m})$ depending on the structure of the
spin source (here $\mu$ is the topological mass). We find that it is
inconsistent to consider actual delta function mass and spin sources. In the
point-like limit, however, we find no condition constraining $m$ and $\sigma$
contrary to a previous analysis by Clement.

upon the molecular dynamics trajectories within it being exactly reversible. If
computations were carried out with exact arithmetic then it would be easy to
ensure such reversibility, but the use of approximate floating point arithmetic
inevitably introduces violations of reversibility. In the absence of evidence
to the contrary, we are usually prepared to accept that such rounding errors
can be made small enough to be innocuous, but in certain circumstances they are
exponentially amplified and lead to blatantly erroneous results. We show that
there are two types of instability of the molecular dynamics trajectories which
lead to this behavior, instabilities due to insufficiently accurate numerical
integration of Hamilton's equations, and intrinsic chaos in the underlying
continuous fictitious time equations of motion themselves. We analyze the
former for free field theory, and show that it is essentially a finite volume
effect. For the latter we propose a hypothesis as to how the Liapunov exponent
describing the chaotic behavior of the fictitious time equations of motion for
an asymptotically free quantum field theory behaves as the system is taken to
its continuum limit, and explain why this means that instabilities in molecular
dynamics trajectories are not a significant problem for Hybrid Monte Carlo
computations. We present data for pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory and for QCD with
dynamical fermions on small lattices to illustrate and confirm some of our
results.

reduction in B(D0 --> K- Pi+) would also mean that roughly 15% of all D0 and D+

missing decay modes involve multiple charged particles, they would be more
likely to pass the requirements for lifetime B tagging at LEP and SLC. This

in pure non-Abelian Chern-Simons theory in an arbitrary covariant gauge. We
find that the results are dependent on both the gauge parameter ($\alpha$) and
the metric required in the gauge fixing. A contribution arises that has not
been previously encountered; it is of the form $(\alpha / \sqrt{p^2}) \epsilon
_{\mu \lambda \nu} p^\lambda$. This is possible as in three dimensions $\alpha$
is dimensionful. A variant of proper time regularization is used to render
these integrals well behaved (although no divergences occur when the
regularization is turned off at the end of the calculation). Since the original
Lagrangian is unaltered in this approach, no symmetries of the classical theory
are explicitly broken and $\epsilon_{\mu \lambda \nu}$ is handled unambiguously
since the system is three dimensional at all stages of the calculation. The
results are shown to be consistent with the so-called Nielsen identities which
predict the explicit gauge parameter dependence using an extension of BRS
symmetry. We demonstrate that this $\alpha$ dependence may potentially
contribute to the vacuum expectation values of products of Wilson loops.

we show that $d=4, \mathcal{N}=2$ hypermultiplets induce a theory of self-dual

performed by letting the parameter of the group $ m \rightarrow \lambda $ while

of the self coupling constant.

nuclear matter as non-overlapping MIT bags bound by the self-consistent
exchange of scalar and vector mesons is modified by the introduction of a
density dependent bag constant. It is found that when the bag constant is
significantly reduced in nuclear medium with respect to its free space value,
large canceling isoscalar Lorentz scalar and vector potentials for the nucleon
in nuclear matter emerge naturally. Such potentials are comparable to those
suggested by relativistic nuclear phenomenology. This suggests that the
modification of the bag constant in the nuclear medium may play an important
role in low- and medium-energy nuclear physics.
