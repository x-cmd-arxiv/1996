spectra, linear growth rates, and rms mass fluctuations for both components in
a family of cold+hot dark matter (CDM+HDM) models that are of current
cosmological interest. The formulas are valid for a wide range of wavenumber,
neutrino fraction, redshift, and Hubble constant: $k\lo 10\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$,
$0.05\lo \onu\lo 0.3$, $0\le z\lo 15$, and $0.5\lo h \lo 0.8$. A new,
redshift-dependent shape parameter $\Gamma_\nu=a^{1/2}\onu h^2$ is introduced
to simplify the multi-dimensional parameter space and to characterize the
effect of massive neutrinos on the power spectrum. The physical origin of
$\Gamma_\nu$ lies in the neutrino free-streaming process, and the analytic
approximations can be simplified to depend only on this variable and $\onu$.
Linear calculations with these power spectra as input are performed to compare
the predictions of $\onu\lo 0.3$ models with observational constraints from the
reconstructed linear power spectrum and cluster abundance. The usual assumption
of an exact scale-invariant primordial power spectrum is relaxed to allow a
spectral index of $0.8\lo n\le 1$. It is found that a slight tilt of $n=0.9$
(no tensor mode) or $n=0.95$ (with tensor mode) in $\onu\sim 0.1-0.2$ CDM+HDM
models gives a power spectrum similar to that of an open CDM model with a shape
parameter $\Gamma=0.25$, providing good agreement with the power spectrum
reconstructed by Peacock and Dodds (1994) and the observed cluster abundance.

accretion of the inter-stellar medium and the ambient magnetic field, an
isolated black hole is expected to emit a blended, thermal synchrotron spectrum

that the Sloan Survey will be able to detect isolated black holes, in the
considered mass range of 1--100$M_{\odot}$, out to a few hundred parsecs,
depending on the local conditions of the ISM. We also find that the black holes
are photmetrically distinguishable from field stars and they have a photometry
similar to QSOs. They can be further singled out from QSO searches because they
have a featureless spectrum with no emission lines. The Sloan Survey will
likely find hundreds of objects that meet these criteria, and to further reduce
the number of candidates, we suggest other selection criteria such as infra-red
searches and proper motion measurements. Estimates indicate that dozens of
black holes may exist out to a few hundred parsecs. If no black hole candidates
are found in this survey, important limits can be placed on the local density
of black holes and the halo fraction in black holes, especially for masses
greater than about $20 M_{\odot}$.

fact that the gravitational lensing effect by the environmental matter
surrounding these objects has been ignored. In this paper we conduct an
extensive study of the influence of the environmental matter on the prediction
of quasar enhancement factor by employing the spatial two-point correlation
function. Assuming a singular isothermal sphere for mass density profile in
galaxy and cluster of galaxies, we estimate the average surface mass density
$\overline{\Sigma}$ around galaxies, clusters and quasars from the

density parameters of galaxies ($\Omega_g$) and clusters of galaxies
($\Omega_c$) in the universe. For a flat cosmological model of $\Omega_0=1$ the
environmental matter can indeed play an important role in the lensing origin of

become correlated over distances comparable to the characteristic macroscopic

this phenomenon, we construct a microscopic model with simple stochastic
dynamics using lattice gas automaton rules that satisfy local detailed balance.
Because of the simplicity of the automaton dynamics, analytical theory can be
developed to describe the space and time evolution of the density fluctuations.
The exact equations for the pair correlations are solved explicitly in the
hydrodynamic limit. In this limit, we rigorously derive the results obtained
phenomenologically by fluctuating hydrodynamics. In particular, the spatial
algebraic decay of the equal-time fluctuation correlations predicted by this
theory is found to be in excellent agreement with the results of our lattice

when a stationary vortex is immersed in a transport supercurrent. If the core
spectrum were continuous, spectral flow would convert the momentum flowing into
the core via the Magnus effect into unbound quasiparticles --- thus allowing
the vortex to remain stationary without a pinning potential or other sink for
the inflowing momentum. The discrete nature of the states, however, leads to
Bloch oscillations which thwart the spectral flow. The momentum can escape only
via relaxation processes. Taking these into account permits a physically
transparent derivation of the mutual friction coefficients.

leading to a charge-spin ($t-J-V$) model which for most geometries reduces to a

involve cyclic rotations of a ``ring'' of neighboring electrons. This is
achieved by introducing intermediate lattice points and the importance of ring
processes relative to pair-exchange processes is investigated using high-order

be due to the production of charginos or neutralinos, followed by their decay
into quark jets through baryon number-violating ($\lambda^{\prime\prime}$)
couplings. An estimate at the parton level shows, however, that these events
cannot be due to neutralinos because of the low cross-section, and is unlikely
to be due to the production of chargino pairs because of the largely different
event shapes.

to a given system is suggested. It is based on the eigenvalue distribution of
the relevant Hessian evaluated at the streamline configurations (configurations
that almost satisfy the classical equations of motion). The semiclassical
approximation is consistent when there exists a gap that separates small and
large eigenvalues and the spreading among the small eigenvalues is much smaller
than the gap. The idea is illustrated in the case of the double-well potential
problem in quantum mechanics. The feasibility of the present idea to test
instanton models of QCD vacuum is also briefly discussed.

can be readily produced in collider experiments even if the squarks are
arbitrarily heavy. This enhances the jet transverse energy distributions. In
addition the slower running of the strong coupling constant in the presence of
light gluinos leads to a further enhancement at higher transverse energies
relative to the standard $QCD$ expectations. Finally, the enhanced squark
gluino production would lead to a Jacobian peak in the $E_T$ distribution at
about $M_{\tilde Q}/2$. These effects are of about the right magnitude to
explain anomalies observed by the $CDF$ and $D0$ collaborations.

D54 (1996) 6351-6371","10.1103/PhysRevD.54.6351","CU-TP-755","hep-th",,"  We use the multimonopole moduli space as a tool for studying the properties
of BPS monopoles carrying nonabelian magnetic charges. For configurations whose
total magnetic charge is purely abelian, the moduli space for nonabelian
breaking can be obtained as a smooth limit of that for a purely abelian
breaking. As the asymptotic Higgs field is varied toward one of the special
values for which the unbroken symmetry is enlarged to a nonabelian group, some
of the fundamental monopoles of unit topological charge remain massive but
acquire nonabelian magnetic charges. The BPS mass formula indicates that others
should become massless in this limit. We find that these do not correspond to
distinct solitons but instead manifest themselves as ``nonabelian clouds''
surrounding the massive monopoles. The moduli space coordinates describing the
position and $U(1)$ phase of these massless monopoles are transformed into an
equal number of nonabelian global gauge orientation and gauge-invariant
structure parameters characterizing the nonabelian cloud. We illustrate this
explicitly in a class of $Sp(2N)$ examples for which the full family of
monopole solutions is known. We show in detail how the unbroken symmetries of
the theory are manifested as isometries of the moduli space metric. We discuss
the connection of these results to the Montonen-Olive duality conjecture,
arguing in particular that the massless monopoles should be understood as the
duals to the massless gauge bosons that appear as the mediators of the
nonabelian forces in the perturbative sector.

Starting with a bare cutoff QED Hamiltonian, $H_{_{B}}$, with matrix elements
between free states of drastically different energies removed, we perform a
similarity transformation that removes the matrix elements between free states
with energy differences between the bare cutoff, $\Lambda$, and effective
cutoff, $\lam$ ($\lam < \Lam$). This generates effective interactions in the
renormalized Hamiltonian, $H_{_{R}}$. These effective interactions are derived
to order $\alpha$ in this work, with $\alpha \ll 1$. $H_{_{R}}$ is renormalized
by requiring it to satisfy coupling coherence. A nonrelativistic limit of the
theory is taken, and the resulting Hamiltonian is studied using bound-state
perturbation theory (BSPT). The effective cutoff, $\lam^2$, is fixed, and the
limit, $0 \longleftarrow m^2 \alpha^2\ll \lam^2 \ll m^2 \alpha \longrightarrow
\infty$, is taken. This upper bound on $\lam^2$ places the effects of
low-energy (energy transfer below $\lam$) emission in the effective
interactions in the $| e {\overline e} > $ sector. This lower bound on $\lam^2$
insures that the nonperturbative scale of interest is not removed by the
similarity transformation. As an explicit example of the general formalism
introduced, we show that the Hamiltonian renormalized to $O(\alpha)$ reproduces
the exact spectrum of spin splittings, with degeneracies dictated by rotational
symmetry, for the ground state through $O(\alpha^4)$. The entire calculation is
performed analytically, and gives the well known singlet-triplet ground state
spin splitting of positronium, $7/6 \alpha^2 Ryd$. We discuss remaining
corrections other than the spin splittings and how they can be treated in
calculating the spectrum with higher precision.

barrier, or to be reflected, by envisaging a physical clock which ticks only
when the particle is within the barrier region. The clock consists in a
magnetic moment initially aligned with the $x$ axis which in the barrier region
precesses around a constant magnetic field aligned with the $z$ axis, the
motion being in the $y$ direction. The values of the $x$ and $y$ components of
the magnetic moment beyond or in front of the barrier allow to assign a
tunneling or reflection time to every fraction of the packet which emerges from
the barrier and to calculate tunneling times $\tau_{\rm T,x}$ and $\tau_{\rm
T,y}$ and reflection times $\tau_{\rm R,x}$ and $\tau_{\rm R,y}$. The times
$\tau_{\rm T,x}$ and $\tau_{\rm T,y}$ ($\tau_{\rm R,x}$ and $\tau_{\rm R,y}$)
are remarkably equal, and independent of the initial position (in front of the
barrier) of the packet.
