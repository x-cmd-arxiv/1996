1.6$\times$10$^{-11}$photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Observations in 1993 confirmed
this level of emission. For observations made between December 1993 and April
1994, its intensity was a factor of 2.2$\pm$0.5 lower. Observations on 14 and
15 May, 1994 showed an increase over this quiescent level by a factor of

quality that they allow identification and analysis of diffuse Halpha emission
at surface brightness levels ranging from those of extremely low density HII
regions to those of the local Galactic disk diffuse emission. This paper
presents a study of the large scale distribution and global energetics of
diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in these galaxies and investigates the association
between DIG and discrete HII regions. Our results support the hypothesis that
the DIG is photoionized by Lyc photons which leak out of traditional HII
regions, and suggest that the local HI column density plays a role in
regulating the amount of leakage which can occur. This interpretation has
profound implications for the derivation of star-formation rates based on
Halpha emission--line fluxes since HII region counts alone will lead to
significant underestimates of the true rate. The contribution of the diffuse
Halpha component to the total Halpha emission, ie. the diffuse fraction, in
these galaxies is found to be similar to values found in other disk galaxies
with differing Hubble types and star formation rates. The constancy of the
diffuse fraction is rather unexpected and implies that the overall fraction of
photons which can leak out of HII regions and ionize the ISM over large scales
is relatively invariant from one galaxy to another.

The results are valid when the density fields are filtered with a top-hat

compared to the smoothing length. In particular I show that it is possible to
get the generating function of the coefficients C_{p,q} defined by <

well as the switching on and off of the instruments. We also find strong
evidence that one of the ME detectors was not working normally during the
second part of the March 1986 observation. When these effects are taken into
account, the CCF peaks are in all cases consistent with the absence of delays
between X-ray variations at different energies. This is unlike the results
found by several authors based on the same data. The power spectra of the 1-9
keV light curves are calculated and a detailed search for quasi periodic
oscillations (QPOs) carried out on these spectra by using a new technique for
the detection of periodic (or quasi-periodic) signals even in the presence of
source noise variability. No significant peaks are found above the 95%
confidence detection threshold, except during the second part of the March 1986

perturbations of black holes, and the question arises whether they are as
significant as normal modes are for self adjoint systems, such as harmonic
oscillators. They can be significant in two ways: Individual modes may dominate
the time evolution of some perturbation, and a whole set of them could be used
to completely describe this time evolution. It is known that quasinormal modes
of black holes have the first property, but not the second. It has recently
been suggested that a discontinuity in the underlying system would make the
corresponding set of quasinormal modes complete. We therefore turn the
Regge-Wheeler potential, which describes perturbations of Schwarzschild black
holes, into a series of step potentials, hoping to obtain a set of quasinormal
modes which shows both of the above properties. This hope proves to be futile,
though: The resulting set of modes appears to be complete, but it does not
contain any individual mode any more which is directly obvious in the time
evolution of initial data. Even worse: The quasinormal frequencies obtained in
this way seem to be extremely sensitive to very small changes in the underlying
potential. The question arises whether - and how - it is possible to make any
definite statements about the significance of quasinormal modes of black holes
at all, and whether it could be possible to obtain a set of quasinormal modes
with the desired properties in another way.

of polarization operator (generalized susceptibility), can be measured on a
finite interval and the high frequency asymptotics (up to a few orders) of

derive an equivalent form of the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relation, the
so-called sum rule, in which both the high-frequency part of Im $\Pi$ in the
dispersion integral and the high-order contribution to $\Pi$ are suppressed. We
provide a general framework for derivation of such sum rules, without any
recourse to an infinite-order differential operator. We derive sum rules for a
wide set of weight functions and show that any departure from the $e^{-t}$
behaviour of the weight function in sum rules leads to modulating factors on
the theoretical side of sum rules, providing its low frequency regularization.
We argue that by including modulating factors one can extend the domain of
validity of sum rules further to an intermediate region of frequencies and can
account for ``bumps"" which were observed numerically on the phenomenological
side of sum rules at ``intermediate'' frequencies.

Faddeev-Popov procedure using the covariant background field gauge-fixing
condition with background gauge field chosen to be a general critical point for
the action functional (i.e. a classical solution). The refinement takes into
account the gauge-fixing ambiguities coming from gauge transformations which
leave the critical point unchanged, resulting in the absence of infrared
divergences when the critical point is isolated modulo gauge transformations.
The procedure can be carried out using only the subgroup of gauge
transformations which are topologically trivial, possibly avoiding the usual
problems which arise due to gauge-fixing ambiguities. For Chern-Simons gauge
theory the method enables the partition function to be perturbatively expanded
for a number of simple spacetime manifolds such as $S^3$ and lens spaces, and

the appearance of a gauge freedom is naturally understood. The separation of
variables in operator formalism corresponds to a choice of gauge in path
integral, and the Green's function is shown to be gauge independent if the
operator ordering is properly taken into account. Unlike the conventional
Feynman path integral,which deals with a space-time picture of particle motion,
the path integral on the basis of the Jacobi's principle sums over orbits in
space. We illustrate these properties by evaluating an exact path integral of
the Green's function for the hydrogen atom in parabolic coordinates, and thus
avoiding the use of the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation. In the present
formulation , the Hamiltonian for Stark effect is converted to the one for
anharmonic oscillators with an unstable quartic coupling. We also study the
hydrogen atom path integral from a view point of one-dimensional quantum
gravity coupled to matter fields representing the electron coordinates. A
simple BRST analysis of the problem with an evaluation of Weyl anomaly is
presented .

$\mathbb L _{\kappa, \aleph_{0}}$ is categorical in a cardinal $\lambda >
\kappa$, and $\kappa$ is a measurable cardinal. There we prove that the class
of model of $T$ of cardinality $<\lambda$ (but $\geq |T|+\kappa$) has the
amalgamation property; this is a step toward understanding the character of
such classes of models.
  In this revised version we replaced the class of models of $T$ by $\mathfrak
k$, an AEC (abstract elementary class) which has LS-number ${<} \, \kappa,$ or
at least which behave nicely for ultrapowers by $D$, a normal ultra-filter on
$\kappa$.
  Presently sub-section \S1A deals with $T \subseteq \mathbb L_{\kappa^{+},
\aleph_{0}}$ (and so does a large part of the introduction and little in the
rest of \S1), but otherwise, all is done in the context of AEC.

luminosities exceeding $10^{38}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, resulting in large beam
power deposition into cryogenic liquid. Such targets must be able to absorb 500
watts or more with minimal change in target density. A 40~cm long liquid
hydrogen target, designed to absorb 500~watts of beam power without boiling,
has been developed for the SAMPLE experiment at Bates. In recent tests with
40~$\mu$A of incident beam, no evidence was seen for density fluctuations in
the target, at a sensitivity level of better than 1\%. A summary of the target
design and operational experience will be presented.

"q-alg/9602024","Lynelle Lang","Dmitry Fuchs, Lynelle Lang","Massey products and deformations","13 pages, tex document",,,,"q-alg math.QA",,"  The classical deformation theory of Lie algebras involves different kinds of
Massey products of cohomology classes. Even the condition of extendibility of
an infinitesimal deformation to a formal one-parameter deformation of a Lie
algebra involves Massey powers of two dimensional cohomology classes which are
not powers in the usual definition of Massey products in the cohomology of a
differential graded Lie algebra. In the case of deformations with other local
bases, one deals with other, more specific Massey products. In the present work
a construction of generalized Massey products is given, depending on an
arbitrary graded commutative, associative algebra. In terms of these products,
the above condition of extendibility is generalized to deformations with
arbitrary local bases. Dually, a construction of generalized Massey products on
the cohomology of a differential graded commutative associative algebra depends
on a nilpotent graded Lie algebra. For example, the classical Massey products
correspond to the Lie algebra of strictly upper triangular matrices, while the
matric Massey products correspond to the Lie algebra of block strictly upper
triangular matrices.
