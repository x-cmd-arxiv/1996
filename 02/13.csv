distribution in a gravitational well of a giant elliptical galaxy immersed in a
massive dark halo. The self-consistently determined gravitational potential of
the system provides the optical surface brightness distribution of the galaxy,
matching the de Vaucouleurs R^1/4-law, if the sound speed in the gas, stellar
velocity dispersion, and velocity dispersion of dark matter are related so that
optical and X-ray brightness profiles match each other.
  The thermal equilibrium of the gas is described in the framework of a
one-zone model, which incorporates radiative cooling, stellar mass loss,
supernova heating, and mass sink due to local condensational instability. The
sequence of saddle-node and saddle-connection bifurcations provides a
first-order phase transition, which separates the stable hot phase in the
cooling medium for a reasonably high efficiency of condensation and precludes
catastrophic cooling of the gas. The bifurcations occur naturally, due to the
shape of the radiative cooling function, and this holds for a wide range of gas
metallicities. The one-zone model implies a scaling relation for the
equilibrium stellar and gas densities, which allows a hydrostatic, thermally
stable distribution for the hot isothermal coronal gas. The resulting model for
gas recycling reproduces the basic optical and X-ray properties of relatively
isolated giant elliptical galaxies with hot haloes. Implications for cD
galaxies in X-ray dominant clusters and groups are briefly discussed in the
general context of galaxy formation and evolution.

X-ray background. The halo should also generate temperature anisotropies in the
microwave background via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. Assuming an isothermal
spherical halo with the above temperature and density, the amplitude of the
induced quadrupole turns out to be comparable to the COBE data without
violating the upper limit on the $y$-parameter. The induced dipole is
negligible compared to the peculiar velocity of the Local Group, and multipoles
higher than quadrupole are generally much smaller than the observed ones.
However non-sphericity and/or clumpiness of the halo will produce a stronger
effect. Therefore the gaseous halo of the Local Group, if it exists, will
affect the estimate of the primordial spectral index $n$ and the amplitude of
the density fluctuations deduced from the {\sl COBE} data.

the lack of inversion center in the crystal, as well as the linear terms which

  arithmetic",,"Archive for Mathematical Logic 37 (1998) 343-362",,"Logic E-prints February 13, 1996","math.LO",,"  We study properties of complete separable metric spaces within the framework
of subsystems of second order arithmetic. In particular we consider Lebesgue
and Atsuji spaces. The former are those such that every open covering U has a
Lebesgue number, i.e. a positive number q such that for every point x of the
space, there exists an element of U which contains the ball of center x and
radius q; the latter are those such that every continuous function into another
complete separable metric space is uniformly continuous.
  The main results we obtain are the following: the statement ""every compact
space is Lebesgue"" is equivalent to WKL_0; the statements ""every perfect
Lebesgue space is compact"" and ""every perfect Atsuji space is compact"" are
equivalent to ACA_0; the statement ""every Lebesgue space is Atsuji"" is provable
in RCA_0; the statement ""every Atsuji space is Lebesgue"" is provable in ACA_0,
but we do not know if it is equivalent to ACA_0. We also prove that the
statement ""the distance from a closed set is a continuous function"" is
equivalent to Pi^1_1-CA_0; the statements ""there exists a complete separable
metric space which is perfect and Heine-Borel compact (resp. Lebesgue, Atsuji)""
are all equivalent to WKL_0.

  groups",,,,"MSRI 1996-012","math.RT",,"  This paper is concerned with representations of split orthogonal and
quasi-split unitary groups over a nonarchimedean local field which are not
generic, but which support a unique model of a different kind, the generalized
Bessel model. The properties of the Bessel models under induction are studied,
and an analogue of Rodier's theorem concerning the induction of Whittaker
models is proved for Bessel models which are minimal in a suitable sense. The
holomorphicity in the induction parameter of the Bessel functional is
established. Last, local coefficients are defined for each irreducible
supercuspidal representation which carries a Bessel functional and also for a
certain component of each representation parabolically induced from such a
supercuspidal.

compared to the uncertainties associated at present with the usual equilibrium
values. The quantitative estimates are obtained in situations characterized by
a stationary planar shear flow of realistic magnitude, or by a stationary

transition is studied. The Ginzburg-Landau formalism is extended by the
inclusion of an extra term in the free energy that depends on the vertical
displacements from a flat surface. The probability that a bin has a particular
net displacement is determined by lattice simulation, where the physics input
is color confinement. The surface fluctuation from bin to bin is related to
multiplicity fluctuation, which in turn is measured by the factorial moments.
It is found that both the F-scaling behavior and the scaling exponent are
essentially unaffected by the inclusion of surface fluctuation.

reactions on $^{56}$Fe and $^{27}$Al have been analyzed by the Quantum
Molecular Dynamics (QMD) plus Statistical Decay Model (SDM). It was found that
the mass and charge distributions calculated with and without the statistical
decay have very different shapes. These results also depend strongly on the
impact parameter, showing an importance of the dynamical treatment as realized
by the QMD approach. The calculated results were compared with experimental
data in the energy region from 50 MeV to 5 GeV. The QMD+SDM calculation could
reproduce the production cross sections of the light clusters and
intermediate-mass to heavy fragments in a good accuracy. The production cross
section of $^{7}$Be was, however, underpredicted by approximately 2 orders of
magnitude, showing the necessity of another reaction mechanism not taken into
account in the present model.

gaps and single particle energies with the model--space
Brueckner--Hartree--Fock (MBHF) method, without double counting of
two--particle correlations. Neutron energy gaps are calculated at zero and
finite temperature. Proton energy gaps are calculated at beta equilibrium, and
it is shown that the inclusion of muons has a significant effect. The results
are compared with those of other works, and the implications for neutron star
physics are briefly discussed.

domains of different densities are separated by sharp interfaces. Complex
interfacial pattern formation may occur through the competition of short- and
long-range forces acting within the monolayer. The overdamped hydrodynamics of
such interfacial motion is treated here in a general manner that accounts for
dissipation both within the monolayer and in the subfluid. Previous results on
the linear stability of interfaces are recovered and extended, and a
formulation applicable to the nonlinear regime is developed. A simplified
dynamical law valid when dissipation in the monolayer itself is negligible is
also proposed. Throughout the analysis, special attention is paid to the
dependence of the dynamical behavior on a characteristic length scale set by
the ratio of the viscosities in the monolayer and in the subphase.
