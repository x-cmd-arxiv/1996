  ApJ",,"10.1086/177536",,"astro-ph",,"  We have developed a method for calculating the two-point correlation function
of nonlinearly evolved mass and collapsed halos in the Press-Schechter
formalism. The nonlinear gravitational interaction is treated as the sum of
various individual spherical top-hat clustering. Because no collapsed halo of
mass M can exist in initial regions (or top-hat spheres) of mass less than M,
the bias that massive halos have stronger correlation than the background mass
can be naturally introduced. We apply this method to derive constraints on
popular dark-matter models from the spatial number density and the correlation
function of C IV absorption systems in QSO spectra. Considering C IV systems
should behosted by collapsed halos, one can obtain an upper limit to the
threshold mass of the collapsed halos by requiring their number density to be
larger than that of observed C IV systems. On the other hand, in order to
explain the observed clustering of C IV systems, a lower limit to the threshold
mass will be set for the hosting halos. The cold dark matter model, the Lamda
CDM model and the cold-plus-hot dark matter model are tested using the C IV
observations.

the nearby Wolf-Rayet galaxy NGC 1741. The spatial morphology from the Faint
Object Camera image is dominated by two main starburst centers, each being
about 100 times as luminous as 30 Doradus. Both starburst centers are composed
of several intense knots of recent star formation. A Goddard High Resolution
Spectrograph spectrum of a portion of the southern starburst center is
consistent with a population of young stars following a Salpeter IMF for masses
above approx 15 Msun (lower mass stars may also be present), and extending up
to approx 100 Msun; about 10^4 O-type stars are inferred from the UV
luminosity. Numerous strong interstellar lines are detected. Although not
resolved, their strength suggests that they are formed in individual bubbles
and shells with velocities up to a few hundred kms. The red wing of the
Lyman-alpha absorption profile indicates the presence of several neutral
hydrogen components, one in our own Galaxy and the others at or close to the
distance of NGC 1741. Overall, the stellar and interstellar line spectrum, as
well as the continuum shape of NGC 1741, strongly resembles star-forming
galaxies recently discovered at high redshift.

and spheroidal components of galaxies. Elaborating on the hierarchical
clustering scheme of galaxy formation proposed by Cole et al., we assume that
galaxies form stars quiescently in a disk until they are disrupted into a
spheroidal configuration by mergers. We calculate formation and merging
histories, and the evolution in colour, luminosity and morphology of the galaxy
populations in different environments. Roughly $ 50\ %$ of ellipticals in our
model have undergone a major merger since $z = 0.5$, yet in spite of this we
find that cluster ellipticals have colour-magnitude diagrams with remarkably
small scatter. The morphological mix of galaxies that become rich cluster
members at high redshift is dominated by spiral galaxies, due to the long
timescale for galaxy mergers compared with the timescale for cluster assembly
at high redshift. The assembly of low redshift clusters is slower, allowing
more galaxy mergers to occur in the progenitor halos. As a result $z=0$ rich
clusters become E/S0 dominated and we find a ``Butcher-Oemler'' effect that
becomes weaker for poorer groups at high redshift. The field luminosity
function of red galaxies shows little evolution out to $z\simeq 1$ and the
reddest galaxies at these redshifts are as bright as their local counterparts.
The blue luminosity function, on the other hand, evolves rapidly with redshift,
increasing its characteristic luminosity and becoming steeper at the faint end.
These trends are similar to those recently observed in the Canada-France
Redshift Survey.

the reaction force of the Magnus force, and that the two forces act on
different objects. Therefore one can conclude that the evaluation of the
spepctral flow confirms the results by the Berry's phase calculation of the
Magnus force, not the cancelation of the Magnus force as claimed by some

exhibits basic features of the experimental spectrum while nonlinear dynamics

counterterm and the anomaly decompose into a parity even and a parity odd part.
