star formation. We present CO(1-0) interferometer data of the bar and
circumnuclear region with 2.3 x 2.2 arcsec spatial resolution and 13 km/s
velocity resolution acquired at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory . These data
reveal a clumpy circumnuclear ring of molecular gas. We also find a peak of CO
inside the ring within 2 arcsec of the optical center that is not associated
with massive star formation. We construct a rotation curve from these CO
kinematic data and the mass model of Combes et al. (1992). Using this rotation
curve, we have identified the location of orbital resonances in the galaxy.
Assuming that the bar ends at corotation, the circumnuclear ring of star
formation lies between two Inner Lindblad Resonances, while the nuclear stellar
bar ends near the IILR. Deviations from circular motion are detected just
beyond the CO and H-alpha ring, where the dust lanes along the leading edge of
the bar intersect the nuclear ring. These non-circular motions along the minor
axis correspond to radially inward streaming motions at speeds of 20 - 90 km/s
and clearly show inflowing gas feeding an ILR ring. There are bright HII
regions near the ends of this inflow region, perhaps indicating triggering of
star formation by the inflow.

band (20-120 keV) for approximately 1400 days using the BATSE instrument on
board the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. Globular clusters may contain a large
number of compact objects (e.g., pulsars or X-ray binaries containing neutron
stars) which can produce hard X-ray emission. Our search provides a sensitive
(~50 mCrab) monitor for hard X-ray transient events on time scales of >1 day
and a means for observing persistent hard X-ray emission. We have discovered no
transient events from any of the clusters and no persistent emission. Our
observations include a sensitive search of four nearby clusters containing dim
X-ray sources: 47 Tucanae, NGC 5139, NGC 6397, and NGC 6752. The non-detection
in these clusters implies a lower limit for the recurrence time of transients
of 2 to 6 years for events with luminosities >10^36 erg s^-1 (20-120 keV) and
~20 years if the sources in these clusters are taken collectively. This
suggests that the dim X-ray sources in these clusters are not transients
similar to Aql~X-1. We also place upper limits on the persistent emission in
the range 2-10*10^34 erg s^-1 (2 sigma, 20-120 keV) for these four clusters.
For 47 Tuc the upper limit is more sensitive than previous measurements by a
factor of 3. We find a model dependent upper limit of 19 isolated millisecond
pulsars (MSPs) producing gamma-rays in 47 Tuc, compared to the 11 observed
radio MSPs in this cluster.

The magnetic field decay of a pulsar may
be able to give us an answer. Since Cooper pairing of quarks occurs inside a
sufficiently cold strange star, the strange stellar core is superconducting. In
order to compensate the effect of rotation, different superconducting species
inside a rotating strange star try to set up different values of London fields.
Thus, we have a frustrated system. Using Ginzburg-Landau formalism, I solved
the problem of rotating a superconducting strange star: Instead of setting up a
global London field, vortex bundles carrying localized magnetic fields are
formed. Moreover, the number density of vortex bundles is directly proportional
to the angular speed of the star. Since it is energetically favorable for the
vortex bundles to pin to magnetic flux tubes, the rotational dynamics and
magnetic evolution of a strange star are coupled together, leading to the
magnetic flux expulsion as the star slows down. I investigate this effect
numerically and find that the characteristic field decay time is much less than
20~Myr in all reasonable parameter region. On the other hand, the
characteristic magnetic field decay time for pulsars is $\geq 20$~Myr. Thus, my
finding cast doubt on the hypothesis that pulsars are strange stars.

what the continuum picture might suggest. Indeed, the fundamental excitations
of quantum geometry are 1-dimensional, rather like polymers, and the
3-dimensional continuum geometry emerges only on coarse graining. The full
Hilbert space admits an orthonormal decomposition into finite dimensional
sub-spaces which can be interpreted as the spaces of states of spin systems.
Using this property, the complete spectrum of the area operators is evaluated.

discuss 3-dimensional geometric operators, e.g., the ones corresponding to
volumes of regions.
