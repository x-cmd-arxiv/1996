of clusters for the velocity structure of galaxies in the core. Strong and weak
lensing data are used to construct the total mass profile of the cluster, which
is used in conjunction with the optical galaxy data to solve in detail for the
nature of galaxy orbits and the velocity anisotropy in the central regions. We
also examine other observationally and physically motivated mass models,
specifically those obtained from X-ray observations and N-body simulations. The
aim of this analysis is to understand qualitatively the structure of the core
and test some of the key assumptions of the standard picture of cluster
formation regarding relaxation, virialization and equilibrium. This technique
is applied to the cluster Abell 2218, where we find evidence for an anisotropic
core, which we interpret to indicate the existence of a dynamically disturbed
central region. We find that the requirement of physically meaningful solutions
for the velocity anisotropy places stringent bounds on the slope of cluster
density profiles in the inner regions.

recently detected behind the foreground clusters of galaxies on scale of $10$
arcminutes, we have investigated the possibility of attributing the
quasar-cluster associations to gravitational lensing by large-scale matter
inhomogeneities. Based on the conventional lensing models, we have shown that
the reported quasar overdensity is unlikely to be generated by cluster matter
alone. The situation does not change even if all the clusters of galaxies which
follow their spatial two-point correlation function are taken into account,
while matter clumps on scale of $>20$ Mpc are also found to be unable to
provide the required mass surface density since their density contrast is
strictly limited by the anisotropy measurements of the cosmic background
radiation. Moreover, we have pointed out that the influence of a nonzero
cosmological constant on the quasar-cluster associations is very minor. We
conclude that either the observed quasar number counts have been seriously
contaminated by the magnification bias of matter inhomogeneities of the
universe or there should exists some intercluster matter on scale of less than
$\sim20$ Mpc, e.g. from cluster-galaxy correlation, whose mean cosmic density
is about an order of magnitude higher than that of clusters of galaxies.

inertial frame defined by the lenses from that defined by the CMB dipole and
estimate the Hubble constant. The residual proper motions after subtracting the

to estimate the density parameter $\Omega_0$. For $N$ lenses, VLBI measurement
accuracies of $\sigma_\theta$, and a baseline of $T$ years, we estimate that
the 2$\sigma$ limit on the rms peculiar velocity of the lens galaxies is $3100

$\frac{p_i}{q}$ close enough to $\frac{1}{2}$, we find that in the ground state

instability where the usual arguments predict a period-$q$ state that produces
a gap at the Fermi level and is insulating. However for $\frac{p_i}{q}$ far
enough from $\frac{1}{2}$, this phase becomes unstable against phase
separation. The ground state is a mixture of a period-$q$ ionic configuration
and an empty (or full) configuration, where both configurations have the same
electron density to leading order. Combining these new results with those
previously obtained for strong coupling, it follows that a phase transition
occurs in the ground state, as a function of the coupling, for ion densities

($R^4,\,SO(1,3),\dots$) symmetries and stress the fundamental importance of the
corresponding conserved currents. In Sec.\ 3, experimental results with neutron
interferometers in the gravitational field of the earth, as inter- preted by
means of the equivalence principle, can be predicted by means of the Dirac
equation in an accelerated and rotating reference frame. Using the Dirac
equation in such a non-inertial frame, we describe how in a gauge- theoretical
approach (see Table 1) the Einstein-Cartan theory, residing in a Riemann-Cartan
spacetime encompassing torsion and curvature, arises as the simplest
gravitational theory. This is set in contrast to the Einsteinian approach
yielding general relativity in a Riemannian spacetime. In Secs.\ 4 and 5 we
consider the conserved energy-momentum current of matter and gauge the
associated translation subgroup. The Einsteinian teleparallelism theory which
emerges is shown to be equivalent, for spinless matter and for
electromagnetism, to general relativity. Having successfully gauged the
translations, it is straightforward to gauge the four-dimensional affine group
$R^4 \semidirect GL(4,R)$ or its Poincar\'e subgroup $R^4\semidirect SO(1,3)$.
We briefly report on these results in Sec.\ 6 (metric-affine geometry) and in
Sec.\ 7 (metric-affine field equations (\ref{zeroth}, \ref{first},

discussion, which bring life into the metric-affine gauge framework developed.

bound states of two gluinos. It is shown that existing and future colliders
imply a realistic chance of observing gluinonium as a narrow peak in the
two-jet invariant mass spectrum. With an integrated luminosity of 0.2 fb$^{-1}$
at the Tevatron, and the high efficiency for tagging heavy quark jets at CDF,
one should be able to detect vector gluinonium for gluino masses up to about
170 GeV; or up to about 260 GeV for an upgraded Tevatron with a centre of mass
energy of 2 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 1 fb$^{-1}$. The significantly
higher energy and luminosity of LHC should allow pseudoscalar gluinonium to be
detected for gluino masses up to about 1500 GeV for an assumed luminosity of
200 fb$^{-1}$. These results are insensitive to the details of supersymmetry
models, provided that R-parity is conserved and the gluinos are lighter than
the squarks. In addition, gluinonium detection implies a relatively accurate
measure of the gluino mass, which is difficult to determine by other means.

the flavor symmetric case in the nucleon ($\bar u -\bar d$=0). Second, it is
indicated that valence-quark shadowing could be used for discriminating among
various shadowing models. Third, we find that nuclear dependence of $Q^2$
evolution $\partial [F_2^{Sn}/F_2^C]/ \partial [\ln Q^2]$, which was found by
NMC, is essentially understood by modification of parton distributions in
nuclei. However, higher-twist effects in nuclear interactions could be tested
by studying the details of the nuclear $Q^2$ evolution.

is shown that in a stationary 2+1 dimensional spacetime, the eigenvectors of
the covariant derivative of the timelike Killing vector form a rigid structure,
the {\it principal Killing triad}. Two of the triad vectors are null, and in
many respects they play the role similar to the principal null directions in
the algebraically special 4-D spacetimes. It is demonstrated that the principal
Killing triad can be efficiently used for classification and study of
stationary 2+1 spacetimes.
  One of the most interesting applications is a study of minimal surfaces in a
stationary spacetime. A {\it principal Killing surface} is defined as a surface
formed by Killing trajectories passing through a null ray, which is tangent to
one of the null vectors of the principal Killing triad. We prove that a
principal Killing surface is minimal if and only if the corresponding null
vector is geodesic. Furthermore, we prove that if the 2+1 dimensional spacetime
contains a static limit, then the only regular stationary timelike minimal
2-surfaces that cross the static limit, are the minimal principal Killing
surfaces.
  A timelike minimal surface is a solution to the Nambu-Goto equations of
motion and hence it describes a cosmic string configuration. A stationary
string interacting with a 2+1 dimensional rotating black hole is discussed in
detail.

at 1350 K and at the three compositions x=0.33, 0.42 and 0.65. The calculations
are based on density-functional theory in the local density approximation and
on the pseudopotential plane-wave method. The reliability of the simulations is
confirmed by detailed comparisons with very recent neutron diffraction results
for the partial structure factors and radial distribution functions (RDF) of
the stoichiometric liquid Ag2Se. The simulations show a dramatic change of the
Se-Se RDF with increasing Se content. This change is due to the formation of Se
clusters bound by covalent bonds, the Se-Se bond length being almost the same
as in pure c-Se and l-Se. The clusters are predominantly chain-like, but for
higher x a large fraction of 3-fold coordinated Se atoms is also found. It is
shown that the equilibrium fractions of Se present as isolated atoms and in
clusters can be understood on a simple charge-balance model based on an ionic
interpretation. The Ag and Se diffusion coefficients both increase with Se
content, in spite of the Se clustering. An analysis of the Se-Se bond dynamics
reveals surprisingly short bond lifetimes of less than 1 ps. The changes in the
density of states with composition arise directly from the formation of Se-Se
covalent bonds. Results for the electronic conductivity obtained using the
Kubo-Greenwood approximation are in adequate agreement with experiment for
l-Ag2Se, but not for the high Se contents. Possible reasons for this are
discussed.
