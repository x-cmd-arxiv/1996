in relation to the distribution of stars near the red giant branch (RGB) tip
for the globular clusters M22, M5, M68, M107, M72, M92, M3 and 47 Tuc. This new
method permits determination of the cluster ages to greater accuracy than
conventional isochrone fitting. Using the method in conjunction with our new
high-quality photometric data for RGB and HB stars in the first five of these
clusters, we discuss the origins of the spread in color on the HB and its
relation to the `second parameter' problem. The oldest clusters in our sample
are found to have relatively low ages ($13.5 \pm 2$ Gyr).
  A 1$\sigma$ uncertainty in each of the parameters of mass and helium content
combined with the effects of helium diffusion gives a lower limit for the age
of the oldest clusters of 9.7 Gyr.

and gas pressure dominated accretion disks. We find that in addition to radial
drift driven by turbulent diffusion and biased by the global field geometry,
there are buoyancy effects which tend to move magnetic flux outward. In gas
pressure dominated disks the poloidal magnetic field will move outward at a
rate comparable to its inward advection. On the other hand, in a radiation
pressure dominated disk the poloidal magnetic field will usually move outward
faster than it is advected inward. This implies that the fields in disks in
active galactic nuclei are generated at small radii by an internal disk dynamo.
This conclusion can be avoided if the external field imposes a supersonic
Alfv\'en speed within the disk without giving rise to interchange
instabilities. In any case we note that variations in the mass transfer rate
will lead directly to a modulation of the nonthermal emission from the disk
system.

  Moriond Meeting ""Clustering in the Universe"", Les Arcs, 1995",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Since the appearance of the classical paper of Lifshitz almost half a century
ago, linear stability analysis of cosmological models is textbook knowledge.
Until recently, however, little was known about the behavior of higher than
linear order terms in the perturbative expansion. These terms become important
in the weakly nonlinear regime of gravitational clustering, when the rms mass
density contrast is only slightly smaller than unity. In the past, theorists
showed little interest in studying this regime, and for a good reason: only a
decade ago, it would have been an academic excercise - at scales large enough
to probe the weakly nonlinear regime, all measures of clustering were dominated
by noise. This is no longer the case with present data. The purpose of this
talk is to provide a brief summary of recent advances in weakly nonlinear
perturbation theory. We present analytical perturbative results together with
results of N-body experiments, conducted to test their accuracy. We compare
perturbative predictions with measurements from galaxy surveys. Such
comparisons can be used to test the gravitational instability theory and to
constrain possible deviations from Gaussian statistics in the initial mass
distribution; they can be also used to study the nature of physical processes
that govern galaxy formation (``biasing''). We also show how future studies of
velocity field statistics can provide a new way to determine the density
parameter, $\Omega$.

considers the ADM mass equal to the central charge as a function of electric

space (a minimum corresponds to a fixed point of attraction). The extremal
value of the square of the central charge provides the area of the horizon,
which depends only on electric and magnetic charges. The doubling of unbroken
supersymmetry at the fixed point of attraction for N=2 black holes near the
horizon is derived via conformal flatness of the Bertotti-Robinson-type

the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of N=2 black holes which is
