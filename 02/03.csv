sources, etc., one expects both relativistic and transrelativistic shocks
acompanied by violent motions of moderately relativistic plasma. We present
general considerations indicating that these sites are electron and positron
accelerators leading to a modified power law spectrum. The electron (or
$e^\pm$) energy index is very hard, $\propto \gamma^{-1}$ or flatter up to a
comoving frame break energy $\gamma_\ast$, and becomes steeper above that. In
the example of gamma-ray bursts the Lorentz factor reaches $\gamma_\ast\sim
10^3$ for $e^{\pm}$ accelerated by the internal shock ensemble on
subhydrodynamical time scales. For pairs accelerated on hydrodynamical
timescales in the external shocks similarly hard spectra are obtained, and the
break Lorentz factor can be as high as $\gamma_\star \siml 10^5$. Radiation
from the nonthermal electrons produces photon spectra with shape and
characteristic energies in qualitative agreement with observed generic
gamma-ray burst and blazar spectra. The scenario described here provides a
plausible way to solve one of the crucial problems of nonthermal high energy

the explosion mechanism, the optical and infrared light curves (LC), and the
spectral evolution. This leaves the description of the burning front and the
structure of the white dwarf as the only free parameters. The explosions are
calculated using one-dimensional Lagrangian codes including nuclear networks.
Subsequently, optical and IR-LCs are constructed. Detailed NLTE-spectra are
computed for several instants of time using the density, chemical and
luminosity structure resulting from the LCs. The general methods and critical
tests are presented (sect. 2).
  Different models for the thermonuclear explosion are discussed including
detonations, deflagrations, delayed detonations, pulsating delayed detonations
(PDD) and helium detonations (sect.3). Comparisons between theoretical and
observed LCs and spectra provide an insight into details of the explosion and
nature of the progenitor stars (sect. 4/5). We try to answer several related
questions. Are subluminous SNe Ia a group different from `normal' SN Ia (sect.
5)? Can we understand observed properties of the LCs and spectra (sect. 4)?
What do we learn about the progenitor evolution and its metallicity (sect. 3,
Figs. 4,5)? Do successful SN~Ia models depend on the type of the host galaxy
(Table 2)? Using both the spectral and LC information, theoretical models allow
for a determination of the Hubble constant independent from `local' distance

considered. The meaning of the polynomial relations from the point of view of
quantum mechanics on a sphere are discussed.

c d})$ which describes the on-shell theory, a spinor superfield $(J_\a )$ can
be introduced into the 11D geometrical tensors with engineering dimensions less
or equal to one in such a way to satisfy the Bianchi identities in superspace.
The components arising from $J_\a$ are identified as some of the auxiliary
fields required for a full off-shell formulation. Our result indicates that
eleven dimensional supergravity does not have to be completely on-shell. The
$\k\-$symmetry of the supermembrane action in the presence of our partial
off-shell supergravity background is also confirmed. Our modifications to
eleven-dimensional supergravity theory are thus likely relevant for M-theory.
We suggest our proposal as a significant systematic off-shell generalization of
eleven-dimensional supergravity theory.
