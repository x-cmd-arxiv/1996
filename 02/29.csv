function does not exhibit a tail of high velocity clusters. The results
indicate a low probability of $\lesssim$\,5\% of finding clusters with
one-dimensional velocities greater than $\sim$ 600 {\kms}. The root-mean-square
one-dimensional cluster velocity is 293$\pm$28 {\kms}. The observed cluster
velocity function is compared with expectations from different cosmological

consistent with a low mass-density ($\Omega \sim$0.3) CDM model, and is

$\tau_p$ is approximated from the oscillations of the time series. The
procedure is assessed using the correlation dimension for both synthetic and

always give good results given enough data and thus $\tau_p$ can be considered
as a lower limit ($\tau_w \geq \tau_p$). For noisy synthetic data and real

given that the bond contributions are negligible in the long wavelength limit.
We analyse the system with two non-overlapping bands in this limit, and show
that the corresponding dielectric matrix reduces to a $2\times2$ form. The
intra-band and inter-band contributions are represented by diagonal matrix
elements, while the off-diagonal elements contain the mixing between them. The
latter is absent in insulators but may be finite in conductors. Performing the
multipole expansion of the bare long-range interaction, we show that this
mixing is directly related to the symmetry of the atomic orbitals participating
in the tight-binding electronic states. In systems with forbidden atomic
dipolar transitions, the intra-band and inter-band polarizations are separated.
However, when the dipolar transitions are allowed, the off-diagonal elements of
the dielectric matrix are of the same order as diagonal ones, due to a finite
monopole-dipole interaction between the intra-band and inter-band charge
fluctuations.

potential $V_{q\bar q}$ in QCD in terms of a Wilson Loop $W(\Gamma)$ determined
by pure Yang Mills theory. We use an effective dual theory of long-distance
Yang Mills theory to calculate $W(\Gamma)$ for large loops; i.e. for loops of
size $R > R_{FT}$. ($R_{FT}$ is the flux tube radius, fixed by the value of the
Higgs (monopole) mass of the dual theory, which is a concrete realization of
the Mandelstam 't Hooft dual superconductor mechanism of confinement).
  We replace $W(\Gamma)$ by $W_{eff}(\Gamma)$, given by a functional integral
over the dual variables, which for $R > R_{FT}$ can be evaluated by a
semiclassical expansion, since the dual theory is weakly coupled at these
distances. The classical approximation gives the leading contribution to
$W_{eff}(\Gamma)$ and yields a velocity dependent heavy quark potential which
for large $R$ becomes linear in $R$, and which for small $R$ approaches lowest
order perturbative QCD. This latter fact means that these results should remain
applicable down to distances where radiative corrections giving rise to a
running coupling constant become important. The spin dependence of the
potential reflects the vector coupling of the quarks at long range as well as
at short range. The methods developed here should be applicable to any
realization of the dual superconductor mechanism. They give an expression
determining $W_{eff}(\Gamma)$ independent of the classical approximation, but
semi classical corrections due to fluctuations of the flux tube are not worked
out in this paper. Taking these into account should lead to an effective string
theory free from the conformal anomaly.

radiative breaking of the electro-weak symmetry in the supersymmetric standard
model due to the large top-quark Yukawa coupling. Such large Yukawa couplings
occur for a large class of string models. The Z' and exotic masses are either
of O(M_Z), or of a scale intermediate between the string and electro-weak

fine tuning, and is within future experimental reach. (This paper is a summary,

directly applied to correct errors due to quantum entanglement. We specify
general criteria for quantum error correction, introduce quantum versions of
the Hamming and the Gilbert-Varshamov bounds and comment on the practical
implementation of quantum codes.
