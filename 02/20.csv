mapping of the local velocity field of the universe, study of the formation and
evolution of galaxies, and determining the global cosmological parameters
$H_0$, $q_0$ and $\Lambda$ through the application of classical cosmological
tests like source counts. Particularly emphasized is the redshift survey
capability of the SKA. A review is given of the current knowledge of the galaxy
distribution, starting from an inventarisation of nearby cosmic structures,
through a discussion of how it all fits together in a coherent ``foamlike

structure formation, a description is provided of different observational
strategies to probe the structure of the universe out to larger depths, ranging
from pencil-beam surveys and cluster surveys out to the new and ambitious
complete and deep galaxy redshift surveys like the 2dF and the Sloan survey. It
is argued that a survey with the SKA would be a natural and complementary

requirements for the SKA to make it into an instrument ideally suited for these

with a view towards characterizing the field configurations employed as initial
conditions for numerical simulations of the formation of disoriented chiral
condensates in high-energy nuclear collisions. The field is decomposed into its
spatial average (the order parameter) and the fluctuations (the quasi-
particles) and enclosed in a rectangular box with periodic boundary conditions.
The quantized quasi-particle modes are described approximately by Klein-Gordon
dispersion relations containing an effective mass that depends on both the
temperature and the magnitude of the order parameter. The thermal fluctuations
are instrumental in shaping the effective potential governing the order
parameter, and the evolution of its statistical distribution with temperature
is discussed, as is the behavior of the associated effective masses. As the
system is cooled the field fluctuations subside, causing a smooth change from
the high-temperature phase in which chiral symmetry is approximately restored
towards the normal phase. Of practical interest is the fact that the
equilibrium field configurations can be sampled in a simple manner, thus
providing a convenient means for specifying the initial conditions in dynamical
simulations of the non-equilibrium relaxation of the chiral field. The
corresponding correlation function is briefly considered and used to calculate
the spectral strength of radiated pions. Finally, by propagating samples of
initial configurations by the exact equation of motion, it has been ascertained
that the treatment is sufficiently accurate to be of practical utility.

propose a minimal extension of the supersymmetric standard model in which
R-parity conservation arises naturally in this way. This approach predicts the
existence of a very weakly coupled, neutral chiral supermultiplet of particles
with electroweak-scale masses and lifetimes which may be cosmologically
interesting. Neutrino masses arise via an intermediate-scale seesaw mechanism,
and a solution to the $\mu$ problem is naturally incorporated. The apparent
unification of gauge couplings at high energies is shown to be preserved in
this approach. We also discuss a next-to-minimal extension, which predicts a

implies a conical singularity at the horizon and modifies the gravitational
action by terms defined on the horizon. A consistent variational procedure for
the action functional is formulated. It is shown that the free energy reaches
an extremum on the regular manifold with $T=T_H$. The one-loop contribution to
the action in the Liouville-Polyakov form is re-examined. All the boundary
terms are taken into account and the dependence on the state of the quantum

product sets can be written as unions of subsets, each of which is ""narrow"" in

subset in a small set. For example, if the set (omega \times omega) is
partitioned into two pieces along the diagonal, then one piece meets every
horizontal line in a finite set, and the other piece meets each vertical line
in a finite set. Such partitions or coverings can exist only when the sets
forming the product are of limited size.
  This paper considers such coverings for products of infinitely many sets
(usually a product of omega copies of the same cardinal kappa). In this case, a
covering of the product by narrow sets, one for each coordinate direction, will
exist no matter how large the factor sets are. But if one restricts the sets
used in the covering (for instance, requiring them to be Borel in a product
topology), then the existence of narrow coverings is related to a number of
large cardinal properties: partition cardinals, the free subset problem,
nonregular ultrafilters, and so on.

and quantum error correction. Although some of these ideas are still beyond the
grasp of current technology, quantum cryptography has been implemented and the
prospects are encouraging for small-scale prototypes of quantum computation
devices before the end of the millennium.

considered. Analytical properties of the scattering amplitudes have been
investigated by means of the integral equations equivalent to the Schrodinger
equations. The transition and reflection amplitudes are expressed in terms of
two complex functions of the incident energy, which are similar to the Jost
function in the partial-wave scattering. These functions are entire for
finite-range potentials and meromorphic for exponentially decreasing
potentials. The analytical properties result from locality of the potential in
the wave equation and represent the effect of causality in time dependence of
the scattering process.
