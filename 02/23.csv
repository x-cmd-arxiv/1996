the supernova remnant SN1006 has recently been interpreted as synchrotron
radiation of electrons with energies around 100 TeV. In this letter we
calculate the flux of inverse Compton emission at TeV photon energies that is a
natural consequence of the existence of such high energy electrons and the
cosmic microwave background. We find that the predicted flux is near the
present sensitivity limit of the southern \v Cerenkov telescope CANGAROO, and
should be detectable with the next performance improvements. The spectrum of
SN1006 at a few TeV will be very soft. The existence of such highest energy
electrons in SN1006 may not be a unique to this remnant. We can therefore
conclude that the detection of TeV $\gamma$-ray emission in any supernova
remnant does not necessarily provide evidence for a large number of cosmic ray
nucleons in these objects, and thus is no simple test of cosmic ray origin as
far as nucleons are concerned.

early-type galaxies observed with the Planetary Camera of the Hubble Space
Telescope. These parameters are based on a new empirical law that successfully
characterizes the centers of early type galaxies. This empirical law assumes
that the surface brightness profile is a combination of two power laws with
different slopes gamma and beta for the inner and outer regions. Conventional
structural parameters such as core radius and central surface brightness are
replaced by break radius r_b, where the transition between power-law slopes
takes place, and surface brightness mu_b at that radius. An additional
parameter alpha describes the sharpness of the break. The structural parameters
are derived using a chi-squared minimization process applied to the mean
surface brightness profiles. The resulting model profiles generally give very
good agreement to the observed profiles out to the radius of 10 arcseconds
imaged by the Planetary Camera. Exceptions include galaxies which depart from
pure power-laws at large radius, those with strong nuclear components, and
galaxies partly obscured by dust. The uncertainties in the derived parameters
are estimated using Monte-Carlo simulations which test the stability of
solutions in the face of photon noise and the effects of the deconvolution
process. The covariance of the structural parameters is examined by computing
contours of constant chi squared in multi-dimensional parameter space.

varied morphologies covering the entire expected range from disks to tidally
distorted objects. The epoch of galaxy formation occurs early, about redshift
2.5 for 10^12 M_sun galaxies. Hierarchical formation naturally produces
correlations among the mass, age, morphology, and local density of galaxies
which match the trends in the observed morphology--density relation. We also
describe a method of spiral galaxy formation in which galactic disks form
through the discrete accretion of gas clouds which transport most of the

somewhat chaotic nature of hierarchical structure formation where simple
analytical ideas of spherical collapse appear incongruous.

the development of a factorization formalism for quarkonium production based on

$^{205}$Tl, $^{207,209}$PB, and $^{209}$Bi from the core polarization are
calculated in the random-phase approximation with the effective residual
interaction. Strong reduction of a valence nucleon contribution was found
provided by the core polarization effects. The contribution of the core
particles to the anapole moment compensates this reduction to large extent
keeping the magnitude of nuclear anapole moment close to its initial single
particle value.

4$, depending on a positive parameter $\epsilon$. If we set $\epsilon=0$, this
equation reduces to the well-known Kolmogorov-Petrovski-Piskunov equation. We
remark that, after a change of variables, this hyperbolic equation has the same
family of one-dimensional travelling waves as the KPP equation. Using various
energy functionals, we show that, if $\epsilon >0$, these fronts are locally
stable under perturbations in appropriate weighted Sobolev spaces. Moreover,
the decay rate in time of the perturbed solutions towards the front of minimal
speed $c=2$ is shown to be polynomial. In the one-dimensional case, if
$\epsilon < 1/4$, we can apply a Maximum Principle for hyperbolic equations and
prove a global stability result. We also prove that the decay rate of the
perturbated solutions towards the fronts is polynomial, for all $c > 2$.

asymptotic phase-space propagator for nonrelativistic scattering on a one -
dimensional barrier is constructed. The propagator has a form universal for
various initial state preparations and local potential barriers. It is
manifestly causal and includes time-lag effects and quantum spreading. Specific
features of quantum dynamics which disappear in the standard semi-classical
approximation are revealed. The propagator may be applied to calculation of the
final momentum and coordinate distributions, for particles transmitted through
or reflected from the potential barrier, as well as for elucidating the
tunneling time problem.

the model in terms of a random tiling ensemble with identical rectangles and

diagonalizing a transfer matrix using the Bethe Ansatz (BA). The BA equations
can be solved providing {\em exact} values of the entropy and elastic

obtained by solving the Eliashberg equations. We consider an electron-phonon
interaction in a strong coupling scenario. The Coulomb pseudopotential plays
the crucial role of providing the repulsion needed to favour the d-wave
symmetry. But the key parameter that allows very anisotropic solutions even
with very strong coupling is the small angular range of the interaction due to
predominantly electron-phonon forward scattering that is found in the high-Tc
superconductors. We find both s and d-wave solutions whose stability depends
mainly on the angular range of the interaction.
