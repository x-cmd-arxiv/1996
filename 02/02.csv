numerical simulations of the interstellar medium. Turbulent compression at the
interfaces of colliding gas streams is responsible for the formation of
intermediate ($\simlt 100$ pc) and small clouds (a few tens of pc), although
the smallest clouds can also form from fragmentation of expanding shells around
stellar heating centers. The largest cloud complexes (several hundred pc) seem
to form by slow, gravitational instability-driven merging of individual clouds,
which can actually be described as a large-scale tendency towards
homogenization of the flow due to gravity rather than cloud collisions. These
mechanisms operate as well in the presence of a magnetic field and rotation,
although slight variations on the compressibility and cloud morphology are
present which depend on the strength and topology of the field. In summary, the
role of turbulence in the life-cycle of clouds appears to be twofold:
small-scale modes contribute to cloud support, while large-scale modes can both
form or disrupt clouds.

Ia supernova SN1994D in the galaxy NGC 4526. The sensitivity of theoretical
light curves and spectra to the underlying hydrodynamical model is discussed.
  The calculations are consistent with respect to the explosion mechanism, the
optical and infrared light curves, and the spectral evolution, leaving the
description of the nuclear burning front and the structure of the white dwarf
as the only free parameters.
  The explosions are calculated using a one-dimensional Lagrangian code
including a nuclear network. Subsequently, the light curves are constructed.
Detailed NLTE-spectra are computed for several instants of time using the
density, chemical, and luminosity structure resulting from the light curve
code.
  Different scenarios have been compared to the observations including
detonations, deflagrations, delayed detonations, tamped detonations and Helium
detonations. Only one of our delayed detonations models shows good agreement
with the observations of SN1994D both for the B, V, R and I colors and the
spectral evolution. The classical deflagration model W7 does not reproduce the
high Si velocities as observed early on. The deflagration velocity is close to
the laminar deflagration $(v =0.03 c_s)$, and the transition from the
deflagration to the detonation occurs at $\rho_{tr} = 2.~10^7 g/cm^{3}$. The
initial central density of the white dwarf (WD) is $2.7~10^9 g/cm^{3}$.

the galactic halo may be in the form of white dwarfs, we study the implications
of such a halo. We first use current limits on the infrared background light
and the galactic metallicity to constrain the allowed initial mass function
(IMF) of the stellar population that produced the white dwarfs. The IMF must be
sharply peaked about a characteristic mass scale $M_C \approx 2.3 M_\odot$.
Since only a fraction of the initial mass of a star is incorporated into the
remnant white dwarf, we argue that the mass fraction of white dwarfs in the
halo is likely to be 25\% or less, and that 50\% is an extreme upper limit. We
use the IMF results to place corresponding constraints on the primordial
initial conditions for star formation. The initial conditions must be much more
homogeneous and skewed toward higher temperatures ($T_{\rm gas} \sim$ 200 K)
than the conditions which lead to the present day IMF. Next we determine the
luminosity function of white dwarfs. By comparing this result with the observed
luminosity function, we find that the age of the halo population must be
greater than $\sim 16$ Gyr. Finally, we calculate the radiative signature of a
white dwarf halo. This infrared background is very faint, but is potentially
detectable with future observations.

observed). The correlation can alternatively be explained by reprocessing of
X-rays and gamma-rays by a cold accretion disk. A specific model in which
X-rays and gamma-rays are emitted by a dissipative patchy corona and have the
spectrum cut off at about 100 keV (as seen by OSSE) is shown to be
energetically possible even if it does not give as satisfactory a fit as the

technology allows this to be achieved by a properly designed space mission that
fits well within the scope of NASA's Medium-class Explorer program. An
essential component of the mission design is an observing strategy that
minimizes systematic effects due to instrumental offset drifts. The detector
advances make possible a `spin chopping' approach that has significant
technical and scientific advantages over the strategy used by COBE, which
reconstructed an image of the sky via inversion of a large matrix of

increased sensitivity, and simplicity of instrumentation and spacecraft

symmetric Einstein-Maxwell spacetimes with a negative cosmological constant. We
impose boundary conditions that enforce every classical solution to be an
exterior region of a Reissner-Nordstr\""om-anti-de Sitter black hole with a
nondegenerate Killing horizon, with the spacelike hypersurfaces extending from
the horizon bifurcation two-sphere to the asymptotically anti-de Sitter
infinity. The constraints are simplified by a canonical transformation, which
generalizes that given by Kucha\v{r} in the spherically symmetric vacuum
Einstein theory, and the theory is reduced to its true dynamical degrees of
freedom. After quantization, the grand partition function of a thermodynamical
grand canonical ensemble is obtained by analytically continuing the Lorentzian
time evolution operator to imaginary time and taking the trace. A~similar
analysis under slightly modified boundary conditions leads to the partition
function of a thermodynamical canonical ensemble. The thermodynamics in each
ensemble is analyzed, and the conditions that the (grand) partition function be
dominated by a classical Euclidean black hole solution are found. When these
conditions are satisfied, we recover in particular the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy. The limit of a vanishing cosmological constant is briefly discussed.

effects characterized by a scale much higher than the electroweak scale. We
concentrate on the residual effects described by an effective lagrangian
involving only bosonic fields and restrict to the case that the Higgs field is
described linearly, so that the Higgs particle exists. It has already been
emphasized that this lagrangian may be represented by eight $dim=6$ operators;
namely the blind CP-conserving operators $\O_W$, $\O_{B\Phi}$, $\O_{W\Phi}$,
$\O_{UB}$, $\O_{UW}$, the ''superblind'' ${\cal O}_{\Phi 2}$ and the two
CP-violating ones $\ol{\O}_{UB}$ and $\ol{\O}_{UW}$. To each operator and for
any given value of its coupling, we associate an unambiguous NP scale
determined by the energy where unitarity is saturated. Our study of the
possible NP tests realizable at a future linear $e^+e^-$ collider concentrates
on $(e^+e^-\to HZ ~,~ H\gamma)$, and on $\gamma\gamma$ collisions producing
boson pairs ($\gamma\gamma \to W^+W^-$, $ZZ$, $Z\gamma$, $\gamma\gamma$, $HH$),
or a single Higgs ($\gamma\gamma \to H$). The sensitivities to the various
operators involved in the effective lagrangian are estimated. We find that the
testable NP scales vary from a few tens of TeV in the boson pair processes, up
to 65 TeV in single H production. Ways to disentangle the various operators are
also proposed. In this respect a comparison of the NP effects in the various
boson pair processes, like \eg\@ a comparison of $e^+e^-\to HZ$ versus
$e^+e^-\to H\gamma$, should be very fruitful. This is applied also to the study
of the Higgs branching ratios, and especially the ratio
$\Gamma(H\to\gamma\gamma)/\Gamma (H\to\gamma Z)$.

oscillations of the terrestrial neutrinos are characterized by three
parameters, $ \Delta m^2 = m_3^2 - m_1^2 $ and the squared moduli of the two
mixing matrix elements $U_{e3}$ and $U_{\mu3}$. Using the results of
disappearance experiments and solar neutrino experiments, it is shown that only
two regions of possible values of $|U_{e3}|^2$ and $|U_{\mu3}|^2$ are allowed:
I. $|U_{e3}|^2$ and $|U_{\mu3}|^2$ are both small and II. $|U_{e3}|^2$ is small
and $|U_{\mu3}|^2$ is large. If the mixing parameters are in the region I, $
\nu_\mu <-> \nu_e $ oscillations are suppressed. In this case the LSND
indication in favor of $ \nu_\mu <-> \nu_e $ oscillations is not compatible
with the negative results of all other experiments. If the mixing parameters
are in the region II, $ \nu_e <-> \nu_\tau $ oscillations are strongly
suppressed. If massive neutrinos are Majorana particles, our analysis shows
that neutrinoless double-beta decay could be observed in the experiments of the
next generation only if the mixing parameters are in the region I.

positive definite functions on G, is a Banach algebra when represented as an
algebra of completely bounded maps on a C^*-algebra associated with G. This
necessarily involves identifying equivalent elements of B(G). An example shows
that the linear span of the continuous positive definite functions need not be
complete. For groups, B(G) is isometric to the Banach space dual of C^*(G). For
groupoids, the best analog of that fact is to be found in a representation of
B(G) as a Banach space of completely bounded maps from a C^*-algebra associated
with G to a C^*-algebra associated with the equivalence relation induced by G.
This paper adds weight to the clues in the earlier study of Fourier-Stieltjes

energy values where appropriate truncations of the scattering matrix have zero
as eigenvalue. Scattering amplitudes on the physical sheet, necessary to
construct scattering matrix, are calculated on the basis of the Faddeev
differential equations. The algorithm developed is applied to search for the
resonances in the $nnp$ system and in a model three-boson system.

  Group Theory in Physics (Edirne, Turkey, 21-27 December 1995)",,,,"q-alg hep-th math.QA",,"  Contractions (and graded contractions) of Lie algebra, Lie bialgebra and Hopf
algebra are discussed. It is noticed the fundamental role of E.In{\""o}n{\""u}
and E.P.Wigner idea of degenerate transformations. A constructive algorithm for
description of contractions of quantum Cayley-Klein algebras $ so_{z}(n+1; {\bf
j}) $ with different choice of the set of primitive operators is suggested. For
nonsemisimple quantum algebras it gives nonisomorphic Hopf algebras. From
physical point of view this algorithm gives the different physical
interpretations of primitive operators for mathematically the same
nonsemisimple quantum algebra. The case of $ so_{z}(3; {\bf j}) $ is regarded
in detail.

algebraic structure of the linear space for which orthogonal subspaces
correspond to the propositions (equivalence classes of physical questions). The
projective geometry of the weakly modular orthocomplemented lattice of
propositions may be imbedded in a complex Hilbert space; this is the structure
which has traditionally been used. This paper reviews some work which has been
devoted to generalizing the target space of this imbedding to Hilbert modules
of a more general type. In particular, detailed discussion is given of the
simplest generalization of the complex Hilbert space, that of the quaternion
Hilbert module.
