  Proc. ``Mapping, Measuring and Modelling the Universe''. Eds.: P.Coles and
  V.Martinez. ASP conference series",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We review recent work aimed at showing how global topological defects
influence the shape of the angular power spectrum of the CMB radiation on small
scales. While Sachs-Wolfe fluctuations give the dominant contribution on
angular scales larger than about a few degrees, on intermediate scales the main
r\^ole is played by coherent oscillations in the baryon radiation plasma before
recombination. In standard cosmological models these oscillations lead to the
`Doppler peaks' in the angular power spectrum. Inflation-based cold dark matter
models predict the location of the first peak to be at $\ell\sim
220/\sqrt{\Omega_0}$, with a height which is a few times the level of
anisotropies at large scales. Here we focus on perturbations induced by global
textures. We find that the height of the first peak is reduced and is shifted
to $\ell\sim 350$.

a topological coupling. Unlike in the abelian case, the two-form cannot be
dualized to Goldstone bosons. Duality is restored by coupling a flat connection
to the theory in a particular way, and the new action is then dualized to a
non-linear sigma model. The presence of the flat connection is crucial, which
saves the original mechanism of Higgs-free topological mass generation from
being dualized to a sigma model.

changes the sign of the three form gauge field, acts on $S^1$ as a parity
transformation and on K3 as an involution with eight fixed points preserving
SU(2) holonomy. At a generic point in the moduli space the resulting theory has
as its low energy limit N=1 supergravity theory in six dimensions with eight
vector, nine tensor and twenty hypermultiplets. The gauge symmetry can be
enhanced (e.g. to $E_8$) at special points in the moduli space. At other
special points in the moduli space tensionless strings appear in the theory.

sums of squares of two vector fields in ${\mathbb R}^2$. This condition is
