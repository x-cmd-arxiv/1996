structure formation in the light of COBE and other data - {\it my favourite is
a flat spectrum of initial perturbations subsequently amplified by mixed hot

redshift (z<0.30) quasars observed with the Wide Field Camera-2 on the Hubble
Space Telescope. The HST resolution makes possible galaxy identification
brighter than V=23.5 and as close as 2'' to the quasar. We find a significant
enhancement of galaxies within a projected separation of < 100 kpc/h of the
quasars. If we model the qso/galaxy correlation function as a power law with a
slope given by the galaxy/galaxy correlation function, we find that the ratio
of the qso/galaxy to galaxy/galaxy correlation functions is $3.8\pm 0.8$. The
galaxy counts within r<15 kpc/h of the quasars are too high for the density
profile to have an appreciable core radius ( > 100 kpc). Our results reinforce
the idea that low redshift quasars are located preferentially in groups of
10-20 galaxies rather than in rich clusters. We see no significant difference
in the clustering amplitudes derived from radio-loud and radio-quiet
subsamples.

family of triaxial potentials that mimic the distribution of light in
elliptical galaxies. Some of the models include central point masses designed
to represent nuclear black holes. Most of the boxlike orbits are found to be
stochastic, with mean Liapunov times that are 3-6 times the period of the
long-axis orbit. In models with large cores or small black holes, the
stochastic orbits mimic regular box orbits for hundreds of oscillations at
least. However a small core radius or significant black hole mass causes most
of the stochastic orbits to diffuse through phase space on the same timescale,
visiting a significant fraction of the volume beneath the equipotential
surface. We estimate timescales for chaotic mixing in the more strongly
stochastic models by evolving ensembles of 10^4 points until their distribution
reaches a nearly steady state. Mixing initially takes place rapidly, with
characteristic times of 10-30 dynamical times, as the phase points fill a
region similar in shape to that of a box orbit. Subsequent mixing is slower,
with characteristic times of hundreds of orbital times. Mixing rates were found
to be enhanced by the addition of modest force perturbations. The consequences
for the structure and evolution of elliptical galaxies are discussed.

transport equations comply with relativistic causality. Thus, it is advisable
to use them instead of Eckart transport equations. In the inner layers of the
star the temperature ceases to be sensitive to the boundary condition. This
behavior, which can be explained in terms of the Eddington approximation,
allows us to find the thickness of the neutrinosphere. The dynamics of
collapsing dense stars is deeply influenced by the neutrino emission/absorption
processes. These cool the star and drive it to a new equilibrium state.
Therefore, the calculation of transport coefficients is based on these

system reaches a self-organized critical state with universal critical
exponents close to the mean-field values. The probability distributions follow
the general scaling form $P(X,L)= L^{-\alpha}{\cal{P}}(XL^{-D_X})$, where
$\alpha \approx 1$ is the scaling exponent for the distribution of avalanche

nonconservative dynamics---obtained by incomplete energy transfer at the defect
bonds--- the system is driven out of the critical state. In the scaling region

analogous to the visible one except that its `weak' scale is larger by one or
two orders of magnitude than the weak scale in the standard model. The mirror
neutrinos can mix the ordinary ones through the Planck scale induced higher
order operators, which can help to reconcile the present neutrino puzzles that
are the solar and atmospheric neutrino deficits, the recent LSND anomaly and
the need in the $\sim$ eV mass neutrino as the hot dark matter. In particular,
oscillation of $\nu_e$ into its mirror partner $\nu'_e$ emerges with parameters
naturally in the MSW range. The nucleosynthesis constraint on the extra light
particle species can be fulfilled by assuming the asymmetric postinflationary
reheating between the usual and mirror worlds. One implication of our proposal
is that bulk of the dark matter in the universe may be a warm dark matter
consisting of the keV range mirror neutrinos rather than the conventional cold
dark matter, while the mirror baryons can also contribute as dissipative dark
matter. Implications of the mirror Machos for microlensing experiments are also

independent of the values of the $Z'$ mass and couplings. This selects a

the two particles responsible for the singularities of the solution (the
magnetic monopole and the dyon of unit electric charge) are present in this
