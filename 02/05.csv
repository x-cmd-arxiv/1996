microwave background by allowing for the possibility that they are generated by
some as yet unknown source of gravitational perturbations. The acoustic {\it
pattern} of peak locations and relative heights predicted by the standard
inflationary cold dark matter model is essentially unique and its confirmation
would have deep implications for the causal structure of the early universe. A
generic pattern for isocurvature initial conditions arises due to backreaction
effects but is not robust to exotic source behavior inside the horizon. If
present, the acoustic pattern contains unambiguous information on the curvature
of the universe even in the general case. By classifying the behavior of the
unknown source, we determine the minimal observations necessary for robust
constraints on the curvature. The diffusion damping scale provides an entirely
model independent cornerstone upon which to build such a measurement. The peak
spacing, if regular, supplies a precision test.
