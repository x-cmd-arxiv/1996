2$) which degenerate into pairs of distinct lines over geometric points of a
smooth divisor, we prove a theorem which relates the Brauer class of the
non-degenerate conic on the complement of the divisor to the covering class
(Kummer class) of the 2-sheeted cover of the divisor defined by the degenerate
conic, via the Gysin homomorphism in etale cohomology. This theorem is the
algebro-geometric analogue of a topological result proved earlier.

well, a narrow square quantum well, and a heterostructure. For each system we
obtain the Coulomb pseudopotential parameters entering the exact
diagonalization calculation by using the realistic subband wave function from a
self-consistent electronic structure calculation within the local density
approximation (LDA) for a range of electron densities. We compare our realistic
LDA pseudopotential parameters with those from widely used simpler model
approximations in order to estimate the accuracies of the latter. We also
calculate the overlap between the exact numerical ground state and the
analytical Laughlin state as well as the excitation gap as a function of
density. For the three physical systems we consider the calculated overlap is
found to be large in the experimental electron density range. We compare our
calculated excitation gap energy to the experimentally obtained activated
transport energy gaps after subtracting out the effect of level broadening due
to collisions. The agreement between our calculated excitation gaps and the
experimental measurements is excellent.
