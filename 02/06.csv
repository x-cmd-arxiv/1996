  pages including 2 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The term ``violent relaxation'' was coined by Donald Lynden-Bell as a
memorable oxymoron describing how a stellar dynamical system relaxes from a
chaotic initial state to a quasi-equilibrium. His analysis showed that this
process is rapid, even for systems with many stars, and that it leads to
equilibria which may plausibly be related to bounded isothermal spheres. I
review how numerical simulations have improved our understanding of violent
relaxation over the last thirty years. It is clear that the process leads to
equilibria which depend strongly on the initial state, but which nevertheless
have certain common features. A particularly interesting case concerns objects
formed in an expanding universe through dissipationless hierarchical clustering
from gaussian initial conditions; these may correspond to galaxy clusters or to
the dark halos of galaxies. While such objects display a wide range of shapes
and spins, the distributions of these properties depend only weakly on the
cosmological context and on the initial spectrum of density fluctuations. Halo
density profiles appear to have a universal form with a singular central
structure and a characteristic density which depends only on formation epoch.
Low mass halos typically have earlier formation times and thus higher
characteristic densities than high mass halos.

with 3 < z < 3.5 is $0.4\pm0.07$ galaxies arcmin$^{-2}$, approximately 1.3\% of
the deep counts at these magnitudes; this value applies both to ``random''
fields and to fields centered on known QSOs. The corresponding co-moving space
density is approximately half that of luminous ($L \simgt L^{\ast}$)
present--day galaxies. Our sample of $z > 3$ galaxies is large enough that we
can begin to detail the spectroscopic characteristics of the population as a
whole. The spectra of the $z>3$ galaxies are remarkably similar to those of
nearby star-forming galaxies, the dominant features being strong
low--ionization interstellar absorption lines and high--ionization stellar
lines, often with P-Cygni profiles characteristic of Wolf-Rayet and O--star
winds. Lyman $\alpha$ emission is generally weak ($< 20$ \AA\ rest equivalent
width) and is absent for >50% of the galaxies. The star formation rates,
measured directly from the far-UV continua, lie in the range 4-25 $h_{50}^{-2}$
M$\sun$ yr$^{-1}$ for $q_0=0.5$. Together with the morphological properties of
the $z>3$ galaxy population, which we discuss in a companion paper (Giavalisco

high-redshift counterparts of the spheroid component of present--day luminous

analysis has been applied to estimate SIMULTANEOUSLY the best fit parameters of

blanketing of weak lines, we confirm that the column density distribution is
best represented by a double power-law with a break at logN_{HI}\simeq14, with
a slope beta_s=1.8 for higher column densities and a flatter slope beta_f=1.4

between this structure and the terminal bow shock. In a few cases, there is no
evidence of such a terminal feature. We present three-dimensional smoothed
particle hydrodynamical simulations which suggest that this morphology may be
due to the interaction of the propagating cooling jet with a non-homogeneous
ambient medium. In regions where the ambient gas has an increasing density (and
pressure) gradient, we find that it tends to compress the cold, low-pressure
cocoon of shocked material that surrounds the beam, destroy the bow shock-like
structure at the head, and enhance beam focusing, wiggling, and internal
traveling shocks. In ambient regions of decreasing density (and pressure), the
flow widens and relaxes, becoming very faint. This could explain ``invisible''
segments in systems like the Haro 6-5B jet. The bow shock in these cases could
be a relic of an earlier outflow episode, as previously suggested, or the place
where the jet reappears after striking a denser portion of the ambient medium.

been obscure for years. In this paper we give the solution of the longstanding
problem. With the aid of the $d=\infty$ approximation, we study this problem on

as well as that of its first excitations, is nearly identical to the

medium is studied within the context of disoriented chiral condensates. We use
out of equilibrium closed time path methods in field theory combined with the
amplitude expansion. We give explicit expressions for the asymptotic space-time
evolution of an initial inhomogeneous configuration including the contribution
of thresholds at zero and non-zero temperature. At non-zero temperature we find
new relaxational processes due to thermal cuts that have no counterpart in the
homogeneous case. Within the one-loop approximation, we find that the space
time evolution of such inhomogeneous configuration out of equilibrium is
effectively described in terms of a rapidity dependent temperature
$T(\vartheta)=T/\cosh[\vartheta]$ as well as a rapidity dependent decay rate
$\Gamma(\vartheta, T(\vartheta))$. This rate is to be interpreted as the
production minus absorption rate of pions in the medium and approaches the zero
temperature value at large rapidities. An initial configuration localized on a
bounded region spreads and decays in spherical waves with slower relaxational
dynamics at large rapidity.

resonance $\omega=\omega_{Be}+kv_{\|}$ interaction (ACRI) of energetic
electrons with a ducted finite amplitude whistler-mode wave propagating through
the so-called transient plasma layer (TPL) in the magnetosphere or in the
ionosphere is studied both analytically and numerically. The anomalous
cyclotron resonance interaction takes place in the case when the whistler-mode
wave amplitude $B_{W}$ is consistent with the gradient of magnetic field
$\overrightarrow{B_0}$. The region of phase space occupied by anomalously
interacting energetic electrons (synchronous particles) is determined. The
efficiencies of both the pitch-angle scattering of resonant electrons and their
transverse acceleration are studied and the efficiencies dependence on the
magnitude and sign of the wave frequency drift is considered. It has been shown
that in the case of ACRI occuring under conditions relevant to VLF-emission in
the magnetosphere, the energy and pitch-angle changes of synchronous electrons
may be enchanced by a factor $10^2 \div 10^3$ in comparison with ones for
nonsynchronous resonant electrons. So the small in density group of synchronous
particles may give significant contribution to a whistler-mode wave damping in
TPL.
