  rings","LaTeX2e",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  We show that the number of parameters for CM-modules of prescribed rank is
semi-continuous in families of CM rings of Krull dimension 1. This transfers a
result of Knoerrer from the commutative to the not necessarily commutative
case. For this purpose we introduce the notion of ``dense subrings'' which
seems rather technical but, nevertheless, useful. It enables the construction
of ``almost versal'' families of modules for a given algebra and the definition
of the ``number of parameters''. The semi--continuity implies, in particular,
that the set of so-called ``wild algebras'' in any family is a countable union
of closed subsets. A very exciting problem is whether it is actually closed,
hence whether the set of tame algebras is open. However, together with the
results of a former paper of the authors the semi-continuity implies that tame
is indeed an open property for curve singularities (commutative CM rings). An
analogous procedure leads to the semicontinuity of the number of parameters in
other cases, like representations of finite dimensional algebras or finite
dimensional bimodules.

to be determined by the density profiles rho(r) and the mass distribution n(M)
of virialized halos. The Press--Schechter approach is used to compute n(M), and
the stable clustering hypothesis is used to determine the density profiles of
these Press--Schechter halos. Thus, the shape and amplitude of xi(r) on small
scales is related to the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations.
  The case of clustering from scale-free initial conditions is treated in
detail. If n is the slope of the initial power spectrum of density
fluctuations, then stable clustering requires that xi(r)\propto r^{-gamma},
where gamma is a known function of n. If halo--halo correlations can be
neglected, then rho(r)\propto r^{-epsilon}, where epsilon = (gamma+3)/2 =
3(4+n)/(5+n). For all values of n of current interest, this slope is steeper
than the value 3(3+n)/(4+n) that was obtained by Hoffman & Shaham in their
treatment of the shapes of the outer regions of collapsed halos. Our main
result is a prediction for the amplitude of the non-linear correlation
function. The predicted amplitude and its dependence on n are in good
quantitative agreement with N-body simulations of self-similar clustering.
  If stable clustering is a good approximation only inside the half-mass radii
of Press--Schechter halos, then the density contrast required for the onset of
stable clustering can be estimated. This density contrast is in the range
~300-600 and increases with the initial slope n, in agreement with estimates
from N-body simulations.

two-neutrino flavor mixing can be applied directly to three-neutrino mixing in
the case where one vacuum neutrino mass eigenvalue difference dominates the
others. We show that in this ``one mass scale dominance'' limit, a natural
three-neutrino oscillation solution meeting all the above constraints exists
only if the atmospheric neutrino data {\em and} the LSND data can be explained
with one neutrino mass difference. In this model, an explanation for the solar
neutrino data can be effected by employing the {\em other} independent neutrino
mass difference. Such a solution is only marginally allowed by the current
data, and proposed long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments can
definitively rule it out. If it were ruled out, the simultaneous solution of
the above constraints by neutrino oscillations would then require sterile
neutrinos and/or a neutrino mass hierarchy of a different nature than that of
the charged leptons.

quantum Hall states, namely the Pfaffian, Haldane-Rezayi and 331 states, are
constructed and the states at each angular momentum level are enumerated. The
method is based on finding all the zero energy states for those Hamiltonians
for which each of these known ground states is the exact, unique, zero-energy
eigenstate of lowest angular momentum in the disk geometry. For each state, we
find that, in addition to the usual bosonic charge-fluctuation excitations,
there are fermionic edge excitations. The edge states can be built out of
quantum fields that describe the fermions, in addition to the usual scalar
bosons (or Luttinger liquids) that describe the charge fluctuations. The
fermionic fields in the Pfaffian and 331 cases are a non-interacting Majorana
(i.e., real Dirac) and Dirac field, respectively. For the Haldane-Rezayi state,
the field is an anticommuting scalar. For this system we exhibit a chiral
Lagrangian that has manifest SU(2) symmetry but breaks Lorentz invariance
because of the breakdown of the spin statistics connection implied by the
scalar nature of the field and the positive definite norm on the Hilbert space.
Finally we consider systems on a cylinder where the fluid has two edges and
construct the sectors of zero energy states, discuss the projection rules for
combining states at the two edges, and calculate the partition function for
each edge excitation system at finite temperature in the thermodynamic limit.
It is pointed out that the conformal field theories for the edge states are
examples of orbifold constructions.

topology on scales significantly smaller than the horizon are not ruled out by
previous analyses focussing on this special case. We show that in these small

Since the surface of last scattering is a sphere, these intersections will be

proton-neutron pairing method (full-RQRPA) for nuclear structure studies, which
includes ground state correlation beyond the QRPA. This is achieved by using of
renormalized quasi-boson approximation, in which the Pauli exclusion principle
is taken into account more carefully. The full-RQRPA has been applied to
two-neutrino double beta decay of $^{76}Ge$, $^{82}Se$, $^{128}Te$ and
$^{130}Te$. The nuclear matrix elements have been found significantly less
sensitive to the increasing strength of particle-particle interaction in the
physically interesting region in comparison with QRPA results. The strong
differences between the results of both methods indicate that the Pauli
exclusion principle plays an important role in the evaluation of the double
beta decay. The inclusion of the Pauli principle removes the difficulties with
the strong dependence on the particle-particle strength $g_{pp}$ in the QRPA on
the two-neutrino double beta decay.

could be nonlinearly unstable and cause anomalous transport) are investigated
in the framework of linearized collisionless Maxwell-drift kinetic theory for
the case of equilibria of magnetically confined, circularly cylindrical plasmas

non-vanishing component parallel to the magnetic field, the plane equilibrium
conditions (derived by Throumoulopoulos and Pfirsch [Phys Rev. E {\bf 49}, 3290
(1994)]) are shown to remain valid, while the condition for perpendicular
perturbations (which are found to be the most important modes) is modified.
Consequently, besides the tokamak equilibrium regime in which the existence of
negative-energy perturbations is related to the threshold value of 2/3 of the
quantity $\eta_\nu = \frac {\partial \ln T_\nu} {\partial \ln N_\nu}$, a new
regime appears, not present in plane equilibria, in which negative-energy
perturbations exist for {\em any} value of $\eta_\nu$. For various analytic
cold-ion tokamak equilibria a substantial fraction of thermal electrons are
associated with negative-energy perturbations (active particles). In
particular, for linearly stable equilibria of a paramagnetic plasma with flat
electron temperature profile ($\eta_e=0$), the entire velocity space is
occupied by active electrons. The part of the velocity space occupied by active
particles increases from the center to the plasma edge and is larger in a
paramagnetic plasma than in a diamagnetic plasma with the same pressure
profile. It is also shown that, unlike in plane equilibria, negative-energy
perturbations exist in force-free reversed-field pinch equilibria with a
substantial fraction of active particles.
