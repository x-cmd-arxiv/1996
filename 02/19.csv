mass, linear and angular momentum in a binary system where one component
undergoes mass loss through a wind. Physical parameters are chosen such as to
model the alleged binary precursors of barium stars, whose chemical
peculiarities are believed to result from the accretion of the wind from a
companion formerly on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). The binary system
modelled consists of a 3 solar masses AGB star on the main sequence, in a 3AU
circular orbit. Three-dimensional simulations are performed for gases with
polytropic indices gamma=1, 1.1 and 1.5, to bracket more realistic situations
that would include radiative cooling. Mass accretion rates are found to depend
on resolution and we estimate typical values of 1-2% for the gamma=1.5 case and
8% for the other models. The highest resolution obtained (with 400k particles)
corresponds to an accretor of linear size 16 solar radii. Despite being (in the
gamma = 1.5 case) about ten times smaller than theoretical estimates based on
the Bondi-Hoyle prescription, the SPH accretion rates remain large enough to
explain the pollution of barium stars. Uncertainties in the current SPH rates
remain however, due to the simplified treatment of the wind acceleration
mechanism, as well as to the absence of any cooling prescription and to the
limited numerical resolution. Angular momentum transfer leads to significant
spin up of the accretor and can account for the rapid rotation of HD165141, a
barium star with a young white dwarf companion and a rotation rate unusually
large among K giants.

identified using a well-known cluster analysis technique. Our final list
consists of 12 groups, including one reported previously. Most of the quasars
in these groups come from deep homogeneous surveys. We have found that: (i) the
probability that the detected groups are random is rather small (generally a
few per cent); (ii) their sizes range from $\sim 70$ to $\sim 160h^{-1} Mpc$,
which is comparable to sizes of nearby rich superclusters; (iii) the detected
groups all have redshifts $0.5<z\leq 2$; (iv) the abundance of the LQGs is
comparable with the abundance of large superclusters at $z\sim 0$, which is
consistent with the idea that quasar groups and superclusters can be
evolutionarily related. We argue that quasar groups could be a common feature
of the spatial distribution of medium redshift quasars, and that the quasars in
groups may belong to concentrations of young galaxy clusters and groups
(distant superclusters) and hence be biased tracers of large-scale structure of
matter distribution in the early Universe. Theoretical implications as well as
other observations needed to test this point are discussed.

cluster selection criteria and other uncertain factors influence the cluster
correlation function. We consider the effects of varying the definition of a
cluster, the mean number density (or equivalently the richness) in a catalogue,
and the assumed normalisation of the model; we also examine the importance of
redshift space distortions. We implement five different group-finding
algorithms and construct cluster catalogues defined by mass, velocity
dispersion or a measure of X-ray luminosity. We find that different cluster
catalogues yield correlation functions which can differ by substantially more
than the statistical errors in any one determination. For a given cluster
selection criteria, the correlation length typically varies by $\sim 20\%$ in
catalogues spanning the range of intercluster separations covered by the APM
and Abell (richness class $\gsim 1$) catalogues. Distortions produced by
peculiar velocities in redshift space enhance the correlation function at large
separations and lead to a larger clustering length in redshift space than in
real space. The sensitivity of the cluster correlation function to various
uncertain model assumptions substantially weakens previous conclusions based on
the comparison of model predictions with real data. Detailed modelling of
cluster selection procedures including the effects of selecting from projected
galaxy catalogues is required before the cluster correlation function can be
regarded as a high precision constraint on cosmological models.

Leslie and Quarini on graded filters in the EDQNM closure is shown to be
unrelated to the cancellation we establish in Navier-Stokes solutions. The

popular models of the subgrid stress (Smagorinsky, Bardina, etc.) We also
examine the effects of the choice of filter function on the magnitudes of
subgrid stress and transfer. Under mild assumptions on the filter these

modest required conditions and we show that the associated flux, including
``backscatter'' effects, may be spuriously dominated by nonlocal-in-wavenumber,

harmonic bonds. For such a system there is at high temperatures an approximate
scaling of global properties like the end-to-end distance and the interaction
energy with the chain-length divided by the temperature. This scaling is broken
at low temperatures by the ultraviolet divergence of the Coulomb potential. By
introducing a renormalization of the strength of the nearest- neighbour
interaction the scaling is restored, making possible an efficient blocking
method for emulating very large polyelectrolytes using small systems. The high
temperature behaviour is well reproduced by the analytical high-$T$ expansions
even for fairly low temperatures and system sizes. In addition, results from
low-$T$ expansions, where the coefficients have been computed numerically, are
presented. These results approximate well the corresponding Monte Carlo results
at realistic temperatures. A corresponding analysis of screened chains is
performed. The situation here is complicated by the appearance of an additional
parameter, the screening length. A window is found in parameter space, where
scaling holds for the end-to-end distance. This window corresponds to
situations where the range of the potential interpolates between the bond
length and the size of the chain. This scaling behaviour, which is verified by
Monte Carlo results, is consistent with Flory scaling. Also for the screened
chain a blocking approach can be devised, that performs well for low
temperatures, whereas the low-$T$ expansion is inaccurate at realistic
temperatures.

acquire negative kinetic terms. Recently Duff, Minasian and Witten (DMW)
suggested a solution to this problem which only works if the compactification

check the consistency of these dualities by studying the different large $T,S$
