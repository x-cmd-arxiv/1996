  systems","To be published in J.Phys.Soc.Jpn",,"10.1143/JPSJ.65.1056",,"cond-mat",,"  Keeping nickel, cobalt and iron in mind, we investigate the origin of the
itinerant ferromagnetism. In so doing, we generalize the Gutzwiller
approximation. In that,we take account of the effect of the band degeneracy and
the Hund's-rule coupling in addition to the on-site repulsion. After the
discussion on nickel, the condition for the incomplete ferromagnetism, observed
in cobalt and iron, is argued. Phase diagrams, which show the interplay between
the band shape peculiarity and the Hund's-rule coupling, are given. It is found
that for the $3d$-transition metal systems, both of the Hund's-rule coupling
and the special feature of the density of states are necessary to explain the
itinerant ferromagnetism.

  Transistors","RevTeX, 12 pages, 4 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.54.7421",,"cond-mat",,"  Charge is transported through superconducting SSS single-electron transistors
at finite bias voltages by a combination of coherent Cooper-pair tunneling and
quasiparticle tunneling. At low transport voltages the effect of an ``odd''
quasiparticle in the island leads to a $2e$-periodic dependence of the current
on the gate charge. We evaluate the $I-V$ characteristic in the framework of a
model which accounts for these effects as well as for the influence of the
electromagnetic environment. The good agreement between our model calculation
and experimental results demonstrates the importance of coherent Cooper-pair
tunneling and parity effects.

is determined by the Majorana mass of neutrino and it is very small that leads
to the existence of longlived ($ T \geq O(10^{-4}sec$) lightest superparticle.
If lightest superparticle is righthanded charged slepton that can be realized
within gaugino dominated scenario then the phenomenology of such model differs
in a drastic way from the standard SUSY phenomenology, in particular, longlived
charged sleptons can form bound states with ordinary matter - quasistable
supermatter (SUSY analogs of mu-atoms and muonium). We discuss possible
manifestations of the existence of such longlived charged particle at LEP2,
TEVATRON and LHC. We also construct $SU(3) \otimes SU(2)_{L} \otimes SU(2)_{R}
\otimes U(1)$ model with Majorana mass and superweak R-parity violation.

an injection from bound states of the three-dimensional radial Coulomb system
into a three-dimensional radial isotropic oscillator where one of the two
systems has an analytical quantum defect. The issue of mapping the continuum
states is briefly considered.
