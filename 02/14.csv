hydrodynamic solver and a gravity solver is discussed. We show that
straightforward combining those two solvers generally leads to a code that does
not conserve energy locally, and instead a special Consistency Condition ought
to be satisfied. A particular example of combining Softened Lagrangian
Hydrodynamics (SLH) with a P3M gravity solver is used to demonstrate the effect
of the Consistency Condition for a self-gravitating hydrodynamic code. The need
to supplement the SLH method with the P3M gravity solver arose because the
Moving Mesh Gravity solver, used in conjunction with the SLH method previously,
was found to produce inaccurated results. We also show that most existing
cosmological hydrodynamic codes implicitly satisfy the Consistency Condition.

luminosity function may be fit by a Schechter function with $M^* = -20.29 \pm

We compare our luminosity function to that from other redshift surveys; in
particular our normalization is consistent with that of the Stromlo-APM survey,
and is therefore a factor of two below that implied by the $b_J \approx 20$
bright galaxy counts. Our normalization thus indicates that much more evolution
is needed to match the faint galaxy count data, compared to minimal evolution
models which normalize at $b_J \approx 20$. Also, we show that our faint-end
slope $\alpha = -0.7$, though ``shallower'' than typical previous values
$\alpha = -1$, results primarily from fitting the detailed shape of the LCRS
luminosity function, rather than from any absence of intrinsically faint
galaxies from our survey. Finally, using [OII] 3727 equivalent width
$W_{\lambda} = 5$~\AA \ as the dividing line, we find significant differences
in the luminosity functions of emission and non-emission galaxies, particularly
in their $\alpha$ values. Emission galaxies have Schechter parameters $M^* =

galaxies are described by $M^* = -20.22 \pm 0.02 + 5 \log h$ and $\alpha = -0.3

compared with observed ones of several galactic globular clusters (M30, M92,
M68, NGC6397, M4, M80, NGC6352, NGC1851). Contrary to earlier results of
Faulkner & Stetson (1993) and Bolte (1994) we find no significant discrepancy
that could indicate the neglect of important physical effects in the models.
However, it is confirmed that the subgiant branch is the most sensitive part
and shows the largest deviations in the luminosity function comparison, if
parameters are unappropriate. We also find that the main sequence is suited
less than the Red Giant Branch for the calibration of theoretical luminosity
functions. While for individual clusters different changes in the model
assumptions might resolve mismatches, there is no systematic trend visible. It
rather appears that the quality of the luminosity function in the subgiant part
is insufficient and that improved observations of this particular region are
necessary for a better comparison. At the present quality of luminosity
functions theory is in agreement with observation and a postulation of WIMPs
acting in stellar cores does not seem to be justified. Actually, fits using
isothermal core models on the main sequence appear to be worse than those with
standard stellar evolution assumptions.

that as far as the initial contraction phases are concerned, the radial

of the density profiles and virial ratios. This implies that velocity

  and the Evolution of the Universe,"" 7-10 November 1995, University of Tokyo",,,,"gr-qc",,"  Based on a thoeretical model in which scalar fields play crucial roles, we
propose a mechanism to better understand a cosmological constant expected to be
small (nearly comparable with the critical density) but nonzero as suggested
strongly by the recent observations. We emphasize that a step further is needed
beyond the simplest scenario of a decaying cosmological constant, according to
which the effective $\Lambda$ is not a true constant but decays like $t^{-2}$,
thus explaining why any effect of $\Lambda$ which is assumed to be of the
Planckian order of magnitude in the earliest Universe is at most 120 orders
smaller today ($t\sim 10^{60}$ in units of the Planck time), without any
extreme fine-tuning of the parameters. In addition to the overall smooth
fall-off $\sim t^{-2}$, the total energy density, the sum of the contributions
from the ordinary matter and the scalar fields, must show some leveling-off
behavior, hence mimicking a truly constant $\Lambda$ to fit the observations.
We find that the desired behavior can be obtained by introducing two scalar
fields interacting with each other in a specific manner. Many aspects of this
model are discussed in detail, including the real origin of the whole
mechanism, and how the parameters and the initial conditions of the theory can
be determined by the cosomological parameters at the present epoch as well as
the past history of the Universe.

equations, the binary collisions involving a $\Delta$ resonance in either the
entrance channel or the exit channel are investigated within a Hamiltonian
formulation of $\pi NN$ interactions. An averaging procedure is developed to
define a quasi-particle $\Delta^*$ and to express the experimentally measured
$NN\rightarrow \pi NN$ cross section in terms of an effective $NN\rightarrow
N\Delta^\ast$ cross section. In contrast to previous works, the main feature of
the present approach is that the mass and the momentum of the produced
$\Delta^*$'s are calculated dynamically from the bare $\Delta \leftrightarrow
\pi N$ vertex interaction of the model Hamiltonian and are constrained by the
unitarity condition. The procedure is then extended to define the effective
cross sections for the experimentally inaccessible $N\Delta^\ast \rightarrow
NN$ and $N\Delta^\ast \rightarrow N\Delta^\ast$ reactions. The predicted cross
sections are significantly different from what are commonly assumed in
relativistic heavy-ion calculations. The $\Delta$ potential in nuclear matter
has been calculated by using a Bruckner-Hartree-Fock approximation. By
including the mean-field effects on the $\Delta$ propagation, the effective
cross sections of the $NN\rightarrow N\Delta^\ast$, $N\Delta^\ast \rightarrow
NN$ and $N\Delta^\ast \rightarrow N\Delta^\ast$ reactions in nuclear matter are
predicted. It is demonstrated that the density dependence is most dramatic in
the energy region close to the pion production threshold.

channels approach in momentum space using an elementary production operator
that includes Born terms, vector meson exchange and $M1/E2$ $\Delta$-resonance
excitation. The final state interaction is treated in the KMT multiple
scattering approach that describes $\pi d$ elastic scattering well.
Differential cross sections are found to agree well with existing ($\gamma,
\pi^0$) data. The polarization observables $\Sigma , iT_{11}$ and the tensor
analyzing powers are predicted for forthcoming experiments. A number of
transparent relationships between polarization observables and the elementary
production operator is derived. Finally, calculations are performed for
coherent eta photoproduction, $d (\gamma, \eta)d$, in the threshold region
which agree well with a very recent Mainz experiment.

backward angles, discrepancies appear that are reminiscent of disagreements in
pion scattering on $^3$He, $^3$H, and $^4$He. At low energies the second order
corrections have been included. Polarization observables are studied in detail.

exhibit dramatic discrepancies.

large-scale spiral rotation. We observed multi-armed spirals for which the two

system can evolve according to an effective non hermitian Hamiltonian. To each
eigenvalue of a non hermitian Hamiltonian is associated an eigenstate
$\vert\phi\rangle$ which evolves forward in time and an eigenstate
$\langle{\psi}\vert$ which evolves backward in time. Quantum measurements on
such systems are analyzed in detail with particular emphasis on adiabatic
measurements in which the measuring device is coupled weakly to the system. It
is shown that in this case the outcome of the measurement of an observable $A$
is the weak value $\langle{\psi}\vert A\vert\phi\rangle /
\langle{\psi}\vert{\phi}\rangle $ associated to the two-state vector
$\langle{\psi}\vert$ $\vert\phi\rangle$ corresponding to one of the eigenvalues
of the non hermitian Hamiltonian. The possibility of performing such
