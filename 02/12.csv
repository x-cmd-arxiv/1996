profile of dark-matter halos can be described by a universal two-parameter
function over a broad range of halo masses. The profile is singular,
approaching the halo center with $\rho\propto r^{-1}$. It had been argued
previously that radially distorted, gravitationally lensed images of background
sources in galaxy clusters, so-called radial arcs, required a flat core in the
cluster density profile. Such radial arcs have so far been detected in two
galaxy clusters, in apparent contradiction with a singular density profile. I
show here that the profile suggested by Navarro et al. can produce radial arcs
despite its central singularity, and describe how the two parameters of the
profile can be determined in clusters where radial and tangential arcs are
observed. I then apply this analysis to the two clusters where radial arcs were
detected. In both cases, the redshifts of the radial arcs are yet unknown,
hence definitive conclusions on the profile parameters cannot yet be drawn.
Numerically determined values for the parameters of cluster-sized halos can,
however, be used to predict the range of the unknown arc redshifts, thus
providing a direct observational test for the proposed density profile. A
potential difficulty with the profile is that the radial magnification of
tangential arcs is large, hence tangential arcs should be thick or their
sources should be very thin in the radial direction.

Universe expansion rate and the effect of the field on the electrons quantum
statistics. Although, in order to get an upper limit on the field strength, the
weight of the former effect is numerically larger, the latter cannot be
neglected. Including both effects in the PN code we get the upper limit $B \le
1\times 10^{11}$ Gauss at the temperature $T = 10^9~^oK$. We generalize the
considerations to cases when instead the magnetic is inhomogeneous on the

(HUT) during the Astro-1 space shuttle mission in 1990 December. The cluster's
far-UV integrated spectrum shows strong absorption in the Lyman lines of atomic
hydrogen. We seek to use this spectrum, together with optical photometry, to
constrain the stellar mass distribution along its zero-age horizontal branch
(ZAHB). We find that a Gaussian distribution of ZAHB masses, with a mean of
0.59 Msun and standard deviation 0.05 Msun, is able to reproduce the cluster's
(B,V) color-magnitude diagram when subsequent stellar evolution is taken into
account, but cannot reproduce the cluster's far-UV spectrum. Model stellar
spectra fit directly to the HUT data indicate a surprising distribution of
atmospheric parameters, with surface gravities (and thus implied masses)
significantly lower than are predicted by canonical HB evolutionary models.
This result is consistent with the findings of Moehler et al. [A&A, 294, 65
(1995)] for individual HB stars in M15. Further progress in understanding the
mass distribution of the HB must await resolution of the inconsistencies
between the derived stellar atmospheric parameters and the predictions of HB
evolutionary models. Improved stellar spectral models, with higher spectral
resolution and non-solar abundance ratios, may prove useful in this endeavor.

renormalization constants and effective actions in Yang-Mills theory. We
display the multiloop string formulas needed to compute Yang-Mills amplitudes,
and we discuss how the renormalizations of proper vertices can be extracted in
the field theory limit. We show how string techniques lead to the background
field method in field theory, and indicate how the gauge invariance of the
multiloop effective action can be inferred form the string formalism.

A11 (1996) 2933-2940","10.1142/S0217732396002903","SINP/TNP/96-02","hep-th",,"  For extremal charged black holes, the thermodynamic entropy is proportional
not to the area but to the mass or charges. This is demonstrated here for
dyonic extremal black hole solutions of string theory. It is pointed out that
these solutions have zero classical action although the area is nonzero. By
combining the general form of the entropy allowed by thermodynamics with recent
observations in the literature it is possible to fix the entropy almost
completely.

with these calculations is good.

class of scalar products parametrized by a family of world-vectors. The choice
of null and $p$-dependent world-vectors leads to BW amplitudes which behave as
local $SU(2)$ spinors (BW-spinors) if {\it passive\/} transformations are
concerned. The choice of null directions leads to a simplified formalism which
allows for an application of ordinary, manifestly covariant spinor techniques
in the context of infinite dimensional unitary representations of the
Poincar\'e group.
