compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy NGC~2915. NGC~2915 has the HI properties of a late
type spiral galaxy (Sd - Sm), including a double horn global profile, and HI
spiral arms. The HI extends out to over five times the Holmberg radius. The
optical counterpart corresponds to a central HI bar. The rotation curve is
derived and fitted with a mass model consisting of a stellar disk, a neutral
gas disk, and a dark matter (DM) halo. The DM halo dominates at nearly all
radii. The total mass to blue light ratio is 76 within the last measured point,
making NGC~2915 one of the darkest disk galaxies known. The core of the DM halo
is unusually dense (rho_0 ~ 0.1, M_sun pc^{-3}) and compact (R_core approx 1
kpc). The neutral gas component, with mass M_g = 1.27x10^9 M_sun is probably
more massive than the stellar component. Split and broad HI lines (line of
sight velocity dispersion, sigma ~ 35 km/s) are seen in the central region.
Pressure support is probably significant, and it is not clear whether the core
is in equilibrium. Beyond the Holmberg radius, the average HI sigma is 8 km/s,
which is normal for disk galaxies. NGC~2915 does not obey the Tully-Fisher
(1977) relation, being underluminous by a factor of nine. A simple HI surface
density threshold of about 10^{21} cm^{-2} adequately describes the location of
current star formation. The HI properties are compared to ""normal"" disk
galaxies and other BCDS.

at such a high redshift. We detect tangential shear at the 5% - 10% level over
a range of radii 50'' < r < 250'' centered on the optical position of the
cluster. Two-dimensional mass reconstruction using galaxies with 21.5 < I <
25.5 shows a strong peak which coincides with the peak of the smoothed cluster
light distribution. Splitting this sample by magnitude (at I = 23.5) and color
(at R-I = 0.7), we find that the brighter and redder subsamples are only very
weakly distorted, indicating that the faint blue galaxies (FBG's), which
dominate the shear signal, are relatively more distant. The derived cluster
mass is quite sensitive to the N(z) for the FBG's. At one extreme, if all the
FBG's are at z_s = 3, then the mass within a $0.5h^{-1}$Mpc aperture is $(5.9
\pm 1.24)\times 10^{14}$\h1 $M_\odot$, and the mass-to-light ratio is $M/L_V =
350 \pm 70 h$ in solar units. For $z_s = 1.5$ the derived mass is $\sim$70\%
higher and $M/L \simeq 580 h$. If $N(z)$ follows the no evolution model (in
shape) then $M/L \simeq 800h$, and if all the FBG's lie at $z_s\la 1$ the
required $M/L$ exceeds $1600h$. These data provide clear evidence that large,
dense mass concentrations existed at early epochs; that they can be weighed
efficiently by weak lensing observations; and that most of the FBG's are at
high redshift.

walls) in quasi-one dimensional ferromagnets. Within a coherent state path
integral approach we derive a quantum field theory for nonuniform spin
configurations. The effective action for the soliton position is shown to
contain a gauge potential due to the Berry phase and a damping term caused by
the interaction between soliton and spin waves. For temperatures below the
anisotropy gap this dissipation reduces to a pure soliton mass renormalization.
The gauge potential strongly affects the quantum dynamics of the soliton in a
periodic lattice or pinning potential. For half-integer spin, destructive
interference between soliton states of opposite chirality suppresses nearest
neighbor hopping. Thus the Brillouin zone is halved, and for small mixing of
the chiralities the dispersion reveals a surprising dynamical correlation: Two
subsequent band minima belong to different chirality states of the soliton. For
integer spin, the Berry phase is inoperative and a simple tight-binding
dispersion is obtained. Finally it is shown that external fields can be used to
interpolate continuously between the Bloch wall dispersions for half-integer
and integer spin.

instabilities in the `chain' state. It has been found that the lattice is
stable at large fields, but that instabilities occur as the field is reduced.
The field at which these instabilities first arise, $b^*(\epsilon,\theta)$,
depends on the anisotropy $\epsilon$ and the angle $\theta$ at which the
lattice is tilted away from the $c$-axis. These instabilities initially occur
at wavevector $k^*(\epsilon,\theta)$, and the component of $k^*$ along the
average direction of the flux lines, $k_z$, is always finite. As the
instability occurs at finite $k_z$ the dependence of the cutoff on $k_z$ is
important, and we have used a cutoff suggested by Sudb\ospace and Brandt. The
instabilities only occur for values of the anisotropy $\epsilon$ appropriate to
a material like BSCCO, and not for anisotropies more appropriate to YBCO. The
lower critical field $H_{c_1}(\phi)$ is calculated as a function of the angle

respect to each other assigning different values to the same physical
separation, the mixed metric tensor ${g^\mu}_\nu$ describing how gravitation

presented, where diffractive data are selected experimentally by demanding a
large gap in pseudo --rapidity around the proton remnant direction. The
transverse energy flow in the hadronic final state is evaluated using a set of
estimators which quantify topological properties. Using available Monte Carlo
QCD calculations, it is demonstrated that the final state in diffractive DIS
exhibits the features expected if the interaction is interpreted as the
scattering of an electron off a current quark with associated effects of
perturbative QCD. A model in which deep--inelastic diffraction is taken to be
the exchange of a pomeron with partonic structure is found to reproduce the
measurements well. Models for deep--inelastic $ep$ scattering, in which a
sizeable diffractive contribution is present because of non--perturbative

the quantum and/or thermal contributions to the effective potential seem to be
gauge-dependent, posing a problem for its physical interpretation. In this
paper, we identify the source of the problem and argue that in a Higgs theory,
perturbative contributions should be evaluated with the Higgs fields in the
polar basis, not in the Cartesian basis. Formally, this observation can be made
from the derivation of the Higgs theorem, which we provide. We show explicitly
that, properly defined, the effective action for the Abelian Higgs theory is
gauge invariant to all orders in perturbation expansion when evaluated in the
covariant gauge in the polar basis. In particular, the effective potential is
gauge invariant. We also show the equivalence between the calculations in the
covariant gauge in the polar basis and the unitary gauge. These points are
illustrated explicitly with the one-loop calculations of the effective action.
With a field redefinition, we obtain the physical effective potential. The
SU(2) non-Abelian case is also discussed.

to the dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity and

with higher-dimensional superstring theory, is suggested to explain the types
of gauge interactions that arise in the standard model based on the geometry of
the internal symmetry spaces. It is shown why a Lie group structure is required
for vector bosons in pure gauge theories and that the application of division
algebras to force unification must begin with the fermions comprising the
elementary particle multiplets of the standard model. A suggestion is made for
establishing a mechanism for the cancellation of anomalies within this approach

dominance method of Chemtob and Rho. For charged current reactions, exchange
current corrections can reduce the impulse approximation results by 5 to 10 \%

the total cross section for neutral current scattering by 20\% while exchange
