effects on their soft X-ray thermal emission. Our previous work had shown that,
due to gravitational lensing, dipolar fields cannot reproduce the strong
pulsations observed in Vela, Geminga, PSR 0656+14, and PSR 1055-52. Assuming a
standard neutron star mass of 1.4 Msol, we show here that the inclusion of a
quadrupolar component, if it is suitably oriented, is sufficient to increase
substantially the pulsed fraction, Pf, up to, or above, the observed values if
the stellar radius is 13 km or even 10 km. For models with a radius of 7 km the
maximum pulsed fraction obtainable with (isotropic) blackbody emission is of
the order of 15% for orthogonal rotators (Vela, Geminga and PSR 1055-52) and
only 5% for an inclined rotator as PSR 0656+14. Given the observed values this
indicates that the neutron stars in Geminga and PSR 0656+14 have radii
significantly larger than 7 km and, given the very specific quadrupole
components required to increase Pf, even radii of the order of 10 km may be
unlikely in all four cases.
  We confirm our previous finding that the pulsed fraction always increases
with photon energy, below about 1 keV, when blackbody emission is used and show
that it is due to the hardenning of the blackbody spectrum with increasing
temperature. The observed decrease of pulsed fraction may thus suggest that the
emitted spectrum softens with increasing temperature.
  Finally, we apply our model to reassess the magnetic field effect on the
outer boundary condition used in neutron star cooling models and show that, in
contradistinction to several previous claims, it is very small and most
probably results in a slight reduction of the heat flow through the envelope.

on $N$ (paths with one fixed point), a one-parameter group of functional
operators acting on tensor or spinor fields on $N$. The generator of this group
is a quadratic form in the Lie derivatives $\La_{X_{(\a)}}$ in the

  The basic functional integral is over $L^{2,1}$ paths $x: {\bf T} \ra N$

integrator is invariant under time translation, the integral is powerful enough
to be used for systems which are not time translation invariant. We give seven

new measurements of $M_W$ and $m_t$ at the Fermilab Tevatron as well as the
recent theoretical progress in the higher order radiative corrections. We will
discuss some of the hidden inputs and theoretical uncertainties involved in
making the predictions of the observables in the SM. From the minimal
$\chi^2$-fit to the experimental Z-decay parameters (with the aid of a modified
ZFITTER program) in a scheme where $M_Z$, $G_{\mu}$ and $\alpha (M_Z)$ are
taken as inputs, we can predict $M_W$ for given values of $m_H$ and $m_t$. The
current world average value of $M_W$ definitely favor nonvanishing electroweak
radiative corrections and is consistent with a heavy $m_t$ as measured by the
recent CDF report but with a heavy Higgs scalar of about 500 GeV within the
context of the minimal SM. The sensitivity of and the errors in the best fit
solutions due to the uncertainties in the gluonic coupling $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ and
$\alpha (M_Z)$ are examined carefully and any trace of new physics beyond the
SM implied by the data, in a particular $R_b$ and $R_c$, is also touched upon.
In addition we discuss how the future precision measurements of $M_W$ and $Z$
decay parameters can determine the Higgs boson mass and distinguish the SM with
radiative corrections from the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) and
other extended model.

fields' defined as fields with large vacuum expectation values (vevs) and
almost flat potentials. If a flaton field is trapped at the origin in the early
universe, one expects `thermal inflation' to take place before it rolls away to
the true vacuum, because the finite-temperature correction to the potential
will hold it at the origin until the temperature falls below $1\TeV$ or so. In
the first part of the paper, that expectation is confirmed by an estimate of
the finite temperature corrections and of the tunneling rate to the true
vacuum, paying careful attention to the validity of the approximations that are
used. The second part of the paper considers topological defects which may be
produced at the end of an era of thermal inflation. If the flaton fields
associated with the era are GUT higgs fields, then its end corresponds to the
GUT phase transition. In that case monopoles (as well as GUT higgs particles)
will have to be diluted by a second era of thermal inflation. Such an era will
not affect the cosmology of GUT strings, for which the crucial parameter is the
string mass per unit length. Because of the flat Higgs potential, the GUT
symmetry breaking scale required for the strings to be a candidate for the
origin of large scale structure and the cmb anisotropy is about three times
bigger than usual, but given the uncertainties it is still compatible with the
one required by the unification of the Standard Model gauge couplings. The
cosmology of textures and of global monopoles is unaffected by the flatness of
the potential.

infinite matrix solutions to the Toda lattice hierarchy. Using an operator
transformation we convert some of these into solutions in terms of integral
operators and Fredholm determinants. Others are converted into a class of
operator solutions to the $l$-periodic Toda hierarchy.
