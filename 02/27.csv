intersect successive members of of a fixed flag of isotropic subbundles of V in
dimensions greater than 1,2,3,... . The formulas which we give are quadratic
expressions in Q-polynomials of the tautological bundle on G and flag
S-polynomials of the members of the flag. These formulas globalize to
Lagrangian and orthogonal degeneracy loci. They have especially nice form for
the loci of points in X where two maximal isotropic subbundles intersect in
dimension exceeding a given number. (A problem for finding formulas for these
loci was posed by J. Harris several years ago.) In this case, our formulas are
simple quadratic expressions of Q-polynomials applied to E and F. The work
generalizes formulas given in [P.Pragacz, Algebro- geometric applications of

detailed stellar models and of revised rates for 15N(a,g)19F and 18O(a,g)22Ne.
These calculations confirm an early expectation that 19F {\it is} produced in
AGB thermal pulses. They also enlarge substantially these previous results by
showing that the variations of the level of 19F production during the evolution
is very sensitive to the maximum temperature reached at the base of the pulse.
These variations are analyzed in detail, and are shown to result from a subtle
balance between different nuclear effects (mainly 19F production or destruction
in a pulse, and 15N synthesis during the interpulse), possibly super-imposed on
dilution effects in more or less extended pulse convective tongues. Our
calculations, as most others, do not predict the third dredge-up self-
consistently. When parametrized, it appears that our models of
intermediate-mass AGB stars are able to account only for the lowest 19F
overabundances observed in solar-metallicity MS, S and C stars. That conclusion
is expected to hold true for low-mass stars when F production results from
secondary 13C only. Massive AGB stars, on the other hand, are not expected to
build up large surface F abundanc- es. Therefore, the large F overabundance
reported for the super Li-rich star WZ Cas (where HBB is supposed to be
operating) remains unexplained so far. Our results for the (M=3,Z=0.001) star
indicate that F surface overabundances can also be expected in low-metallicity

relative increase in the surface 19F/12C ratio is, however, lower in the
low-metallicity than in the solar-metallicity star. No observations are

violates the local positive energy conditions of general relativity. However,
<T_{ab}> may satisfy some nonlocal conditions such as the averaged null energy
condition (ANEC), which would rule out traversable wormholes. Although ANEC
holds in Minkowski spacetime, it can be violated in curved spacetimes if one is
allowed to choose the spacetime and quantum state arbitrarily, without
imposition of the semiclassical Einstein equation G_{ab} = 8 \pi <T_{ab}>. In
this paper we investigate whether ANEC holds for solutions to this equation, by
studying a free, massless scalar field with arbitrary curvature coupling in
perturbation theory to second order about the flat spacetime/vacuum solution.
We ""reduce the order"" of the perturbation equations to eliminate spurious
solutions, and consider the limit in which the lengthscales determined by the
incoming state are much larger than the Planck length. We also need to assume
that incoming classical gravitational radiation does not dominate the first
order metric perturbation. We find that although the ANEC integral can be
negative, if we average the ANEC integral transverse to the geodesic with a
suitable Planck scale smearing function, then a strictly positive result is
obtained in all cases except for the flat spacetime/vacuum solution. This
result suggests --- in agreement with conclusions drawn by Ford and Roman from
entirely independent arguments --- that if traversable wormholes do exist as
solutions to the semiclassical equations, they cannot be macroscopic but must
be ``Planck scale''. A large portion of our paper is devoted to the analysis of
general issues concerning the nature of the semiclassical Einstein equation and
of prescriptions for extracting physically relevant solutions.

measurements at microwave frequencies. The vortex response is dominated by
viscous flux flow, indicative of extremely weak pinning, and is parametrized by
a field scale H_{c2,eff}. The angular dependence of the vortex contribution
\lambda(\theta) is in good agreement with the Coffey-Clem model. Structure is
seen in the depairing transition in the vicinity of the upper critical field,
with the existence of well-defined critical fields H_{c2a}, H_{c2b} and
H_{c2c}, with the vortex field scale H_{c2,eff} closest to H_{c2b}. Overall the
measurements indicate that YNi_2B_2C has a rich and unusual field dependence of
its transport parameters.
