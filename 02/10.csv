found in the inner regions of early-type galaxies, we evaluate their effect to
stellar absorption-line indices. We derive analytical expressions for changes
induced by the presence of nebular emission lines, both for atomic and
molecular absorption-line indices.
  We find that the [NI] emission-line doublet at 5199 A can significantly
affect Mgb line-strength measurements. For typical equivalent widths of the
[NI] doublet in nuclei of early-type galaxies featuring nebular emission, the
Mgb index is artificially enhanced by 0.4 - 2 A, which represents a significant
fraction of the typical equivalent width of the Mgb line in early-type
galaxies.
  We illustrate this effect in the case of NGC 2974.

spectra obtained from multinarrowband imagery, a technique for multi-object
spectrophotometry. Comparing the cross-correlation with the breakfinder, we
find that neither is intrinsically superior to the other. They have comparable
precision for early type galaxies but the cross-correlation is clearly superior
for later type galaxies. On the other hand, unlike the breakfinder, the
cross-correlation is sensitive to instrumental errors as well as the shape of
the templates used. We carried out simulations with two types of global
spectral errors: a slope error and sinusoidal errors. They can introduce
serious systematic errors in redshifts measured with the cross-correlation. The
breakfinder is a spectrally local test and does not suffer from this type of
error. We therefore conclude that the two techniques are complementary and that
they should both be used to help flag objects for which they give abnormally
discrepant redshifts.

chemical evolution, while simple (it is burned to $^3$He), is intertwined with
the more complicated evolution of $^3$He. Gloeckler \& Geiss' new measurement
of the $^3$He abundance and the HST measurement of D, both in the local ISM
today, can be compared to the pre-solar nebula abundances of D and $^3$He.
Within the uncertainties, the sum of D + $^3$He relative to hydrogen is
unchanged. This provides some validation of the cosmological utility of D +
$^3$He, first suggested by Yang et al (1984), and further, indicates that over
the past 4.5 Gyr there has been at most modest stellar production of $^3$He, in
contradiction with stellar modeling, or modest stellar destruction of $^3$He,
in contradiction with some ``solar spoons.'' While the earlier Galactic
evolution of D + $^3$He cannot be constrained directly, it is expected to be
dominated by massive stars, which deplete their $^3$He and produce metals.
Based on the Galactic metallicity and the constancy of D + $^3$He over the past
4.5 Gyr, we derive a more empirically based lower bound to the cosmological
baryon density; while not dramatically different from the original bound of
Yang et al (1984) based on D + $^3$He, it alleviates some of the cosmic tension
between the big-bang $^4$He abundance and those of D and $^3$He.

burning stars) and then extrapolate to place limits on the total mass of halo
brown dwarfs (stars not quite massive enough to burn hydrogen). The mass
functions are obtained from the luminosity function of a sample of 114 local
halo stars in the USNO parallax survey (Dahn \etal 1995). We use stellar models
of Alexander \etal (1996) and make varying assumptions about metallicity and
about possible unresolved binaries in the sample. We find that the MF for halo
red dwarfs cannot rise more quickly than $1/m^2$ as one approaches the hydrogen
burning limit. Using recent results from star formation theory, we extrapolate
the MF into the brown-dwarf regime. We see that likely extrapolations imply
that the total mass of brown dwarfs in the halo is less than $\sim 3\%$ of the
local mass density of the halo ($\sim 0.3\%$ for the more realistic models we
consider). Our limits apply to brown dwarfs in the halo that come from the same
stellar population as the red dwarfs.

threshold, then hierarchical clustering theories for structure formation
predict its autocorrelation function to be determined purely by the cluster
abundance and by the spectrum of linear density fluctuations. Thus if the shape
of the initial fluctuation spectrum is known, its amplitude $\sigma_8$ can be
estimated directly from the correlation length of a cluster sample in a way
which is independent of the value of $\Omega_0$. If the cluster mass
corresponding to the sample threshold is also known, it provides an independent
estimate of the quantity $\sigma_8\Omega_0^{0.6}$. Thus cluster data should
allow both $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_0$ to be determined observationally. We
explore these questions using N-body simulations together with a simple but
accurate analytical model based on extensions of Press-Schechter theory.
Applying our results to currently available data we find that if the linear
fluctuation spectrum has a shape similar to that suggested by the APM galaxy
survey, then a correlation length $r_0$ in excess of $20\mpch$ for Abell
clusters would require $\sigma_8>1$, while $r_0<15\mpch$ would require
$\sigma_8<0.5$. With conventional estimates of the relevant mass threshold
these imply $\Omega_0\la 0.3$ and $\Omega_0\ga 1$ respectively.
