distinct peaks, and can be decomposed into a fast-rotating component with
v/sigma > 3, and a slower rotating, retrograde component with v/sigma between 1

follows that of the bulge, obtained from a 2-dimensional bulge-disk
decomposition of a near-infrared K-band image, while the fast rotating
component follows the disk. At the radius where the disk starts to dominate the
isophotes change from being considerably boxy to very disky.
  Although a number of spiral galaxies have been found that contain cold,
couter-rotating disks, this is the first galaxy known to have a boxy, probably
triaxial, fairly warm, counter-rotating component, which is dominating in the
central regions. If it is a bar seen end-on, this bar has to be thicker than
the disk. We find that NGC 7331, even though it is a fairly early-type spiral,
does not have a conventional, co-rotating bulge. The fact that the inner
component is retrograde makes us believe that it was formed from infalling
material, in either stellar or gaseous form (e.g. Balcells & Quinn 1990).
Another possibility however is that the structure has been there since the
formation of the galaxy. In this case it will be a challenge to explain the
large change in orientation of the angular momentum when going outward
radially.

Cartan's symmetric spaces of type C, CI, D, and DIII. A detailed study is made
of the systems where the phase shift due to Andreev reflection averages to zero
along a typical semiclassical single-electron trajectory. Such systems are
particularly interesting because they do not have a genuine excitation gap but
support quasiparticle states close to the chemical potential. Disorder or
dynamically generated chaos mixes the states and produces novel forms of
universal level statistics. For two of the four universality classes, the
n-level correlation functions are calculated by the mapping on a free 1D Fermi

fluctuations are computed from a maximum-entropy S-matrix ensemble. They are
larger by a factor of two than what is naively expected from the analogy with

number of slow modes: owing to the coupling of particles and holes by the
proximity to the superconductor, every cooperon and diffuson mode in the

channels $(A_{1g})$. Particular emphasis is placed on screening in bilayer
superconductors. Since any charge fluctuation with long range character in real
space is screened by the Coulomb interaction, the relevant fluctuations in a
single layer case are induced between different parts of the Fermi surface. In
a single band $d$-wave superconductor the scattering at energy transfer twice
the maximum gap $\Delta_{max}$ is dominated by those parts of the Fermi surface
where $\Delta^2({\bf k})$ is largest. As a consequence, the fully symmetric
($A_{1g}$) scattering is screened. In the case of a bilayer superconductor
however, the charge transfer is possible between layers inside the unit cell.
Therefore a formalism is considered which is valid for general band structure,
superconducting energy gaps, and inter-layer hopping matrix elements. The
spectra is calculated for La 2:1:4 and Y 1:2:3 as representative single and
bilayer superconductors. The mixing term is found to be negligible and thus the
response is well approximated by the sum of the contributions from the
individual bands. The theory imposes strong constraints on both the magnitude

  Here a new tool to restrict their continuous deformations is presented:
Classifying spaces for homogeneous manifolds and their related Lie isometry
deformations.
  The adjoint representation of n-dimensional real Lie algebras induces a
natural topology on their classifying space, which encodes the natural
algebraic relationship between different Lie algebras therein. For n>1 this
topology is not Hausdorffian. Even more it satisfies only the separation axiom
T_0, but not T_1, i.e. there is a constant sequence which has a limit different
from the members of the sequence. Such a limit is called a transition.
  Recently it was found that transitions are the natural generalization and
transitive completion of the well-known In\""on\""u-Wigner contractions. For n<5
the relational classifying spaces are constructed explicitly.
  Calculating their characteristic scalar invariants via triad representations
of the characteristic isometry, local homogeneous Riemannian 3-spaces are
classified in their natural geometrical relations to each other. Their
classifying space is a composition of pieces with different isometry types.
Although it is Hausdorffian, different topological transitions to the same
limit may induce locally non-Euclidean regions (e.g. at Bianchi tppes VII_0).

neighboring flux-tubes. We formulate the system of multi color-flux -tubes by
regarding it as the system of two color-flux-tubes penetrating through a two
dimensional sphere surface. We find the multi flux-tube configuration becomes
uniform above some critical flux-tube number density $\rho_c = 1.3 \sim 1.7
{\rm fm}^{-2}$. On the other hand, the inhomogeneity on the color electric
distribution appears when the flux-tube density is smaller than $\rho_c$. We
discuss the relation between the inhomogeneity in the color-electric
distribution and the flux-tube number density in the multi-flux-tube system
created during the QGP formation process in the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion
collision.

level $k$ (an integer) added, has two dimensionful coupling constants, $g^2 k$
and $g^2 N$; its possible phases depend on the size of $k$ relative to $N$. For
$k \gg N$, this theory approaches topological Chern-Simons theory with no
Yang-Mills term, and expectation values of multiple Wilson loops yield Jones
polynomials, as Witten has shown; it can be treated semiclassically. For $k=0$,
the theory is badly infrared singular in perturbation theory, a
non-perturbative mass and subsequent quantum solitons are generated, and Wilson
loops show an area law. We argue that there is a phase transition between these
two behaviors at a critical value of $k$, called $k_c$, with $k_c/N \approx 2
\pm .7$. Three lines of evidence are given: First, a gauge-invariant one-loop
calculation shows that the perturbative theory has tachyonic problems if $k
\leq 29N/12$.The theory becomes sensible only if there is an additional dynamic
source of gauge-boson mass, just as in the $k=0$ case. Second, we study in a
rough approximation the free energy and show that for $k \leq k_c$ there is a
non-trivial vacuum condensate driven by soliton entropy and driving a
gauge-boson dynamical mass $M$, while both the condensate and $M$ vanish for $k
\geq k_c$. Third, we study possible quantum solitons stemming from an effective
action having both a Chern-Simons mass $m$ and a (gauge-invariant) dynamical
mass $M$. We show that if $M \gsim 0.5 m$, there are finite-action quantum
sphalerons, while none survive in the classical limit $M=0$, as shown earlier
by D'Hoker and Vinet. There are also quantum topological vortices smoothly
vanishing as $M \rightarrow 0$.

the exact deformations of the standard R-matrix and the associated Hopf
algebras. They are described as a generalized twist, $ R_\epsilon =
(F^t)^{-1}RF$, where $R$ is the standard R-matrix and $F$ (a power series in
the deformation parameter $\epsilon$) is the solution of a linear recursion
relation of the same type as that which determines $R$. Specializing again, to
the case of quantized, affine Kac-Moody algebras, and taking the classical
limit of these esoteric quantum groups, one re-discovers the esoteric affine
r-matrices of Belavin and Drinfeld, including the elliptic ones. The formulas
obtained here are easier to use than the original ones, and the structure of
the space of classical r-matrices (for simple Lie algebras) is more tranparent.
In addition, the r-matrices obtained here are more general in that they are
