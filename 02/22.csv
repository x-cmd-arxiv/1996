modest component of this problem: we seek non-axisymmetric razor-thin discs of
two-dimensional barotropic fluid that are stationary in an inertial frame. We
distinguish between `razor-thin' and `two-dimensional,' applying the latter
term to the equation of state. Furthermore we assume that our systems are
scale-free, which reduces the partial differential equations describing the

computed. The distortion is supposed to be symmetric around some axis inclined
with respect to the rotation axis. In the general case, the gravitational
radiation is emitted at two frequencies: $\Omega$ and $2\Omega$, where $\Omega$
is the rotation frequency. The obtained formul\ae\ are applied to the specific
case of a neutron star distorted by its own magnetic field. Assuming that the
period derivative $\dot P$ of pulsars is a measure of their magnetic dipole
moment, the gravitational wave amplitude can be related to the observable
parameters $P$ and $\dot P$ and to a factor $\beta$ which measures the
efficiency of a given magnetic dipole moment in distorting the star. $\beta$
depends on the nuclear matter equation of state and on the magnetic field
distribution. The amplitude at the frequency $2\Omega$, expressed in terms of
$P$, $\dot P$ and $\beta$, is independent of the angle $\alpha$ between the
magnetic axis and the rotation axis, whereas at the frequency $\Omega$, the
amplitude increases as $\alpha$ decreases. The value of $\beta$ for specific
models of magnetic field distributions has been computed by means of a
numerical code giving self-consistent models of magnetized neutron stars within
general relativity. It is found that the distortion at fixed magnetic dipole
moment is very dependent of the magnetic field distribution; a stochastic
magnetic field or a superconductor stellar interior greatly increases $\beta$
with respect to the uniformly magnetized perfect conductor case and might lead
to gravitational waves detectable by the VIRGO or LIGO interferometers. The
amplitude modulation of the signal induced by the daily rotation of the Earth

detailed description of the evolution of hierarchical clustering, including a
complete description of the merger history tree. The relation to branching
process epidemic models means that the Press--Schechter description can also be
understood using the formalism developed in the study of queues. The queueing
theory formalism, also, is used to provide a complete description of the merger
history of any given Press--Schechter clump. In particular, an analytic
expression for the merger history of any given Poisson Press--Schechter clump
is obtained. This expression allows one to calculate the partition function of
merger history trees. It obeys an interesting scaling relation; the partition
function for a given pair of initial and final epochs is the same as that for
certain other pairs of initial and final epochs.
  The distribution function of counts in randomly placed cells, as a function
of time, is also obtained using the branching process and queueing theory
descriptions. Thus, the Press--Schechter description of the gravitational

luminosity of variable AGN seen by EGRET is investigated. We performed
Monte-Carlo simulations of typical data sets and applied different correlation
techniques (partial correlation analysis, $\chi^2$-test applied on flux-flux
relations) in view of a truncation bias caused by sensitivity limits of the
surveys. For K-corrected flux densities, we find that with the least squares
method only a linear correlation can be recovered. Partial correlation analysis
on the other side provides a robust tool to detect correlations even in
flux-limited samples if intrinsic scatter does not exceed $\sim 40$ \% of the
original $\gamma$-ray luminosity. The analysis presented in this paper takes
into account redshift bias and truncation effects simultaneously which was
never considered in earlier papers.
  Applying this analysis to simultaneously observed radio- and $\gamma$-ray
data, no correlation is found. However, an artificial correlation appears when
using the mean flux. This is probably due to the reduction of the dynamical
range in the flux-flux relation. Furthermore, we show that comparing the
emission in both spectral bands at a high activity state leads to no convincing
correlation.
  In conclusion, we can not confirm a correlation between radio and
$\gamma$-ray luminosities of AGN which is claimed in previous works.

propagator rather than the short-range part, which means monopole dominance for
D$\chi $SB. Second, the correlation between instantons and QCD-monopoles is
studied. In the Polyakov-like gauge, where $A_4(x)$ is diagonalized, the
QCD-monopole trajectory penetrates the center of each instanton, and becomes
complicated in the multi-instanton system. Finally, using the SU(2) lattice
gauge theory with $16^4$ and $16^3 \times 4$, the instanton number is measured
in the singular (monopole-dominating) and regular (photon-dominating) sectors,

k_1=k(a_0) of k, where a_0=sqrt(B_0) for a certain B_0 in
k^\times/(k^\times)^2. In this paper, we consider the zeta function defined for
the space of pairs of binary Hermitian forms. This is the prehomogeneous vector
space we discussed in section 2 [1] and is a non-split form of the D_4 case in
[4].
  The purpose of this paper is to determine the principal part of the adjusted
zeta function. Our main result is Theorem (8.15). Our case resembles the space
of pairs of binary quadratic forms which we discussed in Chapter 5 [5].
However, the meaning of the problem, the pole structure of the adjusted zeta
function, and the adjusting terms are different from those of the above case.
The zeta function of our case is a counting function of the class number times
the regulator of fields of the form k(sqrt(B_0),sqrt(B)) with B_0 fixed and B
in k_, whereas the zeta function for the above case is essentially the same as
the space of binary quadratic forms. Our case is a first example where we need
two adjusting terms whereas the adjusting term of the above case was
essentially the same as that of the space of binary quadratic forms. We will
not prove the meromorphic continuation of the adjusting terms in this paper.
For the sake of the density theorem, we still get the residue of the rightmost
pole of the zeta function (without adjusting). If this space appears in a
bigger prehomogeneous vector space. So the principal part formula of the
adjusted zeta function should be enough for most applications. We have yet to
obtain the corresponding density theorem because we have not carried out the
local theory.

reveal the remarkable persistence of a weakly damped high-frequency ion

providing a probe for the metal-insulator transition in a region of parameters
