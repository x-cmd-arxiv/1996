from the fact that a unitary impurity produces a marginally-bound state at zero

Consequently, for finite density of impurities, the impurity-induced states are
coupled by long-range overlaps yielding extended quasiparticle states below a

$\omega_c \propto e^{-c/n_{\rm imp}}$, where $n_{\rm imp}$ is the impurity

in the three-nucleon system. For the medium-mass region (A=15--41) the
binding-energy differences of mirror nuclei are computed using a relativistic
mean-field approximation to the Walecka model. We obtain large binding-energy
differences---of the order of several hundred keV---arising from the
pseudoscalar sector. Two effects are primarily responsible for this new
finding: a) the inclusion of isospin breaking in the pion-nucleon coupling
constant, and b) the in-medium enhancement of the small components of the
bound-state wave functions. We look for off-shell ambiguities in these results
and find them to be large.

theories is defined, and a careful study of its behavior for vanishing
cosmological constant is performed. This allows an exhaustive description of
the unframed knot invariants coming from the pure BF theory based on SU(2), and
in particular, it proves a conjecture relating them to the Alexander-Conway
polynomial.

with the two-parametric $(p,q)$-Alexander-Conway solution $(R)$ of the
Yang-Baxter equation are studied. Using the Hopf duality construction, the full
Hopf structure of the quasitriangular enveloping algebra $U_{p,q}(R)$ is
extracted. The universal ${\cal T}$-matrix for $Fun_{p,q}(R)$ is derived. While
expressing an arbitrary group element of the quantum group characterized by the
noncommuting parameters in a representation independent way, the ${\cal
T}$-matrix generalizes the familiar exponential relation between a Lie group
and its Lie algebra. The universal ${\cal R}$-matrix and the FRT matrix
generators, $L^{(\pm )}$, for $U_{p,q}(R)$ are derived from the ${\cal
T}$-matrix.

properties like completeness and integrability are discused for the general
case.
