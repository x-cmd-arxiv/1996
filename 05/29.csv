is introduced that is rooted in automata theory but avoids the problems of
Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity. This physical complexity can be estimated for
ensembles of sequences, for which it reverts to the difference between the
maximal entropy of the ensemble and the actual entropy given the specific
environment within which the sequence is to be interpreted. Thus, the physical
complexity measures the amount of information about the environment that is
coded in the sequence, and is conditional on such an environment. In practice,
an estimate of the complexity of a string can be obtained by counting the
number of loci per string that are fixed in the ensemble, while the volatile
positions represent, again with respect to the environment, randomness. We
apply this measure to tRNA sequence data.

this formalism to the problem of gravitational lensing by cosmic string loops.
In particular, we find an analytic solution for the special case of a circular
loop perpendicular to the optical axis. As examples of more complicated loops,
we consider two loops with higher frequency Fourier modes. The numerical
analysis illustrates the general features of loop lenses. Our estimates, using
typical parameters for GUT scale loops, show that the stringy nature of loop
lenses can be observed for lensing systems involving high redshift galaxies ($z

correlation tests, we searched for correlations of the absorption strengths,
saturation, and line-of-sight kinematics with the galaxy redshifts, rest frame
B and K luminosities, rest <B-K> colors, and impact parameters D. We found no
correlations at the 2.5-sigma level between these properties. Of primary
significance is the fact that the QSO-galaxy impact parameter apparently does
not provide the primary distinguishing factor by which absorption properties
can be characterized. The galaxy absorption properties exhibit a large scatter,
which, we argue, is suggestive of a picture in which the gas arises from a
variety of on-going dynamical events. Inferences from our study include: (1)
The spatial distribution of absorbing gas in galaxies does not appear to follow
a simple galactocentric functional dependence. (2) A single systematic
kinematic model apparently cannot describe the observed velocity spreads in the
absorbing gas. It is more that a heterogeneous population of sub-galaxy scale
structures are giving rise to the observed cloud velocities. (3) The absorbing
gas spatial distribution and kinematics may depend upon gas producing events
and mechanisms that are recent to the epoch at which the absorption is
observed. These distributions likely change over a few Gyr timescale. Based
upon these inferences, we note that any evolution in the absorption gas
properties over a larger redshift range should be directly quantifiable from a
larger dataset of high-resolution absorption profiles.

properly and that their accuracy was comparable to that expected for a
photometry based on photographic transfers. This result is also substantiated
by comparison with the re-calibration of some Asiago sequences made

determined and B magnitudes and (B-V) colors at light peak derived. With the
new data the color distribution of the SNe studied here becomes narrower and
moves to the red by only 0.06 mag, showing no more very blue objects except for
one, still uncertain, case. As far as the use of SNIa as standard candles is

are sensitive to finite lattice artifacts. From analyses of low-temperature
series expansions for $3 \le q \le 8$, we establish the existence, in this

susceptibility diverge. From calculations of zeros of the partition function,
we obtain evidence consistent with the inference that these singularities occur

independence in QED. As the first candidate take the LSZ-asymptotic states in a
covariant canonical formalism to investigate gauge independence of the
(Belinfante's) symmetric energy-momentum tensor. It is shown that expectation
values of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of those asymptotic states are
gauge independent to all orders. Second, consider gauge invariant operators of
electron or photon, such as the Dirac's electron or Steinmann's covariant
approach, expecting a gauge invariant result without any restriction. It is,
however, demonstrated that to single out gauge invariant quantities is merely
synonymous to a gauge fixing, resulting again in use of the asymptotic
condition when proving gauge independence. Nevertheless, it is commented that
these invariant approaches is helpful to understand the mechanism of the
LSZ-mapping and furthermore of quark confinement in QCD. As the final
candidate, it is shown that gauge transformations are freely performed under
the functional representation or the path integral expression on account of the
fact that the functional space is equivalent to a collection of infinitely many
inequivalent Fock spaces. The covariant LSZ formalism is shortly reviewed and
the basic facts on the energy-momentum tensor are also illustrated.

investigated in $4$-dimensional ultrastatic space-time $ R \times H^3/\Gamma$,
$H^3/\Gamma$ being a non-compact hyperbolic manifold with finite volume. Making
use of the Selberg trace formula, the $\zeta$-function related to the small
disturbance operator is constructed. For an arbitrary gravitational coupling,
it is found that $\zeta(s)$ has a simple pole at $s=0$. The one-loop effective
action is analysed by means of proper-time regularisations and the one-loop
divergences are explicitly found. It is pointed out that, in this special case,
also $\zeta$-function regularisation requires a divergent counterterm, which
however is not necessary in the free massless conformal invariant coupling
case. Finite temperature effects are studied and the high-temperature expansion
is presented. A possible application to the problem of the divergences of the
entanglement entropy for a free massless scalar field in a Rindler-like
space-time is briefly discussed.

  translation to appear in St. Petersburg Math. J. 9 (1998), no. 2",,,"q-alg math.QA",,"  The classical algebra $\Lambda$ of symmetric functions has a remarkable
deformation $\Lambda^*$, which we call the algebra of shifted symmetric
functions. In the latter algebra, there is a distinguished basis formed by
shifted Schur functions $s^*_\mu$, where $\mu$ ranges over the set of all
partitions. The main significance of the shifted Schur functions is that they
determine a natural basis in $Z(\frak{gl}(n))$, the center of the universal
enveloping algebra $U(\frak{gl}(n))$, $n=1,2,\ldots$.
  The functions $s^*_\mu$ are closely related to the factorial Schur functions
introduced by Biedenharn and Louck and further studied by Macdonald and other
authors.
  A part of our results about the functions $s^*_\mu$ has natural classical
analogues (combinatorial presentation, generating series, Jacobi--Trudi
identity, Pieri formula). Other results are of different nature (connection
with the binomial formula for characters of $GL(n)$, an explicit expression for
the dimension of skew shapes $\lambda/\mu$, Capelli--type identities, a
characterization of the functions $s^*_\mu$ by their vanishing properties,
`coherence property', special symmetrization map $S(\frak{gl}(n))\to
U(\frak{gl}(n))$.
  The main application that we have in mind is the asymptotic character theory
for the unitary groups $U(n)$ and symmetric groups $S(n)$ as $n\to\infty$.
  The results of this paper were used in \cite{Ok1--3}.

description of entanglement. It parallels classical (Shannon) information
theory but is based entirely on density matrices (rather than probability
distributions) for the description of quantum ensembles. We find that quantum
conditional entropies can be negative for entangled systems, which leads to a
violation of well-known bounds in Shannon information theory. Such a unified
information-theoretic description of classical correlation and quantum
entanglement clarifies the link between them: the latter can be viewed as
``super-correlation'' which can induce classical correlation when considering a
tripartite or larger system. Furthermore, negative entropy and the associated
clarification of entanglement paves the way to a natural information-theoretic
description of the measurement process. This model, while unitary and causal,
implies the well-known probabilistic results of conventional quantum mechanics.
It also results in a simple interpretation of the Kholevo theorem limiting the
accessible information in a quantum measurement.
