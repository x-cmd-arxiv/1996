  Publications vol 36 (1996) AMSTEX",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  The goal of the paper is two-fold. At first, we attempt to give a survey of
some recent applications of symmetric polynomials and divided differences to
intersection theory. We discuss: polynomials universally supported on
degeneracy loci; some explicit formulas for the Chern and Segre classes of
Schur bundles with applications to enumerative geometry; flag degeneracy loci;
fundamental classes, diagonals and Gysin maps; intersection rings of G/P and
formulas for isotropic degeneracy loci; numerically positive polynomials for
ample vector bundles.
  Apart of surveyed results, the paper contains also some new results as well
as some new proofs of earlier ones: how to compute the fundamental class of a
subvariety from the class of the diagonal of the ambient space; how to compute
the class of the relative diagonal using Gysin maps; a new formula for pushing
forward Schur's Q- polynomials in Grassmannian bundles; a new formula for the
total Chern class of a Schur bundle; another proof of Schubert's and
Giambelli's enumeration of complete quadrics; an operator proof of the
Jacobi-Trudi formula; a Schur complex proof of the Giambelli-Thom-Porteous
formula.

measurements of CP violation is the difference of the transition probabilities
between CP-conjugate channels. In those experiments, the CP violating effect is
not suppressed if the highest neutrino mass scale is taken to be $1\sim 5 \eV$,
which is appropriate for the cosmological hot dark matter. Assuming the
hierarchy for the neutrino masses, the upper bounds of CP violation have been
caluculated for three cases, in which mixings are constrained by the recent
short baseline ones. The calculated upper bounds are larger than $10^{-2}$,
which will be observable in the long baseline accelerator experiments. The
matter effect, which is not CP invariant, has been also estimated in those
