adiabatic collapse, or equivalently, a significant decrease in the effective
speed of sound during the color-confinement transition. Our considerations
imply that for generic initial density perturbation spectra PBH mass functions
are expected to exhibit a pronounced peak on the QCD-horizon mass scale $\sim 1
M_{\odot}$. This mass scale is roughly coincident with the estimated masses for
compact objects recently observed in our galactic halo by the MACHO

the paradox---since such first-order solutions must always have singular lines
in space for all sufficiently large values of $r$---by showing that if we
perturbatively iterate the solution up to the third order in small quantities,
there are acceptable regular solutions. That these solutions become flat before

finite result is obtained in terms of powers of logarithms (describing the
zero-threshold singularity) times power series in the momentum squared.
Surprisingly, these latter ones represent functions, which not only have the
expected physical `second threshold' but have a branchcut singularity as well
below threshold at a mirror position. These can be understood as
pseudothresholds corresponding to solutions of the Landau equations. In the
spacelike region the imaginary parts from the various contributions cancel. For
the two-loop examples with one mass $M$, in the timelike region for $q^2
\approx M^2$ we obtain approximations of high precision. This will be of

total width and $\mupmum$ coupling of a SM-like Higgs boson with mass $\lsim
2\mw$ (as particularly relevant to supersymmetric/GUT models) can be directly
measured with substantial precision. Multiplication of measured branching
ratios by the total width yields the corresponding couplings. As a result, the
light CP-even SM-like Higgs of the minimal supersymmetric model can be
distinguished from the Higgs of the minimal Standard Model over a larger
