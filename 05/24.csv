of the high-energy \gr source 2EG J1746-2852. The observed \gr flux is constant
within the statistical limits and the spectrum is very hard. The lack of
variability makes it highly unlikely that any of the compact sources in the
vicinity of the Galactic Center is the counterpart of 2EG J1746-2852. This
includes the peculiar source Sgr A$^\ast$ at the very center of the Galaxy,
which is often discussed to harbour a black hole of $10^6\, M_\odot$. Existing
radio data on the {\it arc} support the view that its synchrotron emission
originates from cooling, initially monoenergetic electrons which diffuse and
convect from their sources to the outer extensions of the {\it arc}. If the
source of high-energy electrons coincides with the sickle region (G0.18-0.04),
as indicated by the radio data, then the ambient far- infrared photons can be
up-scattered to \grs by inverse-Compton inter- action with the young
high-energy electrons. We solve the continuity equation for the electrons
including terms for diffusion, convection, monoenergetic injection, and the
full energy loss. We show that both the flux and the spectrum of 2EG J1746-2852
can be well explained.

giving a possibility for the existence of ergodic measures and dynamical

$\beta = d \log \lambda / d \log E $ of the principal Lyapunov exponent with
the energy of the lattice system. A large body of recent literature claims a
linear scaling relationship ($\beta = 1$) between the principal Lyapunov

of the lattice Yang-Mills equations. We question this result by providing
rigorous upper bounds on the Lyapunov exponent for all energies, hence giving a
non-positive exponent, $\beta \leq 0$, asymptotically for high energies, and we
give plausible arguments for a scaling exponent close to $\beta \sim 1/4$ for
low energies. We argue that the region of low energy is the region which comes

determine the number of iterations necessary to achieve almost certainty of
finding the answer. Furthermore, we analyse the behaviour of the algorithm when
the element to be found appears more than once in the table and we provide a
new algorithm to find such an element even when the number of solutions is not
known ahead of time. Using techniques from Shor's quantum factoring algorithm
in addition to Grover's approach, we introduce a new technique for approximate
quantum counting, which allows to estimate the number of solutions. Finally we
provide a lower bound on the efficiency of any possible quantum database
searching algorithm and we show that Grover's algorithm nearly comes within a
factor 2 of being optimal in terms of the number of probes required in the
table.

This
circuit makes teleportation straightforward to anyone who believes that quantum
computation is a reasonable proposition. It could also be genuinely used inside
a quantum computer if teleportation is needed to move quantum information
around. An unusual feature of this circuit is that there are points in the
computation at which the quantum information can be completely disrupted by a
measurement (or some types of interaction with the environment) without ill
effects: the same final result is obtained whether or not these measurements
takes place.
