the gravitational lensing effect of the foreground cluster, and the unlensed

in the classical ring galaxy VIIZw466 and its immediate surroundings. The HI
gas corresponding to the bright optical star forming ring exhibits the typical
profile of a rotating-expanding ring. The systemic velocity of the galaxy is
found to be 14,468km/s. A formal fit to the HI kinematics in the ring is
consistent with both ring rotation and expansion (expansion velocity 32 km/s).
However, H\,I in the northeast quadrant of the ring is severely disturbed,
showing evidence of tidal interaction. We also detect a hydrogen plume from the
southern edge-on companion galaxy (G2) pointing towards the ring galaxy. This,
and other peculiarities associated with G2 suggest that it is the intruder
galaxy which recently collided with VIIZw466 and formed the ring. Numerical
hydrodynamic models are presented which show that most of the observed features
can be accounted for as a result of the impact splash between two gas disks.
The resultant debris is stretched by ring wave motion in the bridge and later
forms accretion streams onto the two galaxies.Finally, we detect HI emission
from two previously unknown dwarf galaxies located northeast and southeast of
VIIZw466 respectively. This brings the total number of members of the VIIZw466
group to five. Using the projected mass method, the upper limit of the
dynamical mass of the group was estimated to be Mo =3.5x10^{12} M_sun, which
implies that the mass to light ratio of the group is (M/L)_{group} \approx$ 70.
This rather low value of M/L, as compared with other loose groups, suggests the
group may be in a state of collapse at the present time. Plunging orbits would
naturally lead to an enhanced probability of head-on collisions and ring galaxy
formation.

detail. We conclude that as of the current date (mid-April 1996) the state of
the field is still somewhat muddled. However, we believe that there is now a
substantial body of evidence --- including a particularly revealing
intercomparison of the color-magnitude diagrams of \ngc{1851}, \ngc{288}, and
\ngc{362} presented here --- indicating that age is {\it not\/} the dominant
second parameter determining the shape of globular clusters' horizontal
branches. If our assertion is correct, then apart from a handful of anomalous
clusters that may well have been captured from a satellite dwarf galaxy, there
is no strong evidence either for a significant spread in age among clusters of
a given metal abundance or for a systematic variation of mean age with
Galactocentric distance. On the question of whether there is a significant age
difference between metal-poor and metal-rich clusters, we feel compelled to
fall back on the Scottish verdict: ``Unproven.'' Data now being collected by
numerous groups in various subdisciplines may resolve the remaining controversy
within a few years.

a factor of $\sim 3$ lower than in normal late-type galaxies. We show that LSB
galaxies in some respects resemble the outer parts of late-type normal
galaxies, but may be less evolved. LSB galaxies are more gas-rich than their
high surface brightness counterparts. The rotation curves of LSB galaxies rise
more slowly than those of HSB galaxies of the same luminosity, with amplitudes
between 50 and 120~km~s$^{-1}$, and are often still increasing at the outermost
measured point. The shape of the rotation curves suggests that LSB galaxies
have low matter surface densities. We use the average total mass surface
density of a galaxy as a measure for the evolutionary state, and show that LSB
galaxies are among the least compact, least evolved galaxies. We show that both
$M_{\rm HI}/L_B$ and $M_{\rm dyn}/L_B$ depend strongly on central surface
brightness, consistent with the surface brightness--mass-to-light ratio
relation required by the Tully-Fisher relation. LSB galaxies are therefore
slowly evolving galaxies, and may well be low surface density systems in all
respects.

conformal gauge approach of David, Distler and Kawai. The crucial point is the
choice of boundary conditions on the Liouville field. We discuss the Weyl
anomaly cancellation for Polyakov`s non-critical open bosonic string with
Neumann, Dirichlet and free boundary conditions. Dirichlet boundary conditions
on the Liouville field imply that the metric is discontinuous as the boundary
is approached. We consider the semi-classical limit and argue how it singles
out the free boundary conditions on the Liouville field. We define the open
string susceptibility, the anomalous gravitational scaling dimensions and a new
Yang-Mills Feynman mass critical exponent.

terms of an elliptic parametrization for some particular collection of planar
graphs describing the 2D $R^2$ quantum gravity. Along with the cosmological
constant $\lambda$ one has a coupling $\beta$ in the model corresponding to the
$R^2$-coupling constant. It is shown that for any value of $\beta$ the large
scale behavior of the model corresponds to that of the standard pure 2D quantum
gravity. On small distances it describes the dynamics of point-like curvature
defects introduced into the flat 2D space. The scaling function in the vicinity
of almost flat metric is obtained. The major steps of the exact solution are
given.

  Then we present a large number of applications of these principles, mainly to

CH, mostly for the case kappa=omega_2.
