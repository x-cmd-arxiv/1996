for Seyfert 1 galaxies, can be reconciled with the average Seyfert 1 spectrum
if we assume that the central source is completely hidden from our line of
sight by the thick part of the accretion disk or by the broad emission line
clouds. The observed X-ray radiation is produced by scattering of the Seyfert
1-type spectrum in the higher, cooler parts of the accretion disk corona, or in
a wind. A sharp cutoff appears as a result of the Compton recoil effect. This
model naturally explains a discrepancy regarding the inclination of the central
source, inferred to be low (face-on) from observations of the iron $K\alpha$
emission line, but inferred to be high on the basis of optical and UV
observations.

  Vol.468 September 20",,"10.1086/177754",,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss how luminosity and space distribution of galaxies are naturally
linked in view of their multifractal properties. In particular we show that the
mass (luminosity) function corresponding to a multifractal distribution in a
given observed volume, consists of a power law followed by an exponential
cut-off. This implies that the amplitude $\phi^*$ of the Schechter function
scales with the sample depth, as confirmed by various observational data. This
effect is analogous to the scaling of the space density due to the fractal
nature of the space distribution. This has the important consequence that the
luminosity function can be properly defined only in a volume limited sample.
Also the so-called ""luminosity segregation"" and the concept of bias correspond
to a natural consequence of multifractality. This implies however that they
should be considered from a different perspective with respect to the usual
one. Such a concept allows us to unify the space and luminosity distributions
as being shaped by a single cause:multifractality which should therefore claim
a central stage in theoretical investigations.

large dimerization limit where doping by Zn creates ``loose'' S=1/2 spins,
which interact with each other through very weak effective antiferromagnetic
couplings. When the dimerization is small, a similar effect is observed but now
with the free S=1/2 spins being the resulting S=1/2 ground state of severed
chains with an odd number of sites. Experimental consequences of these results

the chains are enhanced by Zn-doping according to the numerical data presented

ladders with non-magnetic impurities simply replacing the tendency to
dimerization in CuGeO$_3$ by the tendency to form spin-singlets along the rungs

classical scalar field through a symmetry breaking phase transition. In these
circumstances we determine the evolution of the ensemble averages of the
correlation length and topological defect densities. This clarifies many
aspects of the non-perturbative dynamics of fields in symmetry breaking phase
transitions and allows us to comment on a quantitative basis on the canonical
pictures for topological defect formation and evolution. We also compare these
results to those obtained from the field evolution in the Hartree approximation
or using the linearized theory. By doing so we conclude about the regimes of
validity of these approximations.

$B(\eta_c' \to h)$, where $h$ is an exclusive hadronic channel, and find that
for $h = K^o_s K^\pm \pi^\mp$ it may be possible to observe this state in two

  Contribution to the Workshop ""Continuous Advances in QCD, '96"", March 28-31,
  1996, Minneapolis, Minnesota",,,,"hep-ph",,"  In the framework of light-cone QCD sum rules, we study the valence quark
distribution function $q(x_B)$ of a pion for moderate $x_B$. The sum rule with
the leading twist-2 wave function gives $q(x_B)=\varphi_\pi(x_B)$. Twist-4 wave
functions give about 30\% for $x_B\sim 0.5$. It is shown that QCD sum rule
predictions, with the asymptotic pion wave function, are in good agreement with
experimental data. We found that a two-hump profile for the twist-2 wave
function leads to a valence quark disribution function that contradicts
experimental data.

coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators, we present an exact solution for the
tunneling problem in an Ohmic dissipative system with inverted harmonic

tunneling, the Brownian motion tends to enhance the tunneling. Whether the
tunneling rate increases or not would then depend on the initial conditions. We
give a specific formula to calculate the tunneling probability determined by
various parameters and the initial conditions.
