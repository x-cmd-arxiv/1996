  1996 issue of the Astronomical Journal",,"10.1086/118028",,"astro-ph",,"  I present sensitive high resolution HI VLA B+C+D array observations of the
edge-on Scd galaxy NGC 4244. The gas layer of NGC 4244 is rather symmetric in
all respects, i.e. the surface density distribution, flaring and warping, so
that the rotation curve (RC) is determined accurately, despite the fact that
i~90^o. The RC rises slowly in the inner 6 kpc, is ~ constant at 100 km/s out
to 10kpc, and decreases in Keplerian fashion by 15% at the last measured point
at 14 kpc. The RC constrains the stellar mass-to-light ratio to lie between 50
and 100% of the ``maximum-disk'' value.
  A new technique is presented to determine simultaneously the inclination and
the thickness of the gas layer from HI observations which uses the apparent
widths at many channels and works for i >= 60^o. The inclination of the un-
warped disk is about 84.5 degrees: beyond D25/2 the inclination changes gra-
dually till 82.5^o, while at large radii the disk seems to warp back to the
plane defined by the inner disk. The gaseous velocity dispersion is roughly
constant within the optical disk (8.5+/-1 km/s) and increases slightly beyond.
  The thickness of the gas layer increases gradually from 0.4 to 1.5 kpc. In an
accompanying paper (AJ, Aug. 1996; astro-ph/9605111). I use the measurements
presented in this paper to infer that the dark matter halo of NGC 4244 is
highly flattened.

  1996 issue of the Astronomical Journal",,"10.1086/118029",,"astro-ph",,"  In a previous paper (Olling 1995, \aj, 110, 591; astro-ph/9505002) a method
was developed to determine the shapes of dark matter halos of spiral galaxies
from an accurate determination of the rotation curve, the flaring of the gas
layer and the velocity dispersion in the HI. Here this method is applied to the
almost edge-on Scd galaxy NGC 4244 for which the necessary parameters are
determined in the accompanying paper (AJ, Aug. 1996; astro-ph/9605110).
  The observed flaring of the HI beyond the optical disk puts significant
constraints on the shape of the dark matter halo, which are almost independent
of the stellar mass-to-light ratio. NGC 4244's dark matter halo is found to be
highly flattened with a shortest-to-longest axis ratio of 0.2 (-0.1)(+0.3). If
the dark matter is disk-like, the data presented in this paper imply that the
vertical velocity dispersion of the dark matter must be 10% - 30% larger than
the measured tangential dispersion in the HI. Alternatively, the measured
flaring curve is consistent with a round halo if the gaseous velocity
dispersion ellipsoid is anisotropic. In that case the vertical dispersion of
the gas is 50 - 70% of the measured tangential velocity dispersion.

  Accepted for publication in Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/177906","YITP-96-16, KUCP0099, OU-TAP-37","astro-ph",,"  The recent {\em ASCA} results show that the iron abundance of the X-ray gas
of elliptical galaxies is less than the solar abundance ($Z_{\sun}$). The
observed low iron abundance is inconsistent with the predictions of the
previous chemical evolution models. In order to solve this problem, we present
a simple model of chemical evolution for elliptical galaxies after the galactic
wind period under the assumption that the gases ejected from stars do not mix
with the circumferential gas. The ejected gas components evolve separately
according to their birth time and origin. We have investigated their evolution
qualitatively. The gas components originated from supernova remnant shells cool
and drop out of the hot gas faster than the other components because of their
high density and metal abundance. As a result, supernovae cannot heat the whole
gas of the elliptical galaxies effectively, in contrary to the previous
results. If the metal abundance of mass-loss gas is not uniform, the mass-loss
gas with higher abundance also easily drops out and the average abundance can
decrease. We believe that this is a hint of solving the low abundance problem.

diffusive conductors in the presence of proximity induced superconducting
correlation. We calculated the linear conductance of the system, the profile of
the electric field and the densities of states. In the case of transparent
metallic boundaries the temperature dependent conductance has a non-monotoneous
``reentrant'' structure. We argue that this behavior is due to nonequilibrium
effects occuring in the normal metal in the presence of both superconducting
correlations and the electric field there. Low transparent tunnel barriers
suppress the nonequilibrium effects and destroy the reentrant behavior of the
conductance. If the wire contains a loop, the conductance shows Aharonov-Bohm
oscillations with the period $\Phi_0=h/2e$ as a function of the magnetic flux
$\Phi$ inside the loop. The amplitude of these oscillations also demonstrates
the reentrant behavior vanishing at $T=0$ and decaying as $1/T$ at relatively
large temperatures. The latter behavior is due to low energy correlated
electrons which penetrate deep into the normal metal and ``feel'' the effect of
the magnetic flux $\Phi$. We point out that the density of states and thus the
``strengh'' of the proximity effect can be tuned by the value of the flux
inside the loop. Our results are fully consistent with recent experimental
findings.

pseudoscalar mesons are investigated within a relativistic constituent quark
model formulated on the light-front. For the first time, the form factors are
calculated in the whole accessible kinematical region, adopting meson wave
functions derived from various effective $q \bar{q}$ interactions able to
describe the meson mass spectra. It is shown that the decay rates of the $B \to
D \ell \nu_{\ell}$, $D \to K \ell \nu_{\ell}$ and $D \to \pi \ell \nu_{\ell}$
weak decays are mainly governed by the effects of the confinement scale,
whereas the $B \to \pi \ell \nu_{\ell}$ decay rate is sensitive to the
high-momentum components generated in the meson wave functions by the effective
one-gluon-exchange interaction. Our results are consistent with available
experimental data and predictions of lattice $QCD$ calculations and $QCD$ sum
rules.
