power available to feed the jets in powerful FR II radio sources. For
unobscured radio-loud QSOs we present evidence that this power is directly
related to the UV-optical luminosity, or probably more accurately, to the power
radiated through processes of accretion in a strong gravitational potential. It
has been suggested on theoretical grounds that powerful radio jets are a
necessary component of the central engine. It then follows, from the similarity
of the optical-UV power output, spectral energy distribution, and emission-line
spectra of radio-loud and radio-quiet QSOs, that radio-quiet QSOs have the same
power available to feed jets as do radio-loud QSOs. This then leaves us with
the puzzle of why we do not see the powerful jets in radio-quiet QSOs.

dense gas within approximately 0.1 parsec of the central engine, out to
low-velocity, low-density gas at great distances from the host galaxy. In
radio-loud QSOs there are clear indications that the distribution and
kinematics of emission-line gas are related to the symmetry axis of the central
engine, as defined by the radio jet. These jets originate at nuclear distances
< 0.1 pc --- similar to the highest-velocity emission line gas. There are two
ways we can investigate the different environments of radio-loud and
radio-quiet QSOs, i.e., those with and without powerful radio jets. One is to
look for optical-UV spectroscopic differences between radio-loud and
radio-quiet QSOs. The other is to investigate dependences of spectroscopic
properties on properties of the powerful jets in radio-loud QSOs. Here we
summarize the spectroscopic differences between the two classes, and present
known dependences of spectra on radio core-dominance, which we interpret as
dependences on the angle of the central engine to the line-of-sight. We
speculate on what some of the differences may mean.

color-magnitude diagram. We find that almost regardless of the analytical
function used to describe the 3-D stars distribution of the Galactic bar, the
resulting models have the major axis inclined to the line of sight by
$20-30\deg$, with axis ratios corresponding to $x_0:y_0:z_0=3.5:1.5:1$. This

and 10 GHz for all PG quasars with radio flux densities between 4-200 mJy. We
find that a large fraction of these sources are variable, flat-spectrum
quasars. This brings the total fraction of flat-spectrum quasars with a ratio
between radio and optical flux of R>10 - a value previously used to define a
radio-loud quasar - to 40% in the PG quasar sample. We also find that the
median R-parameter of these flat-spectrum quasars is lower than those of
steep-spectrum radio-loud quasars. This contradicts the predictions of the
unified scheme and the idea that all flat-spectrum, core-dominated quasars are
relativistically boosted lobe-dominated quasars. We show that this discrepancy
is due to a population of flat-spectrum radio-intermediate quasars with
25<R<250 which can neither be explained as relativistically boosted radio-loud
quasars nor as normal radio-weak quasars. We point out that a natural
explanation for the flat-spectrum radio-intermediate quasars is relativistic
boosting in radio-weak quasars. If the flat-spectrum radio-intermediate quasars
are considered the boosted counterparts to usual radio-weak quasars, their
fraction among radio-weak quasars is roughly 10%, similar to the fraction of
boosted radio-loud quasars. This would point towards average Lorentz factors of
gamma_jet=2-4 for radio-loud and radio-weak quasars. The presence of the
flat-spectrum radio-intermediate quasars changes the definition of 'radio-loud'
and can bias some conclusions drawn from optically selected quasar samples,
where R ~ 1-10 is used as the dividing line for both, flat- and steep-spectrum
quasars. Instead one should use separate R-parameters for the dividing line in
steep- (R~25) and flat-spectrum (R~250) quasars.

itself as a time-dependent excluded volume effect. At the mean field level, the
heteropolymer chain is therefore dynamically equivalent to a homopolymer chain
with both time-independent and time-dependent excluded volume effects. The
perturbed relaxation spectrum is also calculated. We find that heterogeneity
also renormalizes the relaxation spectrum. However, we find, to the lowest
order in heterogeneity, that the relaxation spectrum does not exhibit any
dynamic freezing, at the point when static (equilibrium) ``freezing''
transition occurs in heteropolymer. Namely, the breaking of
fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) proposed for spin glass dynamics does not
have dynamic effect in heteropolymer, as far as relaxation spectrum is

(the elimination of diagrams containing virtual quark loops) is achieved by
extending the Lagrangian method of Bernard and Golterman, and is implemented in
a theory where baryons are treated as fixed velocity sources. Our method
requires that the octet baryons be represented by a three index tensor rather
than by the usual matrix field. We calculate the leading non-analytic
corrections to the masses of octet and decuplet baryons. In QCD these are
proportional to $M_\pi^3$. We find that quenching alters the $M_\pi^3$ terms,
but does not completely remove them. In addition, we find non-analytic
contributions to baryon masses proportional to $M_\pi$ and $M_\pi^2 \log
M_\pi$. These terms, which are artifacts of quenching, dominate over the
$M_\pi^3$ terms for sufficiently small quark masses. We also point out various
pecularities of the quenched theory, most notably that the $\Delta$ baryon can
decay (if kinematically allowed), in the sense that its two point function will
be dominated at long Euclidean times by a nucleon plus pion intermediate state.

This is a generalization of a result obtained by Leutwyler and Smilga for equal
quark masses. Our result is derived in the sector of zero topological charge
using a generalization of the Itzykson-Zuber integral appropriate for arbitrary
complex matrices. We present a conjecture regarding the result for arbitrary
topological charge which reproduces the Leutwyler-Smilga result in the limit of
equal quark masses. We derive a formula of the Itzykson-Zuber type for
arbitrary {\em rectangular} complex matrices, extending the result of Guhr and
Wettig obtained for {\em square} matrices.

is found that, under the Hartree approximation, the small cut-off makes the
equations of state hard, especially at higher densities. The theory is modified
in the framework of the renormalization group methods with arbitrary cut-off
$\Lambda^\prime$. It is found that the expansion in terms of the $\sigma$ meson
field is more favorable than the naive expansion of the inverse of
$\Lambda^\prime$, when we do not use very large $\Lambda^\prime$.

derivatives is proposed to search for dynamical symmetry operators in 2-dim
quantum and classical systems. These symmetry operators arise when closing the
SUSY algebra for a wide set of potentials. In some cases they are of 2-nd order
in derivatives. The particular solutions are obtained also for potentials
accepting symmetry operators of 4-th order. The investigation of quasiclassical
limit of the SUSY algebra yields new classical integrals of motion for a
certain type of systems which are polynomials of 4-th order in momenta. The
general SUSY-inspired algorithm to construct classical systems with additional
integrals of motion is outlined.
