of a large number of potential sources and measuring the combined magnification
of the images. This phenomenon could also be detected directly from the
gravitational deflection, by means of high precision astrometry using
interferometry. Relative astrometry at the level of $10\muas$ may become
possible in the near future. The gravitational deflection can be measured by
astrometric monitoring of a bright star having a background star within a small
angular separation. This type of monitoring program will be carried out for the
independent reasons of discovering planets from the angular motion they induce
on the nearby star around which they are orbiting, and for measuring
parallaxes, proper motions and orbits of binary stars. We discuss three
applications of the measurement of gravitational deflections by astrometric
monitoring: measuring the mass of the bright stars that are monitored,
measuring the mass of brown dwarfs or giant planets around the bright stars,
and detecting microlensing events by unrelated objects near the line of sight
to the two stars. We discuss the number of stars whose mass could be measured
by this procedure. We also give expressions for the number of expected
microlensing events by unrelated objects, which could be stars, brown dwarfs,

revisited a region with significant dust emission near the star Mu Pegasi. A
3.5 cm$^{-1}$ low frequency channel has been added since the previous
measurement (\cite{mei93a}). The data in each channel clearly show structure
correlated with IRAS 100 \micron\ dust emission. The spectrum of the structure
in the 6, 9 and 14 cm$^{-1}$ channels is described by
$I_{\nu}\propto\nu^{\beta}B_{\nu}(T_{dust})$, where $\beta$ = 1.3 and
$T_{dust}$ = 19~K and $B_{\nu}$ is the Planck function. However, this model
predicts a smaller amplitude in the 3.5 cm$^{-1}$ band than is observed.
Considering only linear combinations of the data independent of the best fit
foreground spectrum for the three lower channels, we find an upper limit to
CMBR fluctuations of $\Delta T/T = \langle

holes bind in pairs in two-dimensional antiferromagnets. For the case J/t=0.5,
which we have studied, the hole pairs reside predominantly on a 2x2 core
plaquette with the probability that the holes are on diagonal sites greater
than nearest-neighbor sites. There is a strong singlet bond connecting the
spins on the two remaining sites of the plaquette. We find that a general
characteristic of dynamic holes in an antiferromagnet is the presence of
frustrating antiferromagnetic bonds connecting next-nearest-neighbor sites
across the holes. Pairs of holes bind in order to share the frustrating bonds.
  At low doping, in addition to hole pairs, there are two additional low-energy
structures which spontaneously form on certain finite systems. The first is an
undoped Lx2 spin-liquid region, or ladder. The second is a hole moving along a
one dimensional chain of sites. At higher doping we expect that hole pairing is

the disk partition function and bulk magnetization can be expressed as

accompanying each power of $\delta$ are obtained by means of a dispersion
relation in $g$. These $g$-expansions are summed by a Borel transformation,
yielding an approximation to the ground-state energy for the region near the
isotropic limit. This approximation is found to be excellent in a rather wide
region of $\delta$ around $\delta = 0$. Special attention is devoted to the
immediate vicinity of the isotropic point. Using a simple model integral we
show that the large-order behavior of an $\delta$-dependent series expansion in
$g$ undergoes a crossover from an isotropic to an anisotropic regime as the
order $k$ of the expansion coefficients passes the value $k_{{\rm cross} \sim
1/ |{\delta}|$.
