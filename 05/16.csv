brightness drops by up to a magnitude, are observed at quasi-regular intervals.
This provides a crucial insight into the nature of the SSS and, in particular,
a chance to investigate the poorly understood behaviour of their accretion
discs. Analysis of the high state data reveals a small modulation of
semi-amplitude $\sim$~0.02 mag at $P=$0.76278$\pm$0.00005~d, a period which is
consistent with the current ``best'' suggested spectroscopic value.

at times of optical minima. From this, we conclude that the most likely cause
of the X-ray outbursts is a photospheric contraction during a nuclear shell
burning phase, rather than a thermonuclear flash or shocked emission. The
system probably comprises a relatively massive white dwarf accreting at a high
rate ($\sim 10^{-6} M_{\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$) from an evolved donor star, and

for preparing the gradient in induction time is by turbulent mixing and local
flame quenching. The criterion for DDT is derived in terms of the
one-dimensional detonation wave thickness, the laminar flame speed, and the
laminar flame thickness in the reactive gas. This approach gives a lower-bound
criterion for DDT for conditions where shock preheating, wall effects, and
interactions with obstacles are absent. Regions in parameter space where
unconfined DDT can and cannot occur are determined. A subsequent paper will

the phase transition between the two inflationary stages can trigger the

density perturbations in these models we develop a new method to calculate
density perturbations in a system of two scalar fields. We show that density
perturbations in hybrid inflation models of the new type can be very large on
the scale corresponding to the phase transition. The resulting density
inhomogeneities lead to a copious production of black holes. This could be an
argument against hybrid inflation models with two stages of inflation. However,
we find a class of models where this problem can be easily avoided. The number
of black holes produced in these models can be made extremely small, but in
general it could be sufficiently large to have important cosmological and
astrophysical implications. In particular, for certain values of parameters
these black holes may constitute the dark matter in the universe. It is also
possible to have hybrid models with two stages of inflation where the black
hole production is not suppressed, but where the typical masses of the black
holes are very small. Such models lead to a completely different thermal
history of the universe, where post-inflationary reheating occurs via black
hole evaporation.

reduces the central density of the compact object, making it more stable

maximum stable mass only slightly, but can actually lower the maximum central
density by as much as $30\%$. Thus a white dwarf in a close binary may be more
susceptible to general relativistic instability than the instability associated
with electron capture and pycronuclear reaction (depending on the white dwarf
composition). We analyse the radial stability of neutron star using
post-Newtonian approximation with an ideal degenerate neutron gas equation of

coalescing neutron star-neutron star or neutron star-black hole binaries does
not collapse prior to merger or tidal disruption.

star binary orbit is decaying on a time scale of $|\Porb/\dot\Porb|=0.5$ Myr,
shorter than the characteristic age ($\tau_c=3$ Myr) of the pulsar (Kaspi et
al.~1996a). We study mechanisms for the orbital decay. The standard weak
friction theory based on static tide requires far too short a viscous time to
explain the observed $\dot\Porb$. We show that dynamical tidal excitation of
g-modes in the B star can be responsible for the orbital decay. However, to
explain the observed short decay timescale, the B star must have some
significant retrograde rotation with respect to the orbit --- The retrograde
rotation brings lower-order g-modes, which couple much more strongly to the
tidal potential, into closer ``resonances'' with the orbital motion, thus
significantly enhancing the dynamical tide. A much less likely possibility is
that the g-mode damping time is much shorter than the ordinary radiative
damping time. The observed orbital decay timescale combined with a generic
orbital evolution model based on dynamical tide can be used as a ``timer'',
giving an upper limit of $1.4$ Myr for the age of the binary system since the
neutron star formation. Thus the characteristic age of the pulsar is not a good
age indicator. Assuming standard magnetic dipole braking for the pulsar and no
significant magnetic field decay on a timescale $\lo 1$ Myr, the upper limit
for the age implies that the initial spin of the neutron star at birth was
close to its current value.

Computing the flow of each object over a large part of its evolutionary time

phenomenologically different types of this instability. If two smooth flows
collide, the instability follows a periodic limit cycle with two modes being
important. The connection between the radiative loss function and the mode and
type of the overstability is discussed. The collision of non-smooth flows can
temporarily result in an aperiodic evolution of the system. After a
characteristic relaxation time the instability then becomes periodic again.
Such disturbances as well as violent types of the instability can excite
oscillations of the thin layer of cold compressed gas downstream of the shock,
which in turn can influence the stability of the radiative shock.

and p(y) are marginal distributions induced by p(x, y). We formulate this
problem as a sub-task of learning the conditional distribution p(x|y), by
exploiting the identity p(x|y) = A(x,y)*p(x). We propose a two-step estimation
method based on the MDL principle, which works as follows: It first estimates
p(x) as p1 using MDL, and then estimates p(x|y) for a fixed y by applying MDL
on the hypothesis class of {A * p1 | A \in B} for some given class B of
representations for association norm. The estimation of A is therefore obtained
as a side-effect of a near optimal estimation of p(x|y). We then apply this
general framework to the problem of acquiring case-frame patterns. We assume
that both p(x) and A(x, y) for given y are representable by a model based on a
classification that exists within an existing thesaurus tree as a `cut,' and
hence p(x|y) is represented as the product of a pair of `tree cut models.' We
then devise an efficient algorithm that implements our general strategy. We
tested our method by using it to actually acquire case-frame patterns and
conducted disambiguation experiments using the acquired knowledge. The

demonstrate that all flat directions can be lifted through a renormalizable

dynamical phenomena. For example, modifications to classical constraints can be
field dependent. We also consider the generalization to SU(n)xSU(3)xU(1) models
(with even n>4). We present a renormalizable superpotential which lifts all

perturbations, the analysis of supersymmetry breaking is very different in
these theories from the n=4 example. When the SU(n) gauge group confines, the
Yukawa couplings drive the SU(3) theory into a regime with a dynamically
generated superpotential. By considering a simplified version of these theories
we argue that supersymmetry is probably broken.

the black hole entropy in the limit in which the Schwarzschild radius becomes
larger than all compactification radii. We present evidence that a more
consistent description can be given in terms of strings with rescaled tensions.
We show that the rescaling can be interpreted as a redshift of the tension of a
fundamental string in the gravitational field of the black hole. An interesting
connection is found between the string level number and the Rindler energy.
Using this connection, we reproduce the entropies of Schwarzschild black holes
in arbitrary dimensions in terms of the entropy of a single string at the
Hagedorn temperature.

product-group gauge theories with the help of duality. As a test case we
investigate an SU(2)xSU(2) theory in detail. Various dual theories are
constructed using known simple-group duality for one group or both groups in
succession. Several stringent tests show that the low-energy behavior of the
dual theories agrees with that of the electric theory. When the theory is in
the confining phase we calculate the exact superpotential. Our results strongly
suggest that, in general, dual theories for product groups can be constructed
in this manner, by using simple-group duality for both groups. Turning to a
class of theories with SU(N)xSU(M) gauge symmetry we study the renormalization
group flows in the space of the two gauge couplings and show that they are
consistent with the absence of phase transitions. Finally, we show that a
subset of these theories, with SU(N)xSU(N-1) symmetry break supersymmetry
dynamically.

  (ignore the under/overfull \vbox error messages)",,,,"quant-ph comp-gas hep-th nlin.CG",,"  Unitarity of the global evolution is an extremely stringent condition on
finite state models in discrete spacetime. Quantum cellular automata, in
particular, are tightly constrained. In previous work we proved a simple No-go
Theorem which precludes nontrivial homogeneous evolution for linear quantum
cellular automata. Here we carefully define general quantum cellular automata
in order to investigate the possibility that there be nontrivial homogeneous
unitary evolution when the local rule is nonlinear. Since the unitary global
transition amplitudes are constructed from the product of local transition
amplitudes, infinite lattices require different treatment than periodic ones.
We prove Unitarity Theorems for both cases, expressing the equivalence in $1+1$
dimensions of global unitarity and certain sets of constraints on the local
rule, and then show that these constraints can be solved to give a variety of
multiparameter families of nonlinear quantum cellular automata. The Unitarity
Theorems, together with a Surjectivity Theorem for the infinite case, also
imply that unitarity is decidable for one dimensional cellular automata.
