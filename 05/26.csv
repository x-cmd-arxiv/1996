cosmic rays above about 40EeV (4x10^19eV) in pairs near the supergalactic plane

information on origin and nature of these events and, in case of charged
primaries, imply interesting constraints on the extragalactic magnetic field.
The observed time correlation would most likely rule out an association of
these events with cosmological gamma ray bursts. If no prominent astrophysical
source candidates such as powerful radiogalaxies can be found, the existence of
a mechanism involving new fundamental physics would be favored.

bands ranging from $g$ to $K$$'$ (1300--6000 \AA~rest wavelength) are fitted
with population synthesis models from Bruzual \& Charlot (1993). The data
confirm a very young age for this galaxy, in agreement with ages estimated from
preliminary \CIV~P-Cygni profile modeling. Single-burst models with ages
greater than about 20 Myr can be discarded at the 99\% confidence level, and
continuous star formation models with ages greater than about 35 Myr can be
discarded at the 95\% confidence level. The spectral energy distribution is
most consistent with a continuous star formation model of about 10--20 Myr,
with reddening of $E(B-V)\sim 0.3$. No evidence for an older population of
stars is seen, but the possibility of an older population with as much as 90\%
of the galaxy mass cannot be ruled out. We discuss the possible ramifications
of a non-standard IMF and gravitational lensing on the galaxy's age and mass.

corresponding Lambda parameter. The role of lattice artifacts and finite-volume
effects is carefully analysed and these appear to be under control in the
momentum range of interest. Our renormalisation procedure corresponds to a
momentum subtraction scheme in continuum field theory, and therefore lattice
perturbation theory is not needed in order to match our results to the MSbar
scheme, thus eliminating a major source of uncertainty in the determination of
alpha_MSbar. Our method can be applied directly to the unquenched case.
