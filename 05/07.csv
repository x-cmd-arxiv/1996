calibration and a technique less sensitive to the calibration uncertainties,
and find a temperature decline with radius in good agreement with ASCA's. We
also present ASCA temperature maps and radial profiles of A3558 and AWM7 and
compare them to the published ROSAT results. In A3558, we detect an asymmetric
temperature pattern and a slight radial decline. We do not find any significant
temperature variations in AWM7, except around the cD galaxy. Radial temperature
profiles of these two clusters are in a qualitative agreement with ROSAT.
However, while their ASCA average temperatures agree with other high-energy
instruments, ROSAT temperatures are lower by factors of 1.7 and 1.25,
respectively. We find that including realistic estimates of the current ROSAT
systematic uncertainties enlarges the temperature confidence intervals so that
ROSAT measurements are consistent with others for these clusters as well. Due
to the limited energy coverage of ROSAT PSPC, its results for the hotter
clusters are highly sensitive to calibration uncertainties. We conclude that at
the present calibration accuracy, there is no disagreement between ASCA and
other instruments. On the scientific side, a ROSAT temperature underestimate
for A3558 may be responsible for the anomalously high gas to total mass

the restoration of flavor symmetry and universality properties of production of
different vector mesons as a function of $Q^{2}+m_{V}^{2}$. The color dipole

  functions","DVI and Post-Script files only. To appear in J. London Math. Soc",,,"MAGNUS preprint #96-05-06A","math.GR",,"  We describe a general technique for embedding certain amalgamated products
into direct products. This technique provides us with a way of constructing a
host of finitely presented subgroups of automatic groups which are not even
asynchronously automatic. We can also arrange that such subgroups satisfy, at
best, an exponential isoperimetric inequality.

"math/9605228","John Franks","John Franks","The rotation set and periodic points for torus homeomorphisms",,,,"Dynamical Systems 5/7/96","math.DS",,"  We consider the rotation set $\rho(F)$ for a lift $F$ of an area preserving
homeomorphism $f: \t^2\to \t^2$, which is homotopic to the identity. The
relationship between this set and the existence of periodic points for $f$ is
least well understood in the case when this set is a line segment. We show that
in this case if a vector $v$ lies in $\rho(F)$ and has both co-ordinates
rational, then there is a periodic point $x\in \t^2$ with the property that
$$\frac{F^q(x_0)-x_0}q = v$$ where $x_0\in \re^2$ is any lift of $x$ and $q$ is
the least period of $x$.
