1275, the highly active cD galaxy at the center of the Perseus cluster. We find
a modest excess of faint ($R > 22.5$) starlike objects in its halo, indicating
a population of old-halo globular clusters. However, the total estimated
cluster population corresponds to a specific frequency of $S_N = 4.4 \pm 1.2$,
no larger than that of normal giant ellipticals and three times lower than that
of other central cD galaxies such as M87. We discuss several ideas for the
origin of this galaxy. Our results reinforce the view that high $S_N$ (ie:
highly efficient globular cluster formation) is not associated with cooling
flows, or with recent starburst or merger phenomena.

  file. Submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/283.4.1197","MPAxxx","astro-ph",,"  The microlensing probability (optical depth $\tau$) toward the Galactic
center carries information about the mass distribution of the Galactic
bulge/bar, so can be used to constrain the very uncertain shape parameters of
the bar. We find $tau$ depends on the bar mass, radial profile, angle, axis
scale lengths and boxyness by a few simple analytical formulae, which shows:
(1) $\tau$ is proportional to the mass of the bar, $M$. (2) $\tau$ falls along
the minor axis with a strong gradient. (3) An oblate bulge can have more
optical depth than a triaxial bar if the bar angle $\alpha>45$ degress. (4)
$\tau$ is the largest if the angle $\alpha$ and the axis ratio $y_0/x_0$
conspires so that $y_0/x_0=\tan \alpha$. (5) At a fixed field on the minor axis
but away from the center, boxy bars with a flat density profile tend to give a
larger optical depth than ellipsoidal bars with a steep profile. (6) Main
sequence sources should have a significantly lower (20-50\% lower) optical
depth than red clump giants if main sequence stars are not observed as deep as
the bright clump giants.
  An application to four COBE-constrained models (Dwek et al. 1994) shows most
models produce optical depth $2\sigma$ lower than MACHO and OGLE observed
values even with both a massive bar $2.8\times 10^{10} M_\odot$ and a full
disk. The high $\tau$ argues for a massive ($> 2\times 10^{10}M_\odot$) boxy
bar with $y_0/x0\approx \tan\alpha$ and $\alpha<20$ deg and with a flat radial
profile up to corotation.

IR-luminous galaxies from the Extended 12 Micron Galaxy Sample and the
optically-selected CfA Sample. Roughly half of the Seyferts (mostly Seyfert 1s)
have been fitted to an absorbed power-law model, yielding an average gamma of
2.26+-0.11 for 43 Seyfert 1s and 2.45+-0.18 for 10 Seyfert 2s, with both types
having a median value of 2.3.
  The soft X-ray (SXR) luminosity correlates with the 12um luminosity, with
Seyfert 1s having relatively more SXR emission than Seyfert 2s of similar
mid-infrared luminosities, by a factor of 1.6+-0.3. Several physical
interpretations of these results are discussed, including the standard unified
model for Seyfert galaxies. Infrared-luminous non-Seyferts are shown to have
similar distributions of SXR luminosity and X-ray-to-IR slope as Seyfert 2s,
suggesting that some of them may harbor obscured active nuclei (as has already
been shown to be true for several objects) and/or that the soft X-rays from
some Seyferts 2s may be non-nuclear.
  A SXR luminosity function (XLF) is calculated for the 12um sample, which is
well described by a single power-law with a slope of -1.75. The normalization
of this XLF agrees well with that of a HXR selected sample. Several of our
results, related to the XLF and the X-ray-to-IR relation are shown to be
consistent with the HXR observations of the 12um sample by Barcons et al.

  It is found that the solutions for the mean relative physical velocity depend
on the three-point spatial correlation function and the skewness of the

the assumptions which Davis \& Peebles took in his paper. It is found, however,
that their assumptions may not be general in real.
  The power index of the two-point correlation function in the strongly
nonlinear regime depends on the mean relative peculiar velocity, the
three-point correlation function and the skewness. If the self-similar
solutions exist, the power index in the strongly nonlinear regime is related to
the power index of the initial power spectrum and its relation depends on the
three-point correlation function and the skewness through the mean relative
peculiar velocity.
  Furthermore it is found that the mean relative physical velocity should have
the values between 0 and the Hubble expanding velocity. When the mean relative
physical velocity equals to the Hubble expanding velocity, there might exist
self-similar solutions in which the power index of the two-point correlation
function in the strongly nonlinear regime is independent of the initial power

when one of the local slopes exceeds a critical value sigma _c. By varying the
probability of toppling p we find that a continuous phase transition occurs at
the critical probability p_c, at which the steady states with zero average
slope (above p_c) are replaced by states characterized by a finite average
slope (below p_c). We study this phase transition in detail by introducing an
appropriate order parameter and the order-parameter susceptibility chi. In a
certain range of p<1 we find the self- organized critical behavior which is
characterized by nonuniversal p-dependent scaling exponents for the probability
distributions of size and length of avalanches. We also calculate the
anisotropy exponent zeta and the fractal dimension d_f of relaxation clusters

relaxation clusters in our model are anisotropic and can be described as
fractals for values of $p$ above the transition point. Below the transition
they are isotropic and compact.

surfaces reveal a twofold anomaly in the respective dispersion curves. In order
to explain this unusual behavior we performed density-functional theory
calculations of the atomic and electronic structure, the vibrational
properties, and the electronic susceptibility of those surfaces. Our work
provides evidence for hydrogen adsorption induced Fermi-{}surface nesting. The
respective nesting vectors are in excellent agreement with the HAS data and
recent angle resolved photoemission experiments of the H-covered alloy system
Mo_0.95Re_0.05(110). Also, we investigated the electron-phonon coupling and
discovered that the Rayleigh phonon frequency is lowered for those critical
wave vectors compared to the clean surfaces. Moreover, the smaller indentation
in the HAS spectra can be clearly identified as a Kohn anomaly. Based on our
results for the susceptibility and the recently improved understanding of the
He scattering mechanism we argue that the larger anomalous dip is due to
electron-hole excitations by the He scattering.

behavior of realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions is investigated when
on-shell equivalent nucleon-nucleon potentials are used. The study is based on
applications of the full-folding optical model potential for an explicit
treatment of the off-shell behavior of the nucleon-nucleon effective
interaction. Applications were made at beam energies between 40 and 500 MeV for
proton scattering from 40Ca and 208Pb. We use the momentum-dependent Paris
potential and its local on-shell equivalent as obtained with the
Gelfand-Levitan and Marchenko inversion formalism for the two nucleon
Schroedinger equation. Full-folding calculations for nucleon-nucleus scattering
show small fluctuations in the corresponding observables. This implies that
off-shell features of the NN interaction cannot be unambiguously identified
with these processes. Inversion potentials were also constructed directly from
NN phase-shift data (SM94) in the 0-1.3 GeV energy range. Their use in
proton-nucleus scattering above 200 MeV provide a superior description of the
observables relative to those obtained from current realistic NN potentials.
Limitations and scope of our findings are presented and discussed.

latter approaches can only be applied to systems for which a nonrelativistic

trial hamiltonian within a path integral framework and thus can also be applied
to relativistic and field theoretical problems. We derive a diagrammatic scheme
for the new approach and show how a particular choice of the trial hamiltonian
corresponds exactly to the use of a Jastrow correlated ansatz for the wave
function in the Fermi Hypernetted Chain approach. We show how our new approach
can be used to find upper bounds to ground state energies in systems which the
FHNC cannot handle, including those described by an energy-dependent effective
hamiltonian. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to a quantum field
theoretical system of interacting pions and nucleons.

put forward. This is a dispersive generalization of the classical
Newell-Whitehead-Segel (NWS) equation. Transverse stability of plane waves is
considered within the framework of this equation. It is shown that the
dispersion terms drastically alter the stability. A necessary stability
condition is obtained in the form of a transverse Benjamin-Feir criterion. If
this condition is met, a quarter of the plane-wave existence band (in terms of
the squared wave number) is unstable, while three quarters are transversely
stable. Next, linear defects in the form of grain boundaries (GB's) are
studied. An effective Burgers equation is derived from the dispersive NWS
equation, in the framework of which a GB is tantamount to a shock wave. It is
shown that the GB's are generic solutions. Asymmetric GB's are moving at a
constant velocity, which is found. The integrability of the Burgers equation
allows one as well to analyze transient processes and interactions between
parallel GB's. The shock-wave solutions obtained in this work may also find
applications in nonlinear fiber optics.
