quantitative analysis of the statistical quality of the available galaxy
samples. These are the dilution effect and the small scale fluctuations. We
show that the various data that are considered as pointing to a homogenous
distribution are all affected by these spurious effects and their
interpretation should be completely changed. In particular, we show that finite
size effects strongly affect the determination of the galaxy number counts,
namely the number versus magnitude relation ($N(<m)$) as computed from the
origin. When one computes $N(<m)$ averaged over all the points of a redshift
survey one observes an exponent $\alpha = D/5 \approx 0.4$ compatible with the
fractal dimension $D \approx 2$ derived from the full correlation analysis.
Instead the observation of an exponent $\alpha \approx 0.6$ at relatively small
scales, where the distribution is certainly not homogeneous, is shown to be
related to finite size effects. We conclude therefore that the observed counts
correspond to a fractal distribution with dimension $D \approx 2$ in the entire
range $12 \ltapprox m \ltapprox 28$, that is to say the largest scales ever
probed for luminous matter. In addition our results permit to clarify various
problems of the angular catalogs, and to show their compatibility with the
fractal behavior. We consider also the distribution of Radio-galaxies, Quasars
and $\gamma$ ray burst, and we show their compatibility with a fractal
structure with $D \approx 1.6 \div 1.8$. Finally we have established a
quantitative criterion that allows us to define and {\em predict} the
statistical validity of a galaxy catalog (angular or three dimensional).

burst at high redshift. Aging of their stellar populations subsequently caused
them to fade and become redder. The Canada-France Redshift Survey provides a
sample of about 125 galaxies with the luminosities and colours of passively
evolving giant ellipticals and with 0.1 < z < 1. This sample is inconsistent
with the standard evolutionary picture with better than 99.9% confidence. The
standard Schmidt test gives <V/V_{max}> = 0.398 when restricted to objects with
no detected star formation, and <V/V_{max}> = 0.410 when objects with emission
lines are also included. A smaller sample of early-type galaxies selected from
tha Hawaii Deep Survey gives equally significant results. With increasing
redshift a larger and larger fraction of the nearby elliptical and S0
population must drop out of of the sample, either because the galaxies are no
longer single units or because star formation alters their colours. If the
remaining fraction is modelled as F=(1+z)^{-\gamma}, the data imply gamma = 1.5
+- 0.3. At z=1 only about one third of bright E and S0 galaxies were already
assembled and had the colours of old passively evolving systems. We discuss the
sensitivity of these results to the incompleteness corrections and stellar
population models we have adopted. We conclude that neither is uncertain enough
to reconcile the observations with the standard picture. Hierarchical galaxy
formation models suggest that both merging and recent star formation play a
role in the strong evolution we have detected.

such collisions will typically deposit a substantial fraction of the envelope
mass into the disk on each passage. Repeated encounters will then lead to the
complete destruction of the star save for the dense core. We estimate the rate
of fuel supply by this mechanism using simple models for the AGN disk and
central stellar cluster. If the central stellar density is of order 10^7 solar
masses per cubic pc, then stripping of giants could account for the activity of
typical AGN provided that the accretion disk extends beyond 0.1 pc. For AGN
with smaller disks, or clusters of lower central density, giant stripping could
be an important source of gas enriched via stellar nucleosynthesis.

concerns to the nature and the existence of dust in active galaxies: for
instance, under which conditions does the very hard ionizing continuum of an
AGN allows the survival of dust grains? Is the composition and size
distribution of the dust the same as in our local interstellar medium? How is
dust distributed compared to the gas which is at least in part highly ionized

a macroscopic state of the system is specified by two parameters: the area of

thermodynamical properties of the system from its microscopics we use the
standard statistical mechanical method of Gibbs. Under a certain number of
assumptions on the quantum behavior of the system, we find that its microscopic
(quantum) states are described by states of quantum Chern-Simons theory defined
by sets of points on B labelled with spins. The level of the Chern-Simons
theory turns out to be proportional to the horizon area of black hole measured
in Planck units. The statistical mechanical analysis turns out to be especially
simple in the case when the entire interior of B is occupied by a black hole.
We find in this case that the entropy contained within B, that is, the black

the magnetic Yang--Mills amplitude of the background solution. The

to the fluctuations with even parity. The main difficulty arises because the
Schwarzschild gauge -- which is usually imposed to eliminate the gravitational

end-irreducible; there are no proper, incompressible embeddings of $S^1 \times

subset whose complement is anannular; there is a compact subset of $M$ whose
complement is $\bold P^2$-irreducible.

non-trivial plane in $M$ is boundary-parallel; every proper surface in $M$ each
component of which has non-empty boundary and is non-compact and simply
