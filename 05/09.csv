  Arrays (ed. P. Shaver)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  I discuss recent theoretical work on the formation and evolution of galaxies
paying particular attention to the ability of current models to make detailed
comparisons with observations of the galaxy population both nearby and at high
redshift. These models suggest that much (perhaps most) star formation in the
universe took place in objects that are already detected in deep galaxy
samples. In addition, they predict that systems with large star formation rates
are unlikely to be much more abundant in the past than they are at present.
Recent data show that the star formation rate in the nearby universe is, in
fact, a substantial fraction of that required to make all the stars seen in
galaxies, and that the observed abundance of objects forming stars at rates in
excess of 10 solar masses per yr is approximately the same at redshifts of 1.25
and 3.25 as it is at z = 0. Both the epoch of galaxy formation and ``typical''
protogalaxies may already have been observed but not recognised. Thermal
emission from dust in such protogalaxies could be detected by a large
millimeter array, and molecular line observations could explore the dynamical
state of the gas in the more massive systems.

to gravomagnetic forces, there is no systematic method of constructing vacuum
stationary fields for which the non-diagonal component of the metric is a free

stationary fields via simple algebraic transformations. Such disks can generate
a great variety of different metrics including Kerr's metric with any ratio of

filled-in and \li absorption, as expected for their young age. From the
equivalent widths of \ha emission excess (obtained using the spectral
subtraction technique) and the \lii feature, we have derived \ha emission
fluxes and photospheric Li abundances. The mean Li abundance of IC~4665
solar-type stars is log N(Li)=3.1; the same as in other young clusters
($\alpha$~Per, Pleiades) and T Tauri stars. Our results support the conclusions
from previous works that PMS Li depletion is very small for masses $\sim$ 1
\msun . Among the IC 4665 late-G and early K-type stars, there is a spread in
Li abundances of about one order of magnitude. The Li-poor IC~4665 members have
low \ha excess and vsin{\it i}$\le$10. Hence, the Li-activity-rotation
connection which has been clearly established in the Pleiades also seems to
hold in IC 4665. One M-type IC~4665 star that we have observed does not show
Li, implying a very efficient Li depletion as observed in $\alpha$~Per stars of
the same spectral type.
  The level of chromospheric activity and Li depletion among the low mass stars
of IC 4665 is similar to that in the Pleiades. In fact, we note that the Li
abundance distributions in several young clusters
  ($\alpha$~Per, Pleiades, IC~2391, IC~4665) and in post T Tauri stars are
strikingly similar. This result suggests that \ha emission and Li abundance not
well correlated with age for low mass stars between 20 and 100 Myr old. We

orders of magnitude below solar. The result comes from observations of the

from DLA absorbers with small dust depletion and negligible HII contamination.
In particular, in two DLA systems nitrogen is detected and at remarkably high
levels (Vladilo et al. 1995, Molaro et al. 1995, Green et al. 1995, Kulkarni et
al. 1996). Here we compare the predictions from chemical evolution models of
galaxies of different morphological type with the abundances and abundance
ratios derived for such systems. We conclude that solar ratios and relatively
high nitrogen abundances can be obtained in the framework of a chemical
evolution model assuming short but intense bursts of star formation, which in
turn trigger enriched galactic winds, and a primary origin for nitrogen in
massive stars. Such a model is the most successful in describing the chemical
abundances of dwarf irregular galaxies and in particular of the peculiar galaxy
IZw18. Thus, solar ratios at very low absolute abundances, if confirmed, seem
to favour dwarf galaxies rather than spirals as the progenitors of at least
some of the DLA systems.

a spatially inhomogeneous regime of {\it plastic} flow, with a very defective
vortex array and a channel-like structure of the flowing regions. The two
regimes are characterized by qualitatively different spatial distribution of
vortex velocities. In the crinkle regime the distribution of vortex velocities
near threshold has a single maximum that shifts to larger velocities as the
driving force is increased. In the plastic regime the distribution of vortex
velocities near threshold has a clear bimodal structure that persists upon
time-averaging the individual velocities. The bimodal structure of the velocity

problems of mode decomposition and almost-classicality without introducing
further principles. In order to emphasize the general nature of approximate
local quantum mechanical structures, we modify the standard WKB-expansion
method so as to rely on exact congruences of classical paths, rather than a
division of variables into classical and quantum. The only exact mathematical
structures our interpretation needs are the space of solutions of the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the Klein-Gordon type indefinite scalar product.
The latter boils down to plus or minus the ordinary quantum mechanical scalar
product in the local quantum structures. According to our approach all further
structures, in particular the concepts encountered in conventional physics,
such as observables, time and unitarity, are approximate. Our interpretation
coincides to some extent with the standard WKB-oriented view, but the way in
which the conventional concepts emerge, and the accuracy at which they are
defined at all, are more transparent. A simpler book-keeping of normalization
issues is automatically achieved. Applying our scheme to the Hawking model, we

breaking we assume is technicolor, with a walking coupling $\atc$, and extended
technicolor. The reactions discussed occur mainly at subprocess energies
$\rshat \simle 1\,\tev$. They include production of color-singlet and octet
technirhos and their decay into pairs of technipions, longitudinal weak bosons,
or jets. Technipions, in turn, decay predominantly into heavy fermions. Many of
these signatures are also expected to occur in topcolor-assisted technicolor.
Several particles specific to this new scenario are discussed. Additional
signatures of flavor dynamics, associated with quark and lepton substructure,
may be sought in excess production rates for high $E_T$ and invariant mass
dijets and dileptons. An important feature of these processes is that they
exhibit fairly central angular and rapidity distributions.

IIA string theory in both ten and nine space-time dimensions. We point out how
to obtain the O(1, 1) invariance of the NS-NS sector of the string effective
action correctly in nine dimensions. We dimensionally reduce the type IIB
string effective action on $S^1$ and show that the resulting nine dimensional
theory can be mapped, purely from the bosonic consideration, exactly to the
type IIA theory by an O(1, 1) or Buscher's T-duality transformations. We then
give a dynamical argument, in analogy with that for the type IIB theory in ten
dimensions, to show how an S-duality in the type IIA theory can be understood
from the underlying nine dimensional theory by compactifying M-theory on a
T-dual torus $\tilde {T}^2$.

even function $b\in L_1(\Omega)$ so that $H^q(x)=\int_\Omega |(x,\xi)|^q
b(\xi)\ d\xi$ for every $x\in \Omega.$ This representation has numerous
applications in convex geometry, probability and Banach space theory. In this
paper, we present a simple formula (in terms of the derivatives of $H$) for
calculating $b$ out of $H.$ We use this formula to give a sufficient condition
for isometric embedding of a space into $L_p$ which contributes to the 1937
P.Levy's problem and to the study of zonoids. Another application gives a
Fourier transform formula for the volume of $(n-1)$-dimensional central
sections of star bodies in $R^n.$ We apply this formula to find the minimal and
maximal volume of central sections of the unit balls of the spaces $\ell_p^n$
with $0<p<2.$

the Bochner $L_p$ spaces are nicely smooth if and only if $X$ is both nicely
