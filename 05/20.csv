  Astronomy & Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  This paper presents an analysis of the correlation between the far-infrared
(FIR) and the radio emission of starburst galaxies. Data for interacting
galaxies, many of which are undergoing a starburst, and for normal galaxies
have been analysed and compared in order to test for any influence of the
star-formation activity on the ratio between the FIR and the radio emission at
2.4 GHz, $\q24$. No statistically significant indication for such an influence
has been found: There is neither a significant difference between $\q24$ of the
two samples nor a dependence of this ratio on the starburst strength. This
observational fact is unexpected because of the different physical conditions
and the short time-scale of the star-formation activity in a starburst. In
order to interprete the observations the FIR and the radio emission during a
starburst have been modeled. The following conclusions could be drawn from the
observed constancy of $\q24$: A strong and fast ($\approx 10^7$ yr) increase of
the magnetic field at the beginning of the starburst is required in order to
maintain a constant $\q24$. Otherwise the strong Inverse Compton losses that
are due to the intense radiation field in a starburst would lower the
synchrotron emission drastically resulting in a value of $\q24$ significantly
higher than the observed one. Furthermore, the time-scale of the variation of
the star-formation rate has to be longer than some $10^7$ yr. For lower values
the different time-scales of the FIR and the radio emission produce large
fluctuations of $\q24$.

frequencies based on the observed luminosity functions and radio spectra of
normal galaxies and radio galaxies. We have constructed models for the spectra
of these two classes of objects down to low frequencies based on observations
of our Galaxy, other normal galaxies and radio galaxies. We check that the
models and evolution of the luminosity functions give source counts consistent
with data and calculate the radio background expected from kHz to GHz
frequencies.
  The motivation for this calculation is that the propagation of ultra-high
energy gamma-rays in the universe is limited by photon-photon pair production
on the radio background. Electromagnetic cascades involving photon-photon pair
production and subsequent synchrotron radiation in the intergalactic magnetic
field may develop. Such gamma-rays may be produced in acceleration sites of
ultra-high energy cosmic rays, as a result of interactions with the microwave
background, or emitted as a result of decay or annihilation of topological
defects. We find that photon-photon pair production on the radio background
remains the dominant attenuation process for gamma-rays from $3 \times 10^{10}$
GeV up to GUT scale energies.
