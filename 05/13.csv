Other 37 versions of the original series are generated, including ``seasonally
adjusted'' data, a smoothed series, series without annual course, etc. Modified
methods of Grassberger and Procaccia are applied. A procedure for selection of
the ``meaningful'' scaling region is proposed. Several scaling regions are
revealed in the ln C(r) versus ln r diagram. The first one in the range of
larger ln r has a gradual slope and the second one in the range of intermediate
ln r has a fast slope. Other two regions are settled in the range of small ln
r. The results lead us to claim that the series arises from the activity of at
least two subsystems. The first subsystem is low-dimensional (d_f=1.6) and it
possesses the potential predictability of several weeks. We suggest that this
subsystem is connected with seasonal variability of weather. The second
subsystem is high-dimensional (d_f>17) and its error-doubling time is about 4-7
days. It is found that the predictability differs in dependence on season. The
predictability time for summer, winter and the entire year (T_2 approx. 4.7
days) is longer than for transition-seasons (T_2 approx. 4.0 days for spring,
T_2 approx. 3.6 days for autumn). The role of random noise and the number of
data points are discussed. It is shown that a 15-year-long daily temperature
series is not sufficient for reliable estimations based on Grassberger and

the effect of interchain coupling for a finite number of parallel chains. In
the case of spin chains coupled by exchange interactions, the low--energy
properties are radically different according to whether the number of coupled
chains is even or odd: even number of chains have a gap in the spin
excitations, whereas odd numbers of chains are gapless. The effect of
interchain tunneling is analyzed for two and three coupled chains of itinerant
fermions: for repulsive interactions, the two--chain system is ``universally''
found to be a d--wave superconductor, with a gap in the spin excitation
spectrum. On the other hand, for three chains the ground state depends both on
the boundary conditions in the transverse direction and on the strength of the
interactions. Weak repulsive interactions in all cases lead to dominant
superconducting pairing of d--type. An example of a three--leg spin ladder with
a spin gap is proposed. A general scheme to keep track of fermion
anticommutation in the bosonization technique is developed.

date the vacuum energy gravitates. We present a model where a new measure is
introduced for integration of the total action in the D-dimensional space-time.
This measure is built from D scalar fields $\varphi_{a}$. As a consequence of
such a choice of the measure, the matter lagrangian $L_{m}$ can be changed by
adding a constant while no gravitational effects, like a cosmological term, are
induced. Such Non-Gravitating Vacuum Energy (NGVE) theory has an infinite
dimensional symmetry group which contains volume-preserving diffeomorphisms in
the internal space of scalar fields $\varphi_{a}$. Other symmetries contained
in this symmetry group, suggest a deep connection of this theory with theories
of extended objects. In general {\em the theory is different from GR} although
for certain choices of $L_{m}$, which are related to the existence of an
additional symmetry, solutions of GR are solutions of the model. This is
achieved in four dimensions if $L_{m}$ is due to fundamental bosonic and
fermionic strings. Other types of matter where this feature of the theory is
realized, are for example: scalars without potential or subjected to nonlinear
constraints, massless fermions and point particles. The point particle plays a
special role, since it is a good phenomenological description of matter at
large distances. de Sitter space is realized in an unconventional way, where
the de Sitter metric holds, but such de Sitter space is supported by the
existence of a variable scalar field which in practice destroys the maximal
symmetry. The only space - time where maximal symmetry is not broken, in a
dynamical sense, is Minkowski space. The theory has non trivial dynamics in 1+1
dimensions, unlike GR.

extremal dilaton black holes, it has been suggested that solutions with
scalar/Maxwell parameters $a=\sqrt{3}$, $1$, $1/\sqrt{3}$ and $0$ correspond to
$1-$, $2-$, $3-$ and $4$-particle bound states at threshold. (For example, the
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is just a superposition of four Kaluza-Klein
black holes). Here we show that not only the masses, electric charges and
magnetic charges but also the spins and supermultiplet structures of the string
states are consistent with this interpretation. Their superspin $L$ corresponds
to the Kerr-type angular momentum and hence only the $L=0$ elementary BPS
states are black holes. Moreover, these results generalize to super $p$-branes
in $D$-dimensions. By constructing multi-centered $p$-brane solitons, the new
super $p$-branes found recently with various values of
$a^2=\Delta-2(p+1)(D-p-3)/(D-2)$ are seen to be bound states of the fundamental
ones with $\Delta=4$.

The Lorentz- and CPT-preserving solution previously suggested in the literature
is confirmed through level 12 in the action. A family of Lorentz-breaking,
CPT-preserving solutions of the equations of motion is found to persist and
converge through level 18 in the action. Two sequences of solutions
spontaneously breaking both Lorentz invariance and CPT are discussed. The
analysis at this level involves the analytical form of over 20,000 terms in the

issue that has been overlooked in many recent contributions on the derivation
of domain wall effective actions. We show that, unless such redundancy is
completely removed by means of a sort of gauge-fixing, the expression obtained
for the effective action will not be consistent. We readdress some earlier
calculations over the existence of curvature corrections in the light of the
previous discussion and briefly comment on the application of this method to
higher dimensional topological defects.

groups are also very closely related to the study of residually free groups and

might speed up certain computations dramatically. Interest in quantum
computation has since been growing. One of the main difficulties of realizing
quantum computation is that decoherence tends to destroy the information in a
superposition of states in a quantum computer, thus making long computations
impossible. A futher difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state
transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering the output of
long computations unreliable. It was previously known that a quantum circuit
with t gates could tolerate O(1/t) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per
gate. We show, for any quantum computation with t gates, how to build a
polynomial size quantum circuit that can tolerate O(1/(log t)^c) amounts of
inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some constant c. We do this by showing
how to compute using quantum error correcting codes. These codes were
previously known to provide resistance to errors while storing and transmitting
quantum data.
