effects of a photoionizing UV background on the assembly of disk galaxies in
hierarchically clustering universes. We focus on the mass and rotational
properties of gas that can cool to form centrifugally supported disks in dark
matter halos of different mass. Photoheating can significantly reduce the
amount of gas that can cool in galactic halos. Depending on the strength of the
UV background field, the amount of cooled gas can be reduced by up to $50\%$ in
systems with circular speeds in the range $80$-$200$ \kms. The magnitude of the
effect, however, is not enough to solve the ``overcooling'' problem that
plagues hierarchical models of galaxy formation if the UV background is chosen
to be consistent with estimates based on recent observations of QSO absorption
systems. Photoionization has little effect on the collapse of gas at high
redshift and affects preferentially gas that is accreted at late times. Since
disks form inside-out, accreting higher angular momentum gas at later times,
disks formed in the presence of a UV background have spins that are even
smaller than those formed in simulations that do not include the effects of
photoionization. This exacerbates the angular momentum problem that afflicts
hierarchical models of disk formation. We conclude that photoionization cannot
provide the heating mechanism required to reconcile hierarchically clustering
models with observations. Energy feedback and enrichment processes from the
formation and evolution of stars must therefore be indispensable ingredients
for any successful model of the formation of disk galaxies.

Ap.J., in press (Oct.10)",,"10.1086/177887","POPe-668","astro-ph",,"  Irregular dust grains are subject to radiative torques when irradiated by
interstellar starlight. It is shown how these radiative torques may be
calculated using the discrete dipole approximation. Calculations are carried
out for one irregular grain geometry, and three different grain sizes. It is
shown that radiative torques can play an important dynamical role in spinup of
interstellar dust grains, resulting in rotation rates which may exceed even
those expected from H_2 formation on the grain surface. Because the radiative
torque on an interstellar grain is determined by the overall grain geometry
rather than merely the state of the grain surface, the resulting superthermal
rotation is expected to be long-lived. By itself, long-lived superthermal
rotation would permit grain alignment by normal paramagnetic dissipation on the
""Davis-Greenstein"" timescale. However, radiative torques arising from
anisotropy of the starlight background can act directly to alter the grain
alignment on much shorter timescales, and are therefore central to the process
of interstellar grain alignment.
  Radiative torques depend strongly on the grain size, measured by a_eff, the
radius of a sphere of equal volume. In diffuse clouds, radiative torques
dominate the torques due to H2 formation for a_eff=0.2micron grains, but are
relatively unimportant for a_eff<0.05micron grains. This may provide a natural
explanation for the observation that $a_eff>0.1 micron grains in diffuse clouds
are aligned, while there is little alignment of a_eff < 0.05 micron grains. We
show that radiative torques are ineffective at producing superthermal rotation
within quiescent dark clouds, but can be very effective in star-forming regions
such as the M17 molecular cloud.

assumptions going into theories of structure formation. We define the concepts
of ``coherent'' and ``incoherent'' fluctuations, and also of ``active'' and
``passive'' fluctuations. In these terms inflationary fluctuations are passive
and coherent while topological defects are active incoherent fluctuations.
Causality and scale invariance are shown to have different implementations in
theories differing in the above senses. We then extend the formalism of Hu and
Sugiyama to treat models with cosmic defects. Using this formalism we show that
the existence or absence of secondary Doppler peaks and the rough placing of
the primary peak are very sensitive to the fundamental properties defined. We
claim therefore that even a rough measurement of the angular power spectrum
$C_l$ shape at $100<l<1500$ ought to tell us which are the basic ingredients to
be used in the right structure formation theory. We also apply our formalism to
cosmic string theories. These are shown to fall into the class of active
incoherent theories for which one can robustly predict the absence of secondary
Doppler peaks. The placing of the cosmic strings' primary peak is more
uncertain, but should fall in $l\approx400-600$.

supports a hybrid evolving dwarf--rich model wherein a large population of

integrated number density of dwarfs (down to M_{B}=-11) is estimated to be a
factor of 20 times greater than that of E---Sc galaxies and the estimated

massive scalar field) provides a fairly non-trivial testing ground for
fundamental problems in quantum cosmology. We provide evidence that the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation admits a basis of solutions that is distinguished by
analyticity properities in a large scale factor expansion. As a consequence,
the space of solutions decomposes in a preferred way into two Hilbert spaces
with positive and negative definite scalar product, respectively. These results
may be viewed as a hint for a deeper significance of analyticity. If a similar
structure exists in full (non-minisuperspace) models as well, severe
implications on the foundations of quantum cosmology are to be expected.
Semiclassically, the elements of the preferred basis describe contracting and
expanding universes with a prescribed value of the matter (scalar field)
energy. Half of the basis elements have previously been constructed by Hawking
and Page in a wormhole context, and they appear in a new light here. The
technical tools to arrive at these conclusions are transformations of the wave
function into several alternative representations that are based on the
harmonic oscillator form of the matter energy operator, and that are called
oscillator, energy and Fock representation. The framework defined by these may
be of some help in analyzing the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for other purposes as
well.

takes on arbitrarily negative values and so the initial singularity in these

spatial topology is that of a torus, with the standard global Killing vectors,

shown that in this class of spacetimes a kind of positive mass theorem holds.

enlarged. Polynomial equations relate the standard deformed Casimir operators
and the new central elements. These relations are important from a physical
point of view since they correspond to relations among quantum expectation
values of observables that have to be satisfied on all physical states. In this
paper, we establish these relations in the case of the quantum Lie superalgebra
U_q(sl(2|1)). In the course of the argument, we find and use a set of
representations such that any relation satisfied on all the representations of
the set is true in U_q(sl(2|1)). This set is a subset of the set of all the
finite dimensional irreducible representations of U_q(sl(2|1)), that we
classify and describe explicitly.
