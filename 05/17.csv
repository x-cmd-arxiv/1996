achieve polarized proton beams in RHIC (250GeV), HERA (820GeV), and the
TEVATRON (900GeV), ideas and techniques new to accelerator physics are needed.
In this publication we will stress an important aspect of very high energy
polarized proton beams, namely the fact that the equilibrium polarization
direction can vary substantially across the beam in the interaction region of a
high energy experiment when no countermeasure is taken. Such a divergence of
the polarization direction would not only diminish the average polarization
available to the particle physics experiment, but it would also make the
polarization involved in each collision analyzed in a detector strongly
dependent on the phase space position of the interacting particle. In order to
analyze and compensate this effect, methods for computing the equilibrium
polarization direction are needed. In this paper we introduce the method of
stroboscopic averaging, which computes this direction in a very efficient way.
Since only tracking data is needed, our method can be implemented easily in
existing spin tracking programs. Several examples demonstrate the importance of
the spin divergence and the applicability of stroboscopic averaging.

conclude that the clusters M5, Palomar 5, M4, NGC 288, NGC 362, NGC 1261, NGC

possible exception of NGC 288 (older by 3.5\pm 1.5 if the reddest NGC 288 HB
stars are on the zero-age horizontal branch). Even with NGC 288 set aside, the
large range in HB morphology in the remaining clusters appears to eliminate age
as the sole second parameter determining HB morphology in the case of constant
mass loss between RGB and HB. We are unable to chose between the two competing
values for M5's (absolute) metallicity: [Fe/H] = -1.40 (Zinn & West 1984) and
-1.17 (Sneden et al. 1992). This level of discrepancy has a signifcant effect
on the derivation of the distance modulus and absolute age of M5. From

chemically pristine population uniformly distributed in the intergalactic

might be present as well. Using extremely high signal-to-noise observations of
a sample of quasars we now show that \ion{C}{4} can be found in 75% of clouds
with $N({\rm H~I}) > 3\ten{14}\cm2$ and more than 90% of those with $N({\rm

narrow range of ionization ratios, spanning less than an order of magnitude in
\ion{C}{4}/\ion{H}{1}, \ion{C}{2}/\ion{C}{4}, \ion{Si}{4}/\ion{C}{4} and
\ion{N}{5}/\ion{C}{4}, and their line widths require that they be photoionized
rather than collisionally ionized. This in turn implies that the systems have a
spread of less than an order of magnitude in both volume density and
metallicity. Carbon is seen to have a typical abundance of very approximately
$10^{-2}$ of solar and Si/C about three times solar, so that the chemical
abundances of these clouds are very similar to those of Galactic halo stars.
\ion{Si}{4}/\ion{C}{4} decreases rapidly with redshift from high values ($>
0.1$) at $z > 3.1$, a circumstance which we interpret as a change in the
ionizing spectrum as the intergalactic medium becomes optically thin to He$^+$\
ionizing photons. Weak clustering is seen in the \ion{C}{4} systems for $\Delta
v < 250\kms$, which we argue provides an upper limit to the clustering of
\ion{H}{1} clouds. If the clouds are associated with galaxies, this requires a
rapid evolution in galaxy clustering between $z = 3$ and $z = 0$.

radio sources fitting the proton blazar model of Mannheim (1993a) to their
observed broad-band spectral energy distributions. At high energies, we use
fluxes or flux limits measured by ROSAT, CGRO and the Whipple Observatory to
constrain their spectra. We take into account absorption of the gamma-rays by
pair production with low energy photons of the diffuse infrared-to-optical
photon background produced by galaxies (cosmic absorption) and with low energy
synchrotron photons of the blazar radiation field (internal absorption).
Typically, the theoretical spectra decrease much faster above TeV (photon index
s~3) than between GeV and TeV (s~2) owing to internal absorption. The predicted
fluxes are confronted with flux limits in the 20-50 TeV energy range obtained
by the High Energy Gamma Ray Astronomy (HEGRA) experiment. Without cosmic
absorption, the fluxes are about equal to the current sensitivity of HEGRA.
Improved gamma/hadron separation techniques could render a detection by HEGRA
possible, if cosmic absorption by the far-infrared background at wavelengths

point is that the gamma-ray absorption by pair production in the intergalactic

results are consistent with the non-detection of bursts by current experiments

because of the 1/2 in the $\Delta$ law, this law leads to a larger value for
the BWL (smaller exponent) than does the $Y$ law. We show that the three-bladed
strong-coupling surfaces, which are infinitesimally thick in the limit of zero
lattice spacing, survive as surfaces to be used in the non-Abelian Stokes'
theorem for the BWL, which we derive, and lead via this Stokes' theorem to the

The existence of this surface was announced in our paper in {\it Bulletin of

full turn of the helicoid, and, like the helicoid, it contains a vertical line.
Modulo vertical translations, it has two parallel horizontal lines crossing the
vertical axis. The nontrivial symmetries of the surface, modulo vertical
translations, consist of: $180^\circ$ rotation about the vertical line;
$180^\circ$ rotation about the horizontal lines (the same symmetry); and their
composition.

scattering off the deuteron is investigated in the region $x \gsim 0.3$. It is
shown that within the spectator mechanism the semi-inclusive cross section
exhibits a scaling property even at moderate values of $Q^2$ ($\sim$ few
$(GeV/c)^2$) accessible at present facilities, like $CEBAF$. Such a scaling
property can be used as a model-independent test of the dominance of the
spectator mechanism itself and provides an interesting tool to investigate the
neutron structure function. The possibility of extracting model-independent
information on the neutron to proton structure function ratio from
semi-inclusive experiments is illustrated. The application of the spectator
scaling to semi-inclusive processes off complex nuclei is outlined.

protocols for bit commitment and coin tossing. However, we, and independently
Mayers, showed that all proposed quantum bit commitment (and therefore coin
tossing) schemes are, in principle, insecure because the sender, Alice, can
always cheat successfully by using an EPR-type of attack and delaying her
measurements. One might wonder if secure quantum bit commitment and coin
tossing protocols exist at all. Here we prove that an EPR-type of attack by
Alice will, in principle, break {\em any} realistic quantum bit commitment and
{\em ideal} coin tossing scheme. Therefore, provided that Alice has a quantum
computer and is capable of storing quantum signals for an arbitrary length of
time, all those schemes are insecure. Since bit commitment and coin tossing are
useful primitives for building up more sophisticated protocols such as
zero-knowledge proofs, our results cast very serious doubt on the security of
quantum cryptography in the so-called ``post-cold-war'' applications.
