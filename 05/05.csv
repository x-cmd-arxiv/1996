modify the properties of atoms and their interaction with radiation. In
particular, the photoionization cross section becomes anisotropic and strongly
polarization dependent. In a number of previous works based on the adiabatic
approximation the conclusion was drawn that the transverse cross section
vanishes for frequencies smaller than the electron cyclotron frequency. In
other works (which employed a different form of the interaction operator)
appreciable finite values were obtained. An adequate interpretation of the
neutron star thermal-like radiation requires a resolution of this controversy.
  In this work the atomic wave functions for both discrete and continuum states
are calculated by solving the coupled channel equations allowing the admixture
between different Landau levels, which provides much higher accuracy than the
adiabatic approximation. This enables to resolve the above contradiction in
favour of the finite transverse cross sections. The non-adiabatic treatment of
the continuum includes coupling between closed and open channels, which leads
to the autoionization of quasi-bound energy levels associated with the electron
cyclotron excitations and gives rise to Beutler - Fano resonances of the
photoionization cross section. Autoionization widths of these quasi-bound
levels are calculated and compared with the radiative widths. The results are
important for investigations of the radiation emergent from the surface layers
of neutron stars.

dynamics with a ``Liouville operator'' $\hL,$ in terms of a {\em nonequilibrium
action functional} for two independent (left and right) trial states. The
method is valid for deterministic or stochastic Markov dynamics, and for
stationary or time-dependent distributions. A practical Rayleigh-Ritz procedure
is advanced, whose inputs are finitely-parametrized ansatz for the trial
states, leading to a ``parametric action'' for their evolution. The
Euler-Lagrange equations of the action principle are Hamiltonian in form
(generally noncanonical). This permits a simple identification of fixed points
as critical points of the parametric Hamiltonian. We also establish a
variational principle for low-order statistics, such as mean values and
correlation functions, by means of {\em least effective action.} The latter is
a functional of the given variable, which is positive and convex as a
consequence of H\""{o}lder realizability inequalities. Its value measures the
``cost'' for a fluctuation from the average to occur and in a weak-noise limit
it reduces to the Onsager-Machlup action. In general, the effective action is
shown to arise from the nonequilibrium action functional by a constrained
variation. This result provides a Rayleigh-Ritz scheme for calculating just the
desired low-order statistics, with internal consistency checks less demanding
than for the full distribution.

similarity and context similarity measures. Words are considered similar if
they appear in similar contexts; contexts are similar if they contain similar

converging process, in which the system learns from the corpus a set of typical
usages for each of the senses of the polysemous word listed in the MRD. A new
instance of a polysemous word is assigned the sense associated with the typical
usage most similar to its context. Experiments show that this method performs
well, and can learn even from very sparse training data.

systems which are modelled by a tight binding Hamiltonian is studied
analytically using the invariant measure method. The approach of Bovier is
generalized to include the possibility of different site energies and nearest
neighbor hopping integrals inside the correlated sites or the cluster. The
process is further elaborated by applying to the symmetric random trimer model
which contains in it many hitherto known models of this category. An
alternative mathematical definition of the exceptional energy ($E_S$) from the
invariant measure density along with physical arguments substantiating it is
presented. Furthermore, the procedure for obtaining exceptional energies is
outlined and applied to the symmetric random trimer model to derive conditions
for obtaining doubly degenerate exceptional energies. The Lyapunov exponent
($\gamma (E)$) or the inverse localization length of states around the
exceptional energy is found to vary as $\sim (E - E_S)^{2n}$ in the leading
order. $n$ denotes the degeneracy of the exceptional energy. The density of
states at the exceptional energies are calculated. We further propose that one
dimensional correlated disordered systems can be mapped to a Lloyd model in
which the width of the distribution of site energies is determined by the
reflection coefficient of the cluster embedded in the lattice of the another
constituent. The importance of our results is discussed.
