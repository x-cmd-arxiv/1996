galaxy formation: The supernova feedback, in conjunction with gasdynamics and
gravity, plays a crucial role in determining how galaxies arise within the
context of a model for large-scale structure. Our treatment incorporates a
multi-phase model of the interstellar medium and includes the effects of
cooling, heating and metal enrichment by supernovae, and evaporation of cold
clouds. The star formation happens inside the clouds of cold gas, which are
produced via thermal instability. We simulate the galaxy formation in standard
biased CDM model for a variety of parameters and for several resolutions in the
range 2--20$h^{-1}$kpc. In our picture, supernova feedback regulates the
evolution of the gas components and star formation. The efficiency of cloud
evaporation by supernova strongly influences star formation rates. This
feedback results in a steady rate of star formation in large galaxies (mass
larger than $2-3x10^{11}\Msun$) at a level of $(1-10)\Msun\yr$ for $z<3$.
Supernova feedback has an even stronger effect on the evolution of dwarf
galaxies, most of which have a small fraction of stars and extremely low
luminosities: $M_R>-15$. In the case of both large and small galaxies, the
distribution of luminous matter (stars) is strongly BIASED with respect to the
dark matter. We find an approximate biasing measure of the form $\rho_{lum}=
(\rho_{dm}/133)^{1.7}$ for z=0 and overdensities exceeding 1000. Deviations
from this relation (a factor 2-3) depend on the environment. For halo masses
exceeding $2x10^{10}\Msun$, the dependence of the absolute magnitude on the
total mass can be approximated as $M_V=-18.5-4\log(M_{tot}/10^{11}\Msun)$, with
a scatter of less than 0.5mag.

Assuming a Maxwellian distribution of kick velocities we derive analytical
expressions for the distribution functions of orbital separations and
eccentricities immediately after the explosion, of orbital separations after
circularization of the post-SN orbits, and of systemic velocities of binaries
that remain bound after the explosion. These distributions of binary
characteristics can be used to perform analytical population synthesis
calculations of various types of binaries, the formation of which involves a
supernova explosion. We study in detail the dependence of the derived
distributions on the kick velocity and the pre-SN characteristics, we identify
all the limits imposed on the post-SN orbital characteristics, and we discuss
their implications for the population of X-ray binaries and double neutron star
systems. We show that large kick velocities do not necessarily result in large
systemic velocities; for typical X-ray binary progenitors the maximum post-SN
systemic velocity is comparable to the relative orbital velocity prior to the
explosion. We also find that, unless accretion-induced collapse is a viable
formation channel, X-ray binaries in globular clusters have most probably been
formed by stellar dynamical interactions only, and not directly from primordial
binaries.

subject to strong modifications due to collective effects in the nuclear

processes operating in the nuclear medium into numerical cooling simulations of
neutron stars. The first process is the modified Urca process, for which the
softening of the pion exchange mode and other polarization effects as well as
the neutrino emission arising from the intermediate reaction states are taken
into account. The second process concerns neutrino emission through superfluid
pair breaking and formation processes. It is found that the medium effects on
the emissivity of the modified Urca process result in a strong density
dependence, which gives a smooth crossover from the standard to the nonstandard
cooling scenario for increasing star masses. For superfluid stars, the
superfluid pair breaking and formation processes accelerate mildly both the
standard and the nonstandard cooling scenario. This leads to a good agreement
between the theoretical cooling tracks and the rather low temperatures observed
for objects like PSRs 0833-45 (Vela), 0656+14, and 0630+18 (Geminga). The
robustness of our findings against variations in both the underlying equation
of state of baryonic matter and the used fast cooling processes is
demonstrated. Hence we conclude that the two recalculated neutrino emissivities
studied here enable one to reproduce theoretically most of the observed pulsar
temperatures by varying the masses of neutron star models.

speculation that these clusters represent present-day analogs of young globular
clusters. Using the HIRES echelle spectrograph on the Keck 10 m telescope, we
obtained high-dispersion optical spectra of one of the ``super star clusters''
(cluster ``A'') in the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 1569. The size of the cluster is
known from published HST images. The line-of-sight velocity dispersion
(15.7+-1.5 km/s) has been measured from a cross-correlation analysis of its
integrated spectrum at visual wavelengths. If the cluster is gravitationally
bound and the velocities are isotropic, application of the virial theorem
implies that the cluster has a total stellar mass of (3.3+-0.5) X 10$^5$ solar
masses. This object's mass, mass density, and probable mass-to-light ratio
after aging 10--15 Gyr are fully consistent with the typical values of Galactic
globular clusters. Our result strongly suggests that at least some of the

indeed evolve into normal globular clusters of the type seen in the Milky Way.

emission-line nuclei have been updated from those given in older surveys.
Consistent with previous studies, it is found that LINERs are extremely common
in the present epoch, comprising approximately 1/3 of all galaxies with B <=
12.5 mag. If all LINERs are nonstellar in origin, then they are the dominant
constituents of the active galactic nucleus population. Many fundamental
characteristics of LINERs closely resemble those of low-luminosity Seyfert
nuclei, although several aspects of their narrow-line regions appear to differ
in a systematic manner. These differences could hold important clues to the key
parameters controlling the ionization level in active nuclei. Lastly, a
substantial fraction of LINERs has been found to contain a broad-line region,
yielding direct evidence, at least in these objects, of a physical link between
LINERs and classical Seyfert 1 nuclei and QSOs.

at $\mu=2 GeV$, are $\mbar=3.4 +- 0.4 +- 0.3 MeV$ and $m_s = 100 +- 21 +- 10

extrapolation in $n_f$ would further reduce these estimates for the physical

impact on the extraction of $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ from the Standard Model. Using

significantly affected due to relatively light sneutrinos which decay
dominantly into invisible channels. In certain cases the second lightest
neutralino may also decay invisibly leading to two extra carriers of missing
energy (in addition to the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP)) -- the
virtual LSPs (VLSPs). It is shown that if the sneutrino masses happen to be in
the small but experimentally allowed range ~ 45 - 55 GeV, these particles
together with neutralino pairs may contribute significantly to the missing
energy in the process e+ e- ---> \gamma + missing energy at LEP-2 energies as
an enhancement over the Standard Model or the conventional MSSM predictions. It
is further shown that a much larger region of the parameter space can be
scanned at a high luminosity e+ e- collider at 500 GeV like the proposed NLC
machine. Moreover this process can play a complementary role to direct chargino
searches at LEP-2 and NLC which may fail due to a near mass degeneracy of the
chargino and the sneutrino. Formulae for the cross sections taking into account
full mixings of the charginos and the neutralinos are derived. The signal
remains observable even in the context of more restricted models based on N=1

coupled-channels transmission matrices, we have found that there is a set of
internal amplitudes which are essentially constant for all even--even actinide
nuclei. These same amplitudes also give good results for the known anisotropic
$\alpha-$particle emission of the favored decays of odd nuclei in the same mass
region.

respect to a Lie subalgebra. Using this techniques in the case of affine Lie
algebras we introduce twisting functors on the categories of modules. These
functors are enumerated by elements of the affine Weyl group corresponding to
the chosen affine Lie algebra and map Verma modules to so called twisted Verma
modules. Applying twisting functors to the BGG resolution of an integrable
simple module we obtain a sequence of complexes called the twisted BGG
resolutions. We show that the twisted BGG resolutions form an inductive system
of complexes. It turns out that the limit complex of the inductive system is
exactly the semi-infinite BGG resolution introduced by B. Feigin and E. Frenkel
and consisting of direct sums of Wakimoto modules.

will concentrate on the *-algebra structure of the quantum double. If the
conjugacy classes in the group are countably separated, then we classify the
irreducible *-representations by using the connection with so-called
transformation group algebras. For finite groups, we will compare our
description to the result of Dijkgraaf, Pasquier and Roche. Finally we will
work out the explicit examples of SU(2) and SL(2,R).

we associate a family of automorphisms of the algebra which act in a natural

the trace that appears in the ordinary character. Twining characters of
integrable highest weight modules and Verma modules satisfy a character formula
which involves a certain subgroup of the Weyl group. This subgroup is shown to
be the Weyl group of another GKM algebra, called the orbit Lie algebra, and
hence the twining characters coincide with ordinary characters of the orbit Lie
algebra.

states of a three-level quantum system in a convenient geometrical manner. The
construction depends on the properties of the group $SU(3)\/$ and its
generators in the defining representation, and uses geometrical objects and
operations in an eight dimensional real Euclidean space. Implications for an
n-level system are also discussed.
