reviewed. The similarities and differences between convection in stellar
envelopes and laboratory convection at high Rayleigh numbers are discussed.
Direct numerical simulation of the solar surface layers, with no other input
than atomic physics, the equations of hydrodynamics and radiative transfer is
now capable of reproducing the observed heat flux, convection velocities,
granulation patterns and line profiles with remarkably accuracy. These results
show that convection in stellar envelopes is an essentially non-local process,
being driven by cooling at the surface. This differs distinctly from the
traditional view of stellar convection in terms of local concepts such as
cascades of eddies in a mean superadiabatic gradient. The consequences this has
for our physical picture of processes in the convective envelope are
illustrated with the problems of sunspot heat flux blocking, the eruption of
magnetic flux from the base of the convection zone, and the Lithium depletion
problem.

with HIRES on the 10m W.M. Keck Telescope. Our analysis focuses on the two
previously identified damped \lya systems found at $z=1.920$ and $z=2.076$. For
each system, we measure accurate abundances. The $z=1.920$ system exhibits the
highest metallicity we have measured for a damped \lya system. We report the
first confident ($>5 \sigma$) detection of Ti in a QSO absorption line system.
By contrast the $z=2.076$ system is the most metal poor we have analyzed,
showing absorption features for only the strongest transitions. We find no
positive evidence for the presence of dust in either system. The two damped
systems exhibit significantly different kinematic characteristics, yet we
contend the two systems are consistent with one physical description: that of a
thick, rotating disk.
  We investigate a very strong Mg II system at $z=0.752$ which is very likely
yet a third damped \lya system. The very weak Mn II and Ti II transitions have
been positively measured and imply $\log \N{HI} > 19.0$. We analyze the
abundance ratios [Mn/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] and their values are inconsistent with
dust depletion, yet consistent with the abundance pattern detected for halo
stars in the Galaxy (see Lu et al. 1996a).
  Finally, we identify a C IV system at $z=2.014$ that shows a very narrow
feature in Si IV and C IV absorption. The corresponding $b$ values (5.5 \kms
and 8.9 \kms for Si IV and C IV) for this component suggest a temperature of
$4.7 \sci{4} \rm K$. Because collisional ionization can explain the observed
abundances only for $T > 8 \sci{4} \rm K$, we contend these ions must have
formed through a different physical process (e.g. photoionization).

asymptotic behavior of the nonperturbative pion wave function $\psi(\k, x)$ at
$x\rightarrow 0,~1, \k \rightarrow \infty$ and 3. The dimensional counting
rules in the intermediate region of energy. The analysis is based on such
general methods as dispersion relations, duality and PCAC. We calculate the
asymptotic behavior of the wave function ($wf$) at the end-point region
($x\rightarrow 1$ and $\k\rightarrow\infty$) by analysing the corresponding
large $n-$th moments in transverse $\la\vec{k}_{\perp}^{2n}\ra \sim n!$ and
longitudinal $\la (2x-1)^n\ra \sim 1/n^2$ directions. This information fixes
the asymptotic behavior of $wf$ at large $\k$ ( which is turned out to be
Gaussian commonly used in the phenomenological analyses). We discuss some
applications of the obtained results. In particular, we calculate the
nonleading ``soft"" contribution to the pion form factor at intermediate
momentum transfer. We argue, that due to the specific properties of $\psi(\k,
x)$, the corresponding contribution can temporarily {\bf simulate} the leading
twist behavior in the extent region of $ Q^2 $. The same effect also takes
place for the nucleon formfactor. Such a mechanism, if it is correct, would be
an explanation of the phenomenological success of the dimensional counting
rules at available, very modest energies for many different processes. We
discuss some inclusive amplitudes also.

$SU(\infty)$ Yang-Mills theory to one temporal dimension. Crucial ingredients
are the exact integrability property of the $3D~SU(\infty)$ continuous Toda
theory and its associated dimensionally-reduced $SU(\infty)$ Toda $molecule$
equation whose symmetry algebra is the $U_\infty$ algebra obtained from a
dimensional-reducion of the $W_\infty \oplus {\bar W}_\infty$ algebras that act
naturally on the original $3D$ continuous Toda theory. The $U_\infty$ algebra
is explicitly constructed in terms of exact quantum solutions of the quantized
continuous Toda equation. Highest weight irreducible representations of the
$W_\infty$ algebras are also studied in detail. Continuous and discrete energy
levels are both found in the spectrum . Other relevant topics are discussed in
the conclusion.

nonperturbative evolution equation is derived which governs its renormalization
group flow. It is invariant under general coordinate transformations and
satisfies modified BRS Ward--Identities. The evolution equation is solved for a
simple truncation of the space of actions. In 2+epsilon dimensions,
nonperturbative corrections to the beta--function of Newton's constant are
derived and its dependence on the cosmological constant is investigated. In 4
dimensions, Einstein gravity is found to be ``antiscreening'', i.e., Newton's
constant increases at large distances.
