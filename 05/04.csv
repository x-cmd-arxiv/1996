  mn.sty and epsf.sty",,"10.1093/mnras/282.3.877",,"astro-ph",,"  It has been proposed that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ might be
measured from geometric effects on large-scale structure. A positive vacuum
density leads to correlation-function contours which are squashed in the radial
direction when calculated assuming a matter-dominated model. We show that this
effect will be somewhat harder to detect than previous calculations have
suggested: the squashing factor is likely to be $<1.3$, given realistic
constraints on the matter contribution to $\Omega$. Moreover, the geometrical
distortion risks being confused with the redshift-space distortions caused by
the peculiar velocities associated with the growth of galaxy clustering. These
depend on the density and bias parameters via the combination $\beta\equiv
\Omega^{0.6}/b$, and we show that the main practical effect of a geometrical
flattening factor $F$ is to simulate gravitational instability with $\beta_{\rm
eff}\simeq 0.5(F-1)$. Nevertheless, with datasets of sufficient size it is
possible to distinguish the two effects; we discuss in detail how this should
be done. New-generation redshift surveys of galaxies and quasars are
potentially capable of detecting a non-zero vacuum density, if it exists at a
cosmologically interesting level.

Pudritz","A Model for the Internal Structure of Molecular Cloud Cores","33 pages, LaTeX with 3 PS figures; ApJ in press (October 1 1996)",,"10.1086/177771",,"astro-ph",,"  We generalize the classic Bonnor-Ebert stability analysis of
pressure-truncated, self-gravitating gas spheres, to include clouds with
arbitrary equations of state. A virial-theorem analysis is also used to
incorporate mean magnetic fields into such structures. The results are applied
to giant molecular clouds (GMCs), and to individual dense cores, with an eye to
accounting for recent observations of the internal velocity-dispersion profiles
of the cores in particular. We argue that GMCs and massive cores are at or near
their critical mass, and that in such a case the size-linewidth and mass-radius
relations between them are only weakly dependent on their internal structures;
any gas equation of state leads to essentially the same relations. We briefly
consider the possibility that molecular clouds can be described by polytropic
pressure-density relations (of either positive or negative index), but show
that these are inconsistent with the apparent gravitational virial equilibrium,
2U + W = 0 of GMCs and of massive cores. This class of models would include
clouds whose nonthermal support comes entirely from Alfven wave pressure. The
simplest model consistent with all the salient features of GMCs and cores is a
``pure logotrope,'' in which P/P_c = 1 + A ln(rho/rho_c). Detailed comparisons
with data are made to estimate the value of A, and an excellent fit to the
observed dependence of velocity dispersion on radius in cores is obtained with
A = 0.2.

  Symposium 174: Dynamical Evolution of Star Clusters",,,"IASSNS AST 96/15","astro-ph",,"  The size of the core is one of the main diagnostics of the evolutionary state
of a globular cluster. Much has been learned over the last few years about the
behavior of the core radius during and after core collapse, under a variety of
different conditions related to the presence or absence of large numbers of
binaries. An overview is presented of the basic physical principles that can be
used to estimate the core radius. Four different situations are discussed, and
expressions are presented for the ratio $r_c/r_h$ of core radius to half mass
radius. The regimes are: deep collapse in the absence of primordial binaries;
steady post-collapse evolution after primordial binaries have been burned up;
chaotic post-collapse evolution under the same conditions; and post-collapse
evolution in the presence of primordial binaries. In addition, modifications to
all of these cases are indicated for the more realistic situation where effects
of the galactic tidal field are taken into account.

giving a unified description of the normal conductor- superconductor (N-S) and
superconductor-superconductor (S-S) cases is presented. It is based on a model
Hamiltonian describing charge transfer processes in the contact region and
makes use of non-equilibrium Green function techniques for the calculation of
the relevant quantities. It is explicitly shown that when calculations are
performed up to infinite order in the coupling between the electrodes, the
theory contains all known results predicted by the more usual scattering
approach for N-S and S-S contacts. For the latter we introduce a specific
formulation for dealing with the non-stationary transport properties. An
efficient algorithm is developed for obtaining the dc and ac current
components, which allows a detailed analysis of the different current-voltage
characteristics for all range of parameters. We finally address the less
understood small bias limit, for which some analytical results can be obtained
within the present formalism. It is shown that four different physical regimes
can be reached in this limit depending on the values of the inelastic
scattering rate and the contact transmission. The behavior of the system in
these regimes is discussed together with the conditions for their experimental
observability.

separation of the Hubbard chain is replaced by a ``$c$'' and ``$s$''
separation. Here $c$ and $s$ refer to small-momentum and low-energy independent
excitation modes which couple both to charge and spin. Importantly, we find the
exact generators of these excitations both in the electronic and pseudoparticle
basis. In the limit of zero magnetic field these generators become the usual
charge and spin fluctuation operators. The $c$ and $s$ elementary excitations
are associated with the $c$ and $s$ pseudoparticles, respectively. We also
study the separate pseudoparticle left and right conservation laws. In the
presence of the magnetic field the small-momentum and low-energy excitations
can be bosonized. However, the suitable bosonization corresponds to the $c$ and
$s$ pseudoparticle modes and not to the usual charge and spin fluctuations. We
evaluate exactly the commutator between the electronic-density operators. Its
spin-dependent factor is in general non diagonal and depends on the
interaction. The associate bosonic commutation relations characterize the
present unconventional low-energy separation.

Ioffe-Larkin approach to the t-J model. We first derive the interaction
parameters of the 2+1 plasma of magnetic monopoles. The total charge along the
time axis is constrained to be zero for each lattice plaquette. Under the
one-plaquette approximation, the problem is equivalent to a one dimensional
neutral plasma interacting via a potential $V(t) \sim t^{\alpha}$, with
$\alpha=1/3$. The plasma is in a dipolar phase if $\alpha \ge 1$ and a
possibility of transition towards a Debye screening phase arises if $\alpha <
1$, so that there exists a critical Fermi wave vector $k_f^{*}$ such as the
plasma is Debye screening if $k_f<k_f^{*}$ and confined if $k_f>k_f^{*}$. The
2+1 dimensional problem is treated numerically. We show that $k_f^{*}$
decreases and goes to zero as the number of colors increases. This suggests
that the assumption of spin-charge decoupling within the slave-boson scheme is
self-consistent at large enough values of $N$ and small enough doping.
Elsewhere, a confining force between spinons and antiholons appears, suggesting
a transition to a Fermi liquid state.

commutative C*-algebra, compact selfadjoint operators acting on the Hilbert
C*-module $H_A$ (= continuous families of such operators $K(x)$, $x\in X$) can
be diagonalized if we pass to a bigger W*-algebra $L^\infty(X)={\bf A} \supset
A$ which can be obtained from $A$ by completing it with respect to the weak
topology. Unlike the ""eigenvectors"", which have coordinates from $\bf A$, the
""eigenvalues"" are continuous, i.e. lie in the C*-algebra $A$. We discuss here
the non-commutative analog of this well-known fact. Here the ""eigenvalues"" are
defined not uniquely but in some cases they can also be taken from the initial
C*-algebra instead of the bigger W*-algebra. We prove here that such is the
case for some continuous fields of real rank zero C*-algebras over a
one-dimensional manifold and give an example of a C*-algebra $A$ for which the
""eigenvalues"" cannot be chosen from $A$, i.e. are discontinuous. The main point
of the proof is connected with a problem on almost commuting operators. We
prove that for some C*-algebras if $h\in A$ is a selfadjoint, $u\in A$ is a
unitary and if the norm of their commutant $[u,h]$ is small enough then one can
connect $u$ with the unity by a path $u(t)$ so that the norm of $[u(t),h]$
would be also small along this path.
