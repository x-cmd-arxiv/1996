the luminosity function turn-over and the metallicity for all these low mass
star samples which matches the expected $M_I$ versus [Fe/H] trend for a model
star of $\approx$ 0.27 M$_{\odot}$ (Saumon 1995; Alexander {\it et al.}\ 1996).
We interpret this smooth and systematic behavior in the cluster luminosity

a metallicity-dependent mass-luminosity relation.

matter have sufficient resolution to show most of the structure at differing
radial velocities of the absorber. In analyzing the lines, however, it is
important to sense and correct for the fact that some parts of a profile may
have some very narrow structures that are saturated and then degraded by the
convolution of the true spectrum by the instrumental profile. This can be done
by comparing at each velocity the apparent optical depths of two lines that
have significantly different transition probabilities. If their ratio is
smaller than the ratio of the lines' values of f(lambda), the actual saturation
is more severe than that indicated by the raw optical depths. This paper
describes a simple procedure for selectively boosting apparent optical depth of
the weaker of the two lines at each velocity value, so that unresolved
saturated structure is accounted for, thus yielding a very nearly correct
answer for the column density per unit velocity. Some test examples that
demonstrate the use of the correction method are given, along with a simple
recipe for invoking it.

analyse the properties of the Narayan, McClintock & Yi (1996) model of
quiescent Soft X-ray Transients in which the cold Keplerian disk has its inner
edge at a large transition radius and transforms to a hot, advection-dominated
flow on the inside. We show that outbursts of transient sources could be
triggered in this model either by a pure thermal accretion disk instability or
by a disk instability generated by an enhanced mass transfer from the stellar
companion. Both mechanisms operate in the outer thin disk and could be at work,
either in different systems or in the same system at different epochs,
depending on the mass transfer rate and the value of the viscosity parameter
$\alpha_t$ of the thin disk. We show that the recurrence time between outbursts
in SXTs can be explained with values of $\alpha_t$ similar to these required by
the dwarf nova disk instability model instead of the unreasonably low values
needed in the model in which the thin disks extends down to the last stable
orbit. We extend the Narayan, McClintock & Yi (1996) model to the case when the

spectrograph on the CTIO 4.0m telescope. A pair of radial velocities (median
precision $\simeq$ 2 km/s) separated by 11 months have been obtained for 33
turnoff dwarfs in the magnitude range 16.9 $\le$ V $\le$ 17.4. Monte-Carlo
simulations have been used to derive a binary fraction, X, for systems with
periods in the range 2 days $\lae {\rm P} \lae$ 3 years and mass ratios between
0.2 and 1.0. This short-period cutoff is more than an order of magnitude
smaller than those of existing radial velocity surveys and is comparable to the
shortest periods possible for main-sequence turnoff stars. Our survey therefore
provides a first glimpse into the abundance of ``ultra-hard"" spectroscopic
binaries in globular clusters. Although no star shows a velocity variation
larger than 14 km/s, two objects are observed to have chi-square probabilities
below 0.1\%. No such stars are expected in a sample of 33. We find a best-fit
binary fraction of X $\simeq$ 0.15, a value which is consistent with recent
estimates based on deep HST color-magnitude diagrams, as well as with the
binary fraction of X $\simeq$ 0.1 for nearby solar-type stars having similar
periods and mass ratios. Our derived binary fraction suggests that exchange
interactions with pre-existing binaries are a plausible means of explaining the
origin of the hierarchical triple system containing the pulsar PSR 1620-26.

members, we have carried out a search for spectroscopic binaries with periods
in the range 0.2 -- 40 years and with mass ratios between 0.1 and 1.0. Although
the velocities for these evolved stars show clear evidence for atmospheric
motions, no star is convincingly found to exhibit a velocity variation greater
than 7 km/s. By comparing the observed velocity variations to those found in a
series of Monte-Carlo simulations, we estimate the cluster binary fraction to
be X = 0.01 (circular orbits) and X = 0.03 (thermal orbits). These results are
to be compared to the corresponding binary fraction of X = 0.12 for nearby
solar-type stars having similar mass ratios and periods. We speculate that both
the relative abundances of short- and long-period binaries in globular clusters
and the large differences in measured binary fractions for clusters with high
binary ionization rates (M22, Omega Cen) compared to those for clusters with
low ionization rates (M71, M4, NGC 3201) point to a frequency-period
distribution in which soft binaries have been disrupted by stellar encounters.
Finally, we note that none of the three CH stars in our survey shows evidence
for velocity variations; this is in stark contrast to field CH stars, virtually
all of which are binaries. We argue that binaries in M22 which have binding
energies similar to field CH stars are unlikely to have been disrupted by
stellar encounters and suggest that the cluster CH stars are otherwise normal
red giants which lie in the carbon-enriched tail of the cluster metallicity

by building neutrino detectors with effective area in excess of 0.01~km$^2$, we
show here that the science dictates 1~km$^2$, or a 1~km$^3$ instrumented

construction of a high-energy neutrino telescope therefore requires a huge
volume of very transparent, deeply buried material such as ocean water or ice,

architecture. The field is immersed in technology in the domain of particle
physics to which many of its research goals are intellectually connected. With
several thousand optical modules the scope of constructing a kilometer-scale

physics of accretion in mind. In Section 1, we briefly discuss the formation,
evolution and detection of black holes. We also discuss the difference of flow
properties around a black hole and a Newtonian star. In Section 2, we present
past and present developments in the study of spherically accreting flows. We
study the properties of Bondi flow with and without radiative transfer. In the
presence of significant angular momentum, which is especially true in a binary
system, matter will be accreted as a thin Keplerian disk. In Section 3, we
discuss a large number of models of these disks including the more popular
standard disk model. We present magnetized disk models as well. Since the
angular momentum is high in these systems, rotational motion is the most
dominant component compared to the radial or the vertical velocity components.
In Section 4, we study thick disk models which are of low angular momentum but
still have no significant radial motion. The accretion rates could be very high
causing the flow to become radiation dominated and the disk to be geometrically
thick. For low accretion rates, ion pressure supported disks are formed. In
Section 5, we extensively discuss the properties of transonic flows which has
with sub-Keplerian angular momentum. In the absence of shock discontinuities,
these sub-Keplerian flows are basically advecting, similar to Bondi flows,
close to the black holes, though far away they match Keplerian or sub-Keplerian
disks. In presence of shocks, the post-shock flow becomes rotation dominated
similar to thick disks. In Section 6, we present results of important numerical
simulations of accretion flows. Significant results from the studies of
evolution of viscous transonic flows are reported. In Section 7, we discuss
some observational evidences of the black hole accretion. We also present a
detailed model of a generalized accretion disk and present its spectra and
compare with observations. In Section 8, we summarize the review and make
concluding remarks.

into a Killing-Cauchy horizon, we compute the renormalized expectation value of
the stress-energy tensor of the quantum field near that horizon in the physical
state which corresponds to the Minkowski vacuum before the collision of the
waves. It is found that for minimally coupled and conformally coupled scalar
fields the respective stress-energy tensors are unbounded in the horizon. The
specific form of the divergences suggests that when the semiclassical Einstein
equations describing the backreaction of the quantum fields on the spacetime
geometry are taken into account, the horizon will acquire a curvature
singularity. Thus the Killing-Cauchy horizon which is known to be unstable
under ``generic"" classical perturbations is also unstable by vacuum
polarization. The calculation is done following the point splitting
regularization technique. The dynamical colliding wave spacetime has four quite
distinct spacetime regions, namely, one flat region, two single plane wave
regions, and one interaction region. Exact mode solutions of the quantum field
equation cannot be found exactly, but the blueshift suffered by the initial
modes in the plane wave and interaction regions makes the use of the WKB
expansion a suitable method of solution. To ensure the correct regularization
of the stress-energy tensor, the initial flat modes propagated into the
interaction region must be given to a rather high adiabatic order of
approximation.

quark itself, could still be hidden below $M_W$. This would typically involve
scalar induced decays of the heavy quark, and could be realized in models with
more than one Higgs doublet, e.g. MSSM. We illustrate such mechanisms with two
Higgs doublet models, the addition of singlet quarks, as well as reconsidering
a fourth family of quarks and leptons. Curiously, the present $R_b$--$R_c$

than the similar principle introduced by Foreman and Magidor. A
characterization of this principle is given in term of sequences of elementary

kappa-Freese-Nation property under the very weak square principle and a weak
variant of the Singular Cardinals Hypothesis.
  A typical application of this characterization shows that under
2^{\aleph_0}<\aleph_\omega and our very weak square for \aleph_\omega, the
partial ordering [omega_\omega]^{<\omega} (ordered by inclusion) has the
aleph_1-Freese-Nation property.

The melting curve simulations were performed with periodic boundary conditions
with cells up to 512 atoms using the ab-initio Variational Induced Breathing
(VIB) model. The melting curve was obtained by computing $% \Delta H_m$ and
$\Delta V_m$ and integrating the Clapeyron equation. Our $% \Delta H_m$ is in
agreement with previous estimates and we obtain a reasonable $\Delta V_m$, but
our melting slope dT/dP (114 K/GPa) is three times greater than that of Zerr
and Boehler [1994] (35 K/GPa), suggesting a problem with the experimental
melting curve, or an indication of exotic, non-ionic behavior of MgO liquid. We
computed $S(q,\omega)$ from simulations of 1000 atom clusters using the
Potential Induced Breathing (PIB) model. A low frequency peak in the dynamical
structure factor $% S(q,\omega)$ arises below the melting point which appears
to be related to the onset of bulk many-atom diffusive exchanges. These
exchanges may help destabilize the crystalline state and be related to
intrinsic crystalline instability suggested in earlier simulations.

information-theoretic description of quantum entanglement. In a consistent
quantum information theory of entanglement, entropies (uncertainties)
conditional on measurement outcomes can be negative, implying that measurement
can be described via unitary, entropy-conserving, interactions, while still
producing randomness in a measurement device. In such a framework, quantum
measurement is not accompanied by a wave-function collapse, or a quantum jump.
The theory is applied to the measurement of incompatible variables, giving rise
to a stronger entropic uncertainty relation than heretofore known. It is also
applied to standard quantum measurement situations such as the Stern-Gerlach
and double-slit experiments to illustrate how randomness, inherent in the
conventional quantum probabilities, arises in a unitary framework. Finally, the
present view clarifies the relationship between classical and quantum concepts.
