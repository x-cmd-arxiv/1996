dominant source of ionization for the interstellar gas is the hard radiation
field associated with the active nucleus. The photon source is generally
external to the clouds being ionized and so the geometrical perspective from
which the gas is observed and the presence and distribution of dust must be
properly accounted for in the diagnostic process. In this paper, we examine the
formation of the three strong lines: CIV$\lambda$1549, Ly$\alpha$ and
CIII]$\lambda$1909 which are often observed in the nuclear and extended
emission from these sources. We find that the observed trends, in particular
the high CIV$\lambda$1549/Ly$\alpha$ ratio, are often better explained by
geometrical (viewing angle) effects than by the presence of large quantities of
dust either within or outside the excited clouds. We show that neutral
condensations along the line-of-sight, by reflecting photons near the
wavelength of Ly$\alpha$, can increase the observed CIV/Ly$\alpha$ ratio. The
existence of HI absorption clouds (i.e., mirrors) external to the emission
region leads also to the presence of large, diffuse haloes of what appears to
be pure, narrow Ly$\alpha$ emission.

minimal frequency of the phonon spectrum and the corresponding generalized
eigenfunction. Using an exact decimation scheme, the eigenfunctions are shown
to have nontrivial scaling properties not only at the pinning transition point
but also in the cantorus regime. Therefore the phonons defy localization and
remain critical even where the associated area-preserving map has a positive
Lyapunov exponent. In this region, the critical scaling properties vary
continuously and are described by a line of renormalization limit cycles.
Interesting renormalization bifurcation diagrams are obtained by monitoring the
cycles as the parameters of the system are varied from an integrable case to
the anti-integrable limit. Both of these limits are described by a trivial
decimation fixed point. Very surprisingly we find additional special parameter
values in the cantorus regime where the renormalization limit cycle degenerates
into the above trivial fixed point. At these ``degeneracy points'' the phonon
hull is represented by an infinite series of step functions. This novel
behavior persists in the extended version of the model containing two
harmonics. Additional richnesses of this extended model are the one to two-hole
transition line, characterized by a divergence in the renormalization cycles,
nonexponentially localized phonons, and the preservation of critical behavior
all the way upto the anti-integrable limit.

spacetime additional scalars are supplied by the components of the Killing
vectors; by using these alongside the spin coefficients and the Riemann tensor
components we have the possibility of constructing the full quota of four
functionally independent zero-weighted scalars, and of exploiting Held's
procedure.
  As an illustration we investigate the vacuum Type N spaces admitting a
Killing vector and a homothetic Killing vector. In a direct manner, we reduce
the problem to a pair of ordinary differential operator `master equations',
making use of a new zero-weighted GHP operator. By first rewriting the master
equations as a closed set of complex first order equations, we reduce the
problem to one real third order operator differential equation for a complex
function of a real variable --- but with still the freedom to choose explicitly
our fourth coordinate. An alternative, more algorithmic approach, using a
closed chain of real first order equations for real functions, reduces the
problem to the same order, but in a more natural and much more concise form. It
is also outlined how the various other third order differential equations,
which have been derived previously by other workers on this problem, can be

and the well-known perturbative QCD correction only. In the forthcoming
asymmetric B-experiments with microvertex detectors, BABAR and BELLE, the total
separation of b --> u semileptonic decays from the dominant b --> c
semileptonic decays would be experimentally viable. We explore the possible
experimental option: the measurement of inclusive hadronic invariant mass
distributions. We also clarify the relevant experimental backgrounds.

equation up to the one-loop order on the basis of the background field method
with the imaginary time formalism. The background field method, which maintains
the explicit gauge invariance, provides notorious simplifications since one has
to calculate only the renormalization constant of the background field gluon
propagator. The results for the evolution of the QCD coupling constant at
finite $T$ reproduce partially the ones obtained in the literature. We discuss,
in particular, the origin of the discrepancies between different calculations,
such as the choice of gauge, the break-down of Lorentz invariance, imaginary
versus real time formalism and the applicability of the Ward identities at
finite $T$.
