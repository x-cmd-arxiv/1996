perpendicular to the relative motion. We examine the influence of the Mach
number of the flow and the strength of the gradient upon the physical behaviour
of the flow and the accretion rates of the angular momentum in particular. The
hydrodynamics is modeled by the ``Piecewise Parabolic Method'' (PPM). The
resolution in the vicinity of the accretor is increased by multiply nesting
several grids around the sphere. Similarly to the 3D models without gradients
published previously, models exhibit non-stationary flow patterns, although the
Mach cone remains fairly stable. The accretion rates of mass, linear and
angular momenta do not fluctuate as strongly as published previously for 2D
models, but similarly to the 2D models, transient disks form around the
accretor that alternate their direction of rotation with time. The average
specific angular momentum accreted is roughly between 7% and 70% of the total
angular momentum available in the accretion cylinder and is always smaller than
the value of a vortex with Kepler velocity around the surface of the accretor.
The fluctuations of the mass accretion rate in the models with small gradients
(2%) are similar to the values of the models without gradients, while the
models with large gradients (20%) exhibit larger fluctuations. The mass
accretion rate is maximal when the specific angular momentum is zero, while the
specific entropy tends to be smaller when the disks are prograde.

interaction of positive and negative energy modes in the co- and

they move in radius and radial wavenumber space - with the result that
amplification of the advected wave is more important than the local growth
rate. For a galaxy of co-rotating stars and counter-rotating stars of
mass-fraction $\xi_* < {1\over 2}$, or of counter-rotating gas of mass-fraction
$\xi_g < {1\over 2}$, the largest amplification is usually for the one-armed

observed continuously with the {\it International Ultraviolet Explorer} (IUE)

for this and other Seyfert galaxies to smaller time scales (i.e., a few days).
The continuum variations in all of the UV bands are {\it simultaneous} to
within an accuracy of about 0.15 days, providing a strict constraint on
continuum models. The emission-line light curves show only one major event
during the continuous monitoring (a slow rise followed by a shallow dip), and

given. During the monitoring period, the continuum at 6925~\AA\ varied by
$\sim$17\% while the continuum at 4600~\AA\ varied by $\sim$35\%, with larger
variations in the near UV. The wavelength dependence of the variation amplitude
also extends into the far UV. The dependence in the 2700$-$7200~\AA\ range can
be explained by the different relative starlight contributions at different
wavelengths, but the large variability at 1275~\AA\ cannot be explained in this
way. The continuum variability timescale is of order 13 days and is similar at
all optical wavelength bands. No evidence for a time lag between the optical
continuum and the UV continuum and emission lines was found. The H$\alpha$
emission line flux varied by about 12\% with a gradual rise throughout the
campaign. Its cross correlation with the continuum light curve gives a lag of
$0-2$ days. The variations in the H$\beta$ emission line flux are about 30\%
and lag the continuum by 0$-$3 days. This is in contrast to past results where
a time lag of 9$\pm$2 days was found for both emission lines. This may be due
to a different variability timescale of the {\em{ionizing}} continuum, or to a
real change in the BLR gas distribution in the 5.5 years interval between the
two campaigns.

time-scale variability. In the softest X-ray bands monitored by {\sl ROSAT}
(0.1--0.4 keV, 0.5--1.0 keV) the source flux remained constant throughout the

variability was evident, the most obvious feature being a marked increase
(factor 1.45) in the count rate over a timescale of $\sim 2$ days commencing
roughly 3 days into the monitoring period. In contrast, only a low amplitude of

the multi-waveband variability and spectral energy distribution of the
Seyfert~1 galaxy NGC~4151 during the December 1993 monitoring campaign. The
source, which was near its peak historical brightness, showed strong,
correlated variability at X-ray, ultraviolet, and optical wavelengths. The
strongest variations were seen in medium energy ($\sim$1.5~keV) X-rays, with a
normalized variability amplitude (NVA) of 24\%. Weaker (NVA = 6\%) variations
(uncorrelated with those at lower energies) were seen at soft $\gamma$-ray
energies of $\sim$100~keV. No significant variability was seen in softer
(0.1--1~keV) X-ray bands. In the ultraviolet/optical regime, the NVA decreased
from 9\% to 1\% as the wavelength increased from 1275~\AA\ to 6900~\AA. These
data do not probe extreme ultraviolet (1200~\AA\ to 0.1~keV) or hard X-ray
(2--50~keV) variability. The phase differences between variations in different
bands were consistent with zero lag, with upper limits of $\ls$0.15~day between
1275~\AA\ and the other ultraviolet bands, $\ls$0.3~day between 1275~\AA\ and
1.5~keV, and $\ls$1~day between 1275~\AA\ and 5125~\AA. These tight limits
represent more than an order of magnitude improvement over those determined in
previous multi-waveband AGN monitoring campaigns. The ultraviolet fluctuation
power spectra showed no evidence for periodicity, but were instead well-fitted

correct UV line blanketing which determines the shape of near-maximum light
supernova spectra. We find that, due to interactions within the multiplets,
treating the background lines as pure scattering (thermalization parameter
$\epsilon = 0$) is a poor approximation and that an overall mean value of
$\epsilon \sim 0.05 - 0.10 $ is a far better approximation. This is true even
in SNe Ia, where the continuum absorption optical depth at 5000 \AA\ ($\equiv
\tau_{\rm std}$) is $<< 1$. We also demonstrate that a detailed treatment of
NLTE effects is required to properly determine the ionization states of both
abundant and trace elements.

prove that at zero molecular diffusivity, or $\kappa = 0$, there exist unique
weak solutions in $L^2\left(\Omega^{\otimes N}\right)$ to the
singular-elliptic, linear PDE's for the stationary $N$-point statistical
correlation functions, when the scalar field is confined to a bounded domain
$\Omega$ with Dirichlet b.c. Under those conditions we prove that the $N$-body
elliptic operators in the $L^2$ spaces have purely discrete, positive spectrum
and a minimum eigenvalue of order $L^{-\gamma}$, with $\gamma =2-\zeta$ and
with $L$ the diameter of $\Omega$. We also prove that the weak $L^2$-limits of
the stationary solutions for positive, $p$th-order hyperdiffusivities
$\kappa_p>0$, $p\geq 1$, exist when $\kappa_p \rightarrow 0$ and coincide with
the unique zero-diffusivity solutions. These results follow from a lower
estimate on the minimum eigenvalue of the $N$-particle eddy-diffusivity matrix,
which is conjectured for general $N$ and proved in detail for $N=2,3,4$. Some
additional issues are discussed: (1) H\""{o}lder regularity of the solutions;
(2) the reconstruction of an invariant probability measure on scalar fields

the diffusion-limited case, analogous to a spinodal decomposition type of
scaling. By comparing $S(q)$ with the pair correlation function between
particles, we were able to identify the peak in the structure factor as arising
from the correlations between particles belonging to nearest-neighbor clusters.
The exponents $a\prime$ and $a\prime \prime$ that relate the position and the
height of the maximum in $S(q)$ vs. time, respectively, were also obtained and
shown to differ somewhat from the spinodal decomposition exponents. We also
found a terminal shape for $S(q)$ that corresponds to a close packing of the
clusters after gelation. Moreover, this picture was shown to be valid in a
concentration range larger than the one suggested in recent experiments.
Although the $S(q)$ for reaction-limited colloid aggregation does not show a
pronounced peak for the earlier times, eventually the peak stretches and
becomes higher than in the diffusion-limited case. The $S(q)$ curves, however,
do not present the scaling shown for diffusion-limited aggregation.

arbitrary, is discussed. Explicit two-loop calculations within the scheme of

that these operators are relevant. In fact, the relevancy increases with the
degree $s$. We argue that this phenomenon in the $O(N)$-model actually reflects
the failure of the perturbative analysis, that is, the
$(2+\epsilon)$-expansion. It is likely that it is necessary to take into
account non-perturbative effects if one wants to describe the phase transition
of the Heisenberg model within the context of the non-linear $\sigma$-model.
Thus, uncritical use of the $(2+\epsilon)$-expansion may be misleading,

simulation requirements at e+e- colliders such as LEP and up-coming linear

GRACE system: a Feynman diagram automatic computation system. The GRACE system
has been used to produce the computational code for all final states, giving a
higher level of confidence in the calculation correctness. Based on the
helicity amplitude calculation technique, all fermion masses can be kept finite
and helicity information can be propagated down to the final state particles.
The phase space integration of the matrix element gives the total and
differential cross sections, then unweighted events are Generated. Initial
state radiation (ISR) corrections are implemented in two ways, one is based on
the electron structure function formalism and the second uses the parton shower
algorithm called QEDPS. The latter can also be applied for final state
radiation (FSR) though the interference with the ISR is not yet taken into
account. Parton shower and hadronization of the final quarks are performed
through an interface to JETSET. Coulomb correction between two intermediate

according to a certain 'local law' which governs their evolution. Both the

assumed to be dynamical variables. We introduce a couple of candidates of such
local laws which, we think, are capable of catalyzing the unfolding of the
network towards increasing complexity and pattern formation. In section 3 the
basis is laid for a version of 'discrete analysis' on 'graphs' and 'networks'
which, starting from different, perhaps more physically oriented principles,
manages to make contact with the much more abstract machinery of Connes et al.
and may complement the latter approach. In section 4 several more advanced
geometric/topological concepts and tools are introduced which allow to study
and classify such irregular structures as (random)graphs and networks. We show
in particular that the systems under study carry in a natural way a 'groupoid
structure'. In section 5 a, as far as we can see, promising concept of
'topological dimension' (or rather: ' fractal dimension') in form of a 'degree
of connectivity' for graphs, networks and the like is developed. The

of plus/minus 0.03 on the value of Delta_s expected to be determined from the
ratio of proton and neutron yields measured by the LSND collaboration. This
error compares favorably with estimates of the SU(3)-breaking uncertainty in
the value of Delta_s extracted from inclusive, polarized deep-inelastic
structure function measurements. We also point out several general features of
the quasielastic neutral current neutrino cross section and compare them with
the analogous features in inclusive, quasielastic electron scattering.

the DBHF fields reproduce the experiment if the configuration dependence is

no physical means for gathering information about the identity of a quantum
system's state (when it is known to be prepared in one of a set of

detectable way. This situation is often mistakenly described as a consequence
of the ``Heisenberg uncertainty principle.'' A more accurate account is that it
is a unique feature of quantum phenomena that rests ultimately on the Hilbert
space structure of the theory along with the fact that time evolutions for
isolated systems are unitary. In this paper I explore several aspects of the
``information / disturbance principle'' in an attempt to make it firmly
quantitative for both pure and mixed states. The final section briefly explores
the extent to which such a principle can be taken as a foundation for unitary
dynamics rather than as a consequence.

paper, is applied to kinetic equations of the Lindblad type for quantum

equilibrium chain of other oscillators having nearest-neighbour interactions.
The kinetic equation is derived without using the so called rotating-wave
approximation. Then it is shown that the classical limit of the corresponding
phase-space equation is independent of the ordering of operators corresponding
to the inverse of the generalized Wigner transformation, provided the latter is
involutive. Moreover, this limit equation, which conserves the probabilistic
nature of the distribution function and obeys an H-theorem, coincides with the
kinetic equation for the corresponding classical system, which is derived
independently and is distinct from that usually obtained in the litterature and
not sharing the above properties. Finally the same formalism is applied to more
general model equations used in quantum optics and it is shown that the above
results remain unaltered.

described in terms of iterations of single step operators or their adjoints.
Based on this, Hamiltonian evolution of processes with associated step
operators $T$ is investigated here. The main limitation of this paper is to
processes which evolve quantum ballistically, i.e. motion restricted to a
collection of nonintersecting or distinct paths on an arbitrary basis. The main
goal of this paper is proof of a theorem which gives necessary and sufficient
conditions that T must satisfy so that there exists a Hamiltonian description
of quantum ballistic evolution for the process, namely, that T is a partial
isometry and is orthogonality preserving and stable on some basis. Simple
examples of quantum ballistic evolution for quantum Turing machines with one
and with more than one type of elementary step are discussed. It is seen that
for nondeterministic machines the basis set can be quite complex with much
entanglement present. It is also proved that, given a step operator T for an
arbitrary deterministic quantum Turing machine, it is decidable if T is stable
and orthogonality preserving, and if quantum ballistic evolution is possible.
The proof fails if T is a step operator for a nondeterministic machine. It is
an open question if such a decision procedure exists for nondeterministic
machines. This problem does not occur in classical mechanics.
