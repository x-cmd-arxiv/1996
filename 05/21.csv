In one-dimensional thin flows, the results of the simulations, with or without
shocks, agree very well with each other and with analytical solutions. In
two-dimensional thick flows, the general features, namely the locations and
strengths of centrifugal and turbulent pressure supported shocks, centrifugal
barriers, and the funnel walls which are expected from analytical models, agree
very well, though the details vary. Generally speaking, the locations of the
shocks may be better obtained by SPH since the angular momentum is strictly
preserved in SPH, but the shocks themselves are better resolved by TVD. The
agreement of these code test results with analytical solutions provides us with
confidence to apply these codes to more complex problems which we will discuss
elsewhere.

have their mass per unit length measured from their thickness in redshift
space. We present preliminary tests of the method and find that it predicts the

~35%. Applying the method to a select region of the Perseus-Pisces supercluster
yields a mass-to-light ratio M/L_B around 460h in solar units to within a
factor of two. The method measures the mass-to-light ratio on length scales of
up to 50h^(-1) Mpc and could thereby yield new information on the behavior of

optically selected AGN is present also in X-ray selected AGN. The relatively
high value obtained for the intrinsic dispersion confirms that in the soft band
AGN are characterized by a variety of spectral indices and the increase with
respect to results obtained from the analysis of Einstein data ($\Delta

distribution as one moves to softer energies. A comparison between the mean

of two-loop order that the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of a strongly
coupled local electron-phonon system is mapped to the two-channel Kondo model.
A phonon is treated as an Einstein oscillator with restricted Hilbert space
such that up to one-phonon process is taken into account. By eliminating the
high energy process of conduction electrons, it is shown that a certain class
of couplings between ion vibrations and conduction electrons is selectively
grown up. As a result the system is reduced to the two-channel Kondo model. The
crossover temperature $T_{\rm K}$ and the renormalized phonon frequency
$\Delta^{x}$ are expressed in terms of the mass ratio $m/M$, $m$ and $M$ being
the mass of electron and ion, and the electron-phonon coupling $g/D$, $D$ being
half the bandwidth of conduction electrons. The anomalous behaviors associated
with this renormalization can be mesuarable if the condition $T_{\rm
K}>\Delta^{x}$ is fulfilled. It is demonstrated that such condition is
satisfied when $g/D$ is sufficiently large but in a realistic range.

diffractive deep-inelastic scattering is measured in terms of a diffractive
structure function $F_2^{D(3)}(\beta,Q^2,\xpom)$ over an extended kinematic
range. The dependence of $F_2^{D(3)}$ on $\xpom$ is found not to depend on
$Q^2$, but to depend on $\beta$. Therefore the $\xpom$ dependence no longer
factorizes. The $Q^2$ and $\beta$ dependence of $F_2^{D(3)}$ is analyzed after
an integration over the dependence on $\xpom$. For fixed $\beta$ a clear rise
with $\log Q^2$ is observed, persisting up to high values of $\beta$. In terms
of the Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) QCD evolution equations, these scaling
violations give clear indications for a gluon dominated process. Subsequently
an attempt is made to quantify the parton content of the diffractive exchange
using the DGLAP evolution. At the starting scale a ``leading'' gluon
distribution is found which contributes about $80 \%$ of the momentum in the
diffractive exchange. Measurements of the hadronic final state (energy flow and
production of $D^{*}$ mesons) are found to be consistent with the predictions
of a model of deep-inelastic electron pomeron scattering using the information

is large (as suggested by the unification of couplings), then the theory is in
a regime best described by the low energy limit of $M$-theory. We discuss some
phenomenological aspects of this view. The scale at which conventional quantum
field theory breaks down is of order the unification scale and consequently
(approximate) discrete symmetries are essential to prevent proton decay. There
are one or more light axions, one of which solves the strong CP problem.
Modular cosmology is still problematic but much more complex than in
perturbative string vacua. We also consider a range of more theoretical issues,
focusing particularly on the question of stabilizing the moduli. We give a
simple, weak coupling derivation of Witten's expression for the dependence of
the coupling constants on the eleven dimensional radius. We discuss the
criteria for the validity of the long wavelength analysis and find that the
""real world"" seems to sit just where this analysis is breaking down. On the
other hand, residual constraints from N=2 supersymmetry make it difficult to
see how the moduli can be stabilized while at the same time yielding a large
hierarchy.

matrix models. We derive and solve the complete sets of loop equations for the
correlators of these models and use these equations to examine critical
behaviour. The topological large-N expansions are also constructed and their
relation to other aspects of modern string theory such as integrable
hierarchies is discussed. We use these connections to discuss the applications
of these matrix models to string theory and induced gauge theories. We argue
that as such the fermionic matrix models may provide a novel generalization of
the discretized random surface representation of quantum gravity in which the
genus sum alternates and the sums over genera for correlators have better
convergence properties than their Hermitian counterparts. We discuss the use of
adjoint fermions instead of adjoint scalars to study induced gauge theories. We
also discuss two classes of dimensionally reduced models, a fermionic vector
model and a supersymmetric matrix model, and discuss their applications to the
branched polymer phase of string theories in target space dimensions D>1 and

sectors of the model. The Wheeler-DeWitt and diffeomorphism constraints are
thereby reduced to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for $SL(2,R)$. The
physical states are shown to live in a well defined Hilbert space and are
manifestly invariant under the full diffeomorphism group. An infinite set of
independent observables \`a la Dirac exists both at the classical and the
quantum level. Using the discrete unitary representations of $SL(2,R)$, we
construct explicit quantum states. However, satisfying the additional
constraints associated with the coset space $SL(2,R)/SO(2)$ requires solutions
based on the principal series representations, which are not yet known. We

$q'$ of the initial and final photon, respectively.
  The model-independent result is expressed in terms of the electromagnetic
form factors of the free nucleon, i.e., on-shell information which one obtains
from electron-nucleon scattering experiments.
  Model-dependent terms appear in the operator at $O(q_\alpha q'_\beta)$,
whereas the orders $O(q_\alpha q_\beta)$ and $O(q'_\alpha q'_\beta)$ are
contained in the low-energy theorem for $\Gamma^{\mu\nu}$, i.e., no new
