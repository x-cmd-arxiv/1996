over 200 faint X-ray sources to a flux limit of S_(0.5-2keV)=4x10^-15 erg s^-1
cm^-2 on 5 deep ROSAT fields. Here we present a spectral analysis of all the
X-ray sources to investigate claims that the average source spectra harden at
faint X-ray flux. From a hardness ratio analysis we confirm that the average
spectra from 0.5-2 keV harden from an equivalent photon index of $\Gamma=2.2$
at S_(0.5-2keV)=1x10^-13 erg s^-1 cm^-2 to $\Gamma=1.7$ below 1x10^-14 erg s^-1
cm^-2. These spectral changes are due to the emergence of an unidentified
source population rather than the class of X-ray QSOs already identified. The
128 QSOs detected so far show no evidence for spectral hardening over this
energy range and retain a mean photon index of $\Gamma=2.2$. Recent work
suggests that many of the remaining unidentified sources are X-ray luminous
galaxies. Taking a subset identified as the most likely galaxy candidates we
find that these show significantly harder spectra than QSOs. The emission line
galaxies in particular show spectra more consistent with the residual X-ray
background, with $\Gamma=1.51 \pm 0.1$ from 0.1-2 keV. Individually the
galaxies appear to be a mixture of absorbed and unabsorbed X-ray sources.
Combined with recent cross-correlation results and work on the source number
count distribution, these results suggest that we may be uncovering the missing
hard component of the cosmic X-ray background.

early-type galaxies. It provides optical and near-infrared colors, and line
indices for 25 absorption lines. It can synthesize single age, single
metallicity stellar populations or follow the galaxy through its evolution from
an initial gas cloud to the present time. The model incorporates the new
isochrones of the Padova group and the latest stellar spectral libraries. The
model has been extensively compared with previous ones in the literature to
establish its accuracy as well as the accuracy of this kind of models in
general.
  Using the evolutionary version of the model we find that we cannot fit the
most metal-rich elliptical galaxies if we keep the IMF constant and do not
allow infall of gas. We do however reproduce the results of Arimoto \& Yoshii
(1986) for the evolution of the gas, and produce colors, and, for the first
time with this type of models, absorption line-strengths. It is in fact
possible to fit the data for the elliptical galaxies by varying the IMF with
time. Our numerical model is in good broad agreement with the analytical
'simple model'. In the present paper we describe the model, and compare a few
key observables with new data for three early-type {\em standard} galaxies.
However the data, as well as our fits, will be discussed in much more detail in
a second paper (Vazdekis {\it et al.} 1996), where some conclusions will be
drawn about elliptical galaxies on the basis of this model.

giant elliptical galaxy caught in the act of galactic cannibalism, a scenario

found to diverge at the critical transverse field strength $\Gamma_c$ for the

above $\Gamma_c$, as is also demonstrated in the accompanying paper by Rieger

and while Griffiths singularity effects are certainly observable in the
paramagnetic phase, the nonlinear susceptibility appears to diverge only rather
close to $\Gamma_c$. These results show that Griffiths singularities remain
persistent in dimensions above one (where they are known to be strong), though
their magnitude decreases monotonically with increasing dimensionality (there
being no Griffiths singularities in the limit of infinite dimensionality).

effective chiral lagrangian for heavy and light mesons describing strong
interactions among effective meson fields as well as their couplings to

terms. The effective theory includes heavy ($Q \bar q$) mesons of both negative

summarize the estimates for the parameters entering the effective lagrangian
and discuss in particular some phenomenologically important couplings, such as
$g_{B^* B \pi}$. The hyperfine splitting of heavy mesons is discussed in
detail. The effective lagrangian allows for the possibility to describe
consistently weak couplings of heavy ($B,\, D$) to light ($\pi,\, \rho, \,

requirement that the light meson momenta should be small, and we discuss how
such limitations can be circumvented through reasonable ansatz on the form
factors. Flavour conserving (e. g. $B^* \to B\, \gamma$) and flavour changing
(e. g. $B \to K^* \, \gamma$) radiative decays provide another field of
applications of effective lagrangians; they are discussed together with their

consistent with the construction of integrable models via Hamiltonian
reduction. In other words: we examine possible non-standard reality conditions
for non-abelian Toda theories. We point out in particular that the usual
restriction to the maximally non-compact form of the algebra is unnecessary,
and we show how relaxing this condition can lead to new real forms of the
resulting W-algebras. Previous results for abelian Toda theories are recovered
as special cases. The construction can be extended straightforwardly to deal
with osp(1|2) embeddings in Lie superalgebras. Two examples are worked out in
detail, one based on a bosonic Lie algebra, the other based on a Lie
superalgebra leading to an action which realizes the N=4 superconformal
algebra.

incompressible electron fluid. On an annular geometry, these excitations have
opposite chiralities on the two edges; thus, the partition function takes the
standard form of rational conformal field theories. In particular, it is
invariant under modular transformations of the toroidal geometry made by the
angular variable and the compact Euclidean time. The Jain series of plateaus
have been described by two types of edge theories: the minimal models of the
W-infinity algebra of quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms, and their
non-minimal version, the theories with U(1)xSU(m) affine algebra. We find
modular invariant partition functions for the latter models. Moreover, we
relate the Wen topological order to the modular transformations and the
Verlinde fusion algebra. We find new, non-diagonal modular invariants which
describe edge theories with extended symmetry algebra; their Hall
conductivities match the experimental values beyond the Jain series.

series of integrable systems. As an example the chain models with $A_n$
symmetry and the related Temperley-Lieb algebraic structures and
representations are discussed. It is shown that corresponding to these $A_n$
symmetric integrable chain models there are exactly solvable stationary

characterization of eigenvectors of a linear operator in a vector space. We
then use our matrix characterization to elaborate several properties of the
fixed point groups of metabelian endomorphisms. In particular, we show that the
rank of the fixed point group of an IA-endomorphism of the free metabelian
group of rank $n \ge 2$ can be either equal to 0, 1, or greater than $(n-1)$
(in particular, it can be infinite). We also point out a connection between
these properties of metabelian IA-endomorphisms and some properties of the
Gassner representation of pure braid groups.
