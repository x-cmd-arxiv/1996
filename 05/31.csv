often observed to have a power-law dependence on wavenumber, $k$, with exponent
close to -2: $S(k)\propto k^{-2}$ over a wide range of scales. I present power
spectral analyses of aircraft lidar measurements of phytoplankton abundance
from scales of 1 to 100 km. A power spectrum $S(k)\propto k^{-2}$ is obtained.
As a model for this observation, I consider a stochastic growth equation where
the rate of change of plankton abundance is determined by turbulent mixing,
modeled as a diffusion process in two dimensions, and exponential growth with a
stochastically variable net growth rate representing a fluctuating environment.
The model predicts a lognormal distribution of abundance and a power spectrum
of horizontal transects $S(k)\propto k^{-1.8}$, close to the observed spectrum.
The model equation predicts that the power spectrum of variations in abundance
in time at a point in space is $S(f)\propto f^{-1.5}$ (where $f$ is the
frequency). Time series analysis of local variations of phytoplankton and
zooplankton yield a power-law power spectrum with exponents -1.3 and -1.2,
respectively from time scales of one hour to one year. These values are roughly
consistent with the model prediction of -1.5. The distribution of abundances is
nearly lognormal as predicted. The model may be more generally applicable than
for the spatial distribution of plankton. I relate the model predictions to
observations of spatial patchiness in vegetation.

dynamics of gravitational clustering in cosmology. It states that on
sufficiently small scales the mean pair velocity approaches zero, or
equivalently, that the mean number of neighbours of a particle remains constant
in time at a given physical separation. In this paper we use N-body simulations
of scale free spectra P(k) \propto k^n with -2 \leq n \leq 0 and of the CDM
spectrum to test for stable clustering using the time evolution and shape of
the correlation function \xi(x,t), and the mean pair velocity on small scales.
For all spectra the results are consistent with the stable clustering
predictions on the smallest scales probed, x < 0.07 x_{nl}(t), where x_{nl}(t)
is the correlation length. The measured stable clustering regime corresponds to
a typical range of 200 \lsim \xi \lsim 2000, though spectra with more small
scale power approach the stable clustering asymptote at larger values of \xi.
  We test the amplitude of \xi predicted by the analytical model of Sheth \&
Jain (1996), and find agreement to within 20\% in the stable clustering regime
for nearly all spectra. For the CDM spectrum the nonlinear \xi is accurately
approximated by this model with n \simeq -2 on physical scales \lsim 100-300
h^{-1} kpc for \sigma_8 = 0.5-1, and on smaller scales at earlier times. The
growth of \xi for CDM-like models is discussed in the context of a power law
parameterization often used to describe galaxy clustering at high redshifts.
The growth parameter \epsilon is computed as a function of time and length
scale, and found to be larger than 1 in the moderately nonlinear regime -- thus
the growth of \xi is much faster on scales of interest than is commonly
assumed.

It should be noted that a finite $\overline u - \overline d$ distribution is
theoretically possible in nuclei even if the sea is symmetric in the nucleon.
In neutron-excess nuclei such as the tungsten, there exist more $d$-valence
quarks than $u$-valence quarks, so that more $\overline d$-quarks are lost than
$\overline u$-quarks due to parton recombinations. Our results suggest that the
nuclear modification in the tungsten is a 2--10 \% effect on the NMC $\overline

sector supersymmetry is realized quantum mechanically, so that both tree-level

constraints. We also discuss the physical interpretation of the resulting
target space geometry in terms of configurations of a $2+2$-dimensional object
propagating in a $10+2$-dimensional spacetime with a null isometry, which has
recently been suggested as a unified description of string and M theory.

number of BPS string states at weak coupling whose macroscopic momentum
distribution agrees with that of the black string. It is shown that the number
of such states is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black string

``gravitational quantum cohomology'' by studying topological sigma models
coupled to two-dimensional gravity. We first consider sigma models defined on a
general Fano manifold $M$ (manifold with a positive first Chern class) and
derive new recursion relations for its two point functions. We then derive
bi-Hamiltonian structures of the theories and show that they are completely
integrable at least at the level of genus $0$. We next consider the subspace of
the phase space where only a marginal perturbation (with a parameter $t$) is
turned on and construct Lax operators (superpotentials) $L$ whose residue
integrals reproduce correlation functions. In the case of $M=CP^N$ the Lax
operator is given by $L= Z_1+Z_2+\cdots +Z_N+e^tZ_1^{-1}Z_2^{-1}\cdots
Z_N^{-1}$ and agrees with the potential of the affine Toda theory of the $A_N$
type. We also obtain Lax operators for various Fano manifolds; Grassmannians,
rational surfaces etc. In these examples the number of variables of the Lax
operators is the same as the dimension of the original manifold. Our result
shows that Fano manifolds exhibit a new type of mirror phenomenon where mirror
partner is a non-compact Calabi-Yau manifold of the type of an algebraic torus
$C^{*N}$ equipped with a specific superpotential.

It is found to be a boundary term depending only on the gauge field and, hence,
is independent of the matter sector to which the Chern-Simons term couples.
Addition of the Maxwell term does not alter the fractional spin.

exchange of an effective sigma and delta meson, with parameters close to the
ones used in one-boson-exchange models that fit $NN$ data below the pion
production threshold.

power and particle production in heavy systems at SPS and RHIC energies. This
framework bridges with one model consistently the entire available range of
energies from below SIS to CERN, even for the heaviest system Pb+Pb. URQMD is a
hadronic transport model based on the propagation of hadrons on classical
trajectories in the framework of Lorentz-invariant dynamics. It includes
secondary interactions e.g. annihilation of produced mesons leading to the
formation of resonances and the excitation of strings. The collision term
contains 50 different baryon species (including nucleon, delta and hyperon
resonances with masses up to 2 GeV) and 25 different meson species (including
strange meson resonances), which are supplemented by their corresponding
antiparticle and all isospin-projected states. Within this approach we find no
gap in the baryon rapidity distribution even at RHIC. For CERN (SPS) energies
URQMD shows a pile up of baryons and a supression of multi-nucleon clusters
(e.g. He) at midrapidity.

can occur, they will not persist in time and that eventually only compatible
results will be obtained. The probabilities of particular results, however,
will in general not agree with the predictions of quantum theory. We argue that
it is unlikely that the deviations would have been seen in any experiment yet
