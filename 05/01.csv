  issue, Vol. 470","Astrophys.J. 470 (1996) 706","10.1086/177901",,"astro-ph",,"  Two new methods are proposed for linear regression analysis for data with
measurement errors. Both methods are designed to accommodate intrinsic scatter
in addition to measurement errors. The first (BCES) is a direct extension of
the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator to allow for measurement errors. It
is quite general, allowing a) for measurement errors on both variables, b) the
measurement errors for the two variables to be dependent, c) the magnitudes of
the measurement errors to depend on the measurements, and d) other `symmetric'
lines such as the bisector and the orthogonal regression can be constructed.
The second method is a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator, which applies
only in the case where the `independent' variable is measured without error and
the magnitudes of the measurement errors on the 'dependent' variable are
independent from the measurements. Several applications are made to
extragalactic astronomy: The BCES method, when applied to data describing the
color-luminosity relations for field galaxies, yields significantly different
slopes than OLS and other estimators used in the literature. Simulations with
artificial data sets are used to evaluate the small sample performance of the
estimators. Unsurprisingly, the least-biased results are obtained when color is
treated as the dependent variable. The Tully-Fisher relation is another example
where the BCES method should be used because errors in luminosity and velocity
are correlated due to inclination corrections. We also find, via simulations,
that the WLS method is by far the best method for the Tolman surface-brightness
test, producing the smallest variance in slope by an order of magnitude.
Moreover, with WLS it is not necessary to ``reduce'' galaxies to a fiducial
surface-brightness, since this model incorporates intrinsic scatter.

the system exhibits post-collapse oscillations they turn out to be directly
binary driven and we cannot prove the existence of a gravothermal expansion at

that it can move inward with roughly the free-fall velocity. Although
disturbances continue to be present, the global disk structure will not be
modified largely. This can account for persistent hard X-ray emission with
substantial variations observed in active galactic nuclei and stellar black
hole candidates during the hard state. Moreover, when the disturbance reaches
the innermost parts, an acoustic wave emerges, propagating outward as a shock

ultra-relativistic particles in an expanding fireball. The kinetic energy of
the particles is converted into thermal energy in a forward shock and a reverse
shock, when the outward flowing particles encounter the interstellar medium.
The thermal energy is radiated via synchrotron emission and Comptonization. We
estimate the synchrotron cooling time scale of the shocked regions for
electrons of various Lorentz factors, focusing in particular on those electrons
whose radiation falls within the energy detection range of the BATSE detectors.
We find that in order to produce the rapid variability observed in most bursts
the magnetic energy density in the shocked material must be greater than about
1\% of the thermal energy density. Additionally, the electrons must be nearly
in equipartition with the protons, otherwise the radiative efficiency is low.
Inverse Compton scattering can increase the cooling rate of the relevant
electrons but the Comptonized emission itself is never within the BATSE range.
These arguments allow us to pinpoint the conditions within the radiating
regions in GRBs and to determine the important radiation processes. In
addition, the model predicts that the duty cycle of intensity variations in GRB
light curves should be nearly independent of burst duration, and should scale
inversely as the square root of the observed photon energy. Both correlations
are in agreement with observations. The model also provides a plausible
explanation for the bimodal distribution of burst durations. There is no
explanation, however, for the characteristic break energy in GRB spectra.

porosity distributions for a two-dimensional plane-section through the medium
are generally different. However, for homogeneous and isotropic media having
finite correlation-lengths, a good degree of correspondence between the two
sets of local porosity distributions can be obtained by rescaling lengths, and
the mapping associating corresponding distributions can be found from
two-dimensional observations alone. The agreement between associated
distributions is good as long as the linear extent of the measurement cells
involved is somewhat larger than the correlation length, and it improves as the
linear extent increases. A simple application of the central limit theorem
shows that there must be a correspondence in the limit of very large
measurement cells, because the distributions from both sets approach normal
distributions. A normal distribution has two independent parameters: the mean
and the variance. If the sample is large enough, LPDs from both sets will have
the same mean. Therefore corresponding distributions are found by matching
variances of two- and three-dimensional local porosity distributions. The
variance can be independently determined from correlation functions. Equating
variances leads to a scaling relation for lengths in this limit. Three
particular systems are examined in order to show that this scaling behavior
persists at smaller length-scales.

uncertainty in the world: the planner has full knowledge of the conditions
under which the plan will be executed and the outcome of every action is fully
predictable. These planners cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e.,
plans in which different actions are performed in different circumstances. In
this paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and
construction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a partial-order
contingency planner. Cassandra uses explicit decision-steps that enable the
agent executing the plan to decide which plan branch to follow. The
decision-steps in a plan result in subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are
planned for in the same way as any other subgoals. Cassandra thus distinguishes
the process of gathering information from the process of making decisions. The
explicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent approach to
the problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid base for extensions
such as the use of different decision-making procedures.

identical to the Chiral quark soliton model obtained from the instanton liquid
model of the QCD vacuum. In this non-linear model, a wide variety of

in particular, electromagnetic, axial, pseudoscalar and pion nucleon form

accomodated by using an explicitly nonassociative theory of octonionic fields.
It is found that the dynamics of this theory is simplified if the Lagrangian
contains only dyonic charges, but certain problems in the constrained
quantisation remain. The extension of these concepts to string theory may
however resolve these difficulties.

of the SM is shown within the NCG framework. This framework, plus standard
renormalization technique at the one-loop level, suggest that the Higgs and top

(e,e'p) reaction a promising tool for investigating new aspects of the
electromagnetic interaction. To this purpose it is crucial to set the scale of
Final-State Interactions (FSI) at high ejectile energies. We have analyzed the
constraints which allow for a meaningful generalization to (e,e'p) of the
Glauber method used in elastic (p,p) scattering. The FSI dominance at large
deflection angles produces in the distributions a universal behaviour
resembling the coherent diffractive scattering between the ejected proton and
the (residual) nucleus. It is argued that the comparison between (e,e'p) and
(p,p), when a meaningful one, may represent a convenient tool to disentangle
(exotic) effects due to FSI from those related to the (hard) electromagnetic
vertex.

element between single-particle states in heavy nuclei, $\sim 100$ eV, is ruled
out by measurements of parity nonconservation in atoms. Experimental upper
limit on the electric dipole moment of the $^{199}$Hg atom strictly constrains
parameters of $CP$-violation models. Upper limit on the $T$-odd, $P$-even

nucleon properties under rescaling of the parameters describing the effective
meson theory. In particular we investigate the question of whether the
Brown--Rho scaling laws are general features of such models. When going beyond
the simple Skyrme model we find that restrictive constraints need to be imposed
on the mesonic parameters in order to maintain these scaling laws. Furthermore,
in the case when vector mesons are included in the model it turns out that the
isoscalar form factor no longer scales according to these laws. Finally we note
that, in addition to the exact scaling laws of the model, one may construct
approximate {\it local scaling laws}, which depend of the particular choice of
Lagrangian parameters.

equivalent potentials corresponding to deformed anharmonic oscillators of
SU$_q$(1,1) symmetry, which have been used for the description of vibrational
spectra of diatomic molecules. This connection allows for the immediate
approximate determination of the levels of the same parity lying above the
lowest $n+1$ known levels, as well as of all levels of the opposite parity.
Such connections are not possible in the cases of the q-deformed oscillator,
the Q-deformed oscillator, and the modified P\""oschl-Teller potential with
