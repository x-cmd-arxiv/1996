ellipticity and orientation of clusters of galaxies in N-body simulations of
differing power-law initial spectra (P(k) \propto k^n ,n = +1, 0, -1, -2$), and
density parameters ($\Omega_0 = 0.2$ to 1.0). Furthermore, unlike most
theoretical studies we mimic most observers by removing all particles which lie
at distances greater than 2 1/h Mpc from the cluster center of mass.
  We computed the axial ratio and the principal axes using the inertia tensor
of each cluster. The mean ellipticity of clusters increases strongly with
increasing $n$. We also find that clusters tend to become more spherical at
smaller radii.
  We compared the orientation of a cluster to the orientation of neighboring
clusters as a function of distance (correlation). In addition, we considered
whether a cluster's major axis tends to lie along the line connecting it to a
neighboring cluster, as a function of distance (alignment). Both alignments and
correlations were computed in three dimensions and in projection to mimic
observational surveys. Our results show that significant alignments exist for
all spectra at small separations ($D < 15 h^{-1}$ Mpc) but drops off at larger
distance in a strongly $n-$dependent way.

the evolutionary tracks, whereas the cooler stars show lower surface gravities
than theoretically expected. This agrees with earlier findings by Moehler et

the atmospheric parameters and the cluster distance leads to a mean mass of the
sdB stars of 0.50 M0 and a standard deviation of about 0.043 dex, which is
below the value derived of the observational errors and thus consistent with a
very narrow mass distribution. The mean mass is in good agreement with the

equation and the Lai-Das Sarma equation) and related atomistic models of
epitaxial growth have a generic instability in which isolated pillars (or
grooves) on an otherwise flat interface grow in time when their height (or
depth) exceeds a critical value. Depending on the details of the model, the
instability found in the discretized version may or may not be present in the
truly continuum growth equation, indicating that the behavior of discretized
nonlinear growth equations may be very different from that of their continuum
counterparts. This instability can be controlled either by the introduction of
higher-order nonlinear terms with appropriate coefficients or by restricting
the growth of pillars (or grooves) by other means. A number of such
``controlled instability'' models are studied by simulation. For appropriate
choice of the parameters used for controlling the instability, these models
exhibit intermittent behavior, characterized by multiexponent scaling of height
fluctuations, over the time interval during which the instability is active.
The behavior found in this regime is very similar to the ``turbulent'' behavior
observed in recent simulations of several one- and two-dimensional atomistic
models of epitaxial growth. [pacs{61.50.Cj, 68.55.Bd, 05.70.Ln, 64.60.Ht}]

  May 20-24, 1996",,,"University of Maryland preprint 96-114","gr-qc",,"  In the spirit of Sakharov's `metric elasticity' proposal, we draw a loose
analogy between general relativity and the hydrodynamic state of a quantum gas.
In the `top-down' approach, we examine the various conditions which underlie
the transition from some candidate theory of quantum gravity to general
relativity. Our emphasis here is more on the `bottom-up' approach, where one
starts with the semiclassical theory of gravity and examines how it is modified
by graviton and quantum field excitations near and above the Planck scale. We
mention three aspects based on our recent findings: 1) Emergence of stochastic
behavior of spacetime and matter fields depicted by an Einstein-Langevin
equation. The backreaction of quantum fields on the classical background
spacetime manifests as a fluctuation-dissipation relation. 2) Manifestation of
stochastic behavior in effective theories below the threshold arising from
excitations above. The implication for general relativity is that such
Planckian effects, though exponentially suppressed, is in principle detectable
at sub-Planckian energies. 3) Decoherence of correlation histories and quantum
to classical transition. From Gell-Mann and Hartle's observation that the
hydrodynamic variables which obey conservation laws are most readily decohered,
one can, in the spirit of Wheeler, view the conserved Bianchi identity obeyed
by the Einstein tensor as an indication that general relativity is a
hydrodynamic theory of geometry. Many outstanding issues surrounding the
transition to general relativity are of a nature similar to hydrodynamics and
mesoscopic physics.

Barut-Zanghi (BZ) classical theory for the relativistic extended-like electron,
that relates spin to zitterbewegung (zbw). The BZ motion equations constituted
the starting point for recent works about spin and electron structure,
co-authored by us, which adopted the Clifford algebra language. This language
results to be actually suited and fruitful for a hydrodynamical re-formulation
of the BZ theory. Working out, in such a way, a ``probabilistic fluid'', we are
allowed to re-interpret the original classical spinors as quantum
wave-functions for the electron. Thus, we can pass to ``quantize"" the BZ theory
employing this time the tensorial language, more popular in first-quantization.
``Quantizing'' the BZ theory, however, does not lead to the Dirac equation, but
rather to a non-linear, Dirac--like equation, which can be regarded as the
actual ``quantum limit'' of the BZ classical theory. Moreover, an original
variational approach to the the BZ probabilistic fluid shows that it is a
typical ``Weyssenhoff fluid'', while the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (linking
together mass, spin and zbw frequency) appears to be nothing but a special case
of de Broglie's famous energy-frequency relation. Finally, after having
discussed the remarkable correlation between the gauge transformation U(1) and
a general rotation on the spin plan, we clarify and comment on the
two-valuedness nature of the fermionic wave-function, and on the parity and
charge conjugation transformations.

quantities employed in the applications of Clifford Algebras to quantum
mechanics, we introduce --in terms of the ordinary tensorial framework-- a new
definition for the field of a generic quantity. By translating from Clifford
into tensor algebra, we also propose a new (non-relativistic) velocity operator
for a spin 1/2 particle. This operator is the sum of the ordinary part p/m
describing the mean motion (the motion of the center-of-mass), and of a second
part associated with the so-called zitterbewegung, which is the spin
``internal'' motion observed in the center-of-mass frame. This spin component
of the velocity operator is non-zero not only in the Pauli theoretical
framework, i.e. in presence of external magnetic fields and spin precession,
but also in the Schroedinger case, when the wave-function is a spin eigenstate.
In the latter case, one gets a decomposition of the velocity field for the
Madelung fluid into two distinct parts: which constitutes the non-relativistic
analogue of the Gordon decomposition for the Dirac current. We find furthermore
that the zitterbewegung motion involves a velocity field which is solenoidal,
and that the local angular velocity is parallel to the spin vector. In presence
of a non-constant spin vector (Pauli case) we have, besides the component
normal to spin present even in the Schroedinger theory, also a component of the
local velocity which is parallel to the rotor of the spin vector.
