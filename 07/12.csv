and a network of $1.5-2$ m follow-up telescopes capable of monitoring stars in

originate in the same cosmological objects producing $\gamma$-ray bursts. This
model requires the presence of intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF) to delay
the arrival times of $\sim 10^{20}$ eV CRs by 50 years or longer relative to
the $\gamma$-rays, of an amplitude that is consistent with other observational
constraints. Sources of CRs coming from individual bursts should be resolved
with the planned ``Auger'' experiment, with as many as hundreds of CRs for the
brightest sources. We analyze here the apparent angular and energy distribution
of CRs from bright sources below the pion production threshold (in the energy
range $10^{19}{\rm eV} < E < 4\times10^{19}{\rm eV}$) expected in this model.
This observable distribution depends on the structure of the IGMF: the apparent
spectral width $\Delta E$ is small, $\Delta E/E\lesssim1\%$, if the
intergalactic field correlation length $\lambda$ is much larger than $1{\rm
Mpc}$, and large, $\Delta E/E=0.3$, in the opposite limit $\lambda\ll 1{\rm
Mpc}$. The apparent angular size is also larger for smaller $\lambda$. If the
sources of CRs we predict are found, they will corroborate the bursting model
and they will provide us with a technique to investigate the structure of the
IGMF.

\lcdm\ with $\Omega_0 \sim 0.3$ has the possible virtue of allowing a higher

too much fluctuation power on small scales. CHDM has less power on small

galaxy formation to be compatible with the latest high-redshift data. Also, two

$\Omega=1$ models such as CHDM over \lcdm\ --- (1) the positive deceleration

Depending on parameters, it is possible to obtain $\Omega_{nl} = 1$ at the

this process is stochastic, and ensemble averaging is needed in order to define
multifractal dimensions. In an earlier work [T. C. Halsey and M. Leibig, Phys.
Rev. A46, 7793 (1992)], annealed average dimensions were computed for this
model. In this paper, we compute the quenched average dimensions, which are
expected to apply to typical members of the ensemble. We develop a perturbative
expansion for the average of the logarithm of the multifractal partition
function; the leading and sub-leading divergent terms in this expansion are
then resummed to all orders. The result is that in the limit where the number
of particles n -> \infty, the quenched and annealed dimensions are {\it
identical}; however, the attainment of this limit requires enormous values of
n. At smaller, more realistic values of n, the apparent quenched dimensions
differ from the annealed dimensions. We interpret these results to mean that
while multifractality as an ensemble property of random branched growth (and
hence of DLA) is quite robust, it subtly fails for typical members of the

The event horizon remains intact. On the other hand, strong cosmic censorship
does appear to be violated in this spacetime: For a certain range of
parameters, we find evidence that the inner horizon is classically stable.

a much lower scale, as well as a growing appreciation of the supersymmetric
flavor problem has reopened this question. After reviewing some ideas for
understanding the microscopic origin of the soft breaking parameters in the
context of string theory, I turn to low energy breaking. Independent of the
details of the underlying theory, events with photons and missing energy, like
the CDF $e^+e^-\gamma \gamma \not{E}_T$ event, are likely signals of low energy
breaking. I briefly review the predictions of the simplest model of low energy
supersymmetry breaking for the soft breaking parameters (MGM), and then ask
what sorts of generalizations are possible. It turns out that if all couplings

supersymmetry breaking scenarios. I investigate how low energy dynamical SUSY
breaking may arise from superstring models. In a three generation string
derived model I propose that the unbroken hidden non--Abelian gauge group at
the string scale is $SU(3)_H$ with matter multiplets. Due to the small gauge
content of the hidden gauge group the supersymmetry breaking scale may be
consistent with the dynamical SUSY breaking scenarios. The messenger states are
obtained in the superstring model from sectors which arise due to the
``Wilson--line'' breaking of the unifying non--Abelian gauge symmetry. An
important property of the string motivated messenger states is the absence of
superpotential terms with the Standard Model states. The stringy symmetries
therefore forbid the flavor changing processes which may arise due to couplings
between the messenger sector states and the Standard Model states. Motivated
from the problem of string gauge coupling unification I contemplate a scenario
in which the messenger sector consists solely of color triplets. This
hypothesis predicts a chargino mass below the $W$--boson mass. Imposing the
current limits from the LEP1 and LEP1.5 experiments the lightest supersymmetric
particles predicted by this hypothesis are in the mass ranges
$M_{\chi^\pm}\approx55-65$ GeV, $M_{\chi^0}\approx35-50$ GeV and
$M_{\tilde\nu}\approx45-60$ GeV which will be tested in the forthcoming LEP2

CERN with polarized targets provide a model-independent and
solution-independent evidence for a narrow scalar state sigma(750). The
original chi^2 minimization method and the recent Monte Carlo method for
amplitude analysis of data at 17.2 GeV/c are in excellent agreement. Both
methods find that the mass distribution of the measured amplitude $|\overline S
|^2\Sigma$ with recoil transversity ``up'' resonates near 750 MeV while the
amplitude $|S|^2\Sigma$ with recoil transversity ``down'' is large and
nonresonating. The amplitude $|S|^2\Sigma$ contributes as a strong background
to S-wave intensity I_S = (|S|^2 + |\overline S |^2)\Sigma$ and distorts the
determinations of $\sigma$ resonance parameters from $I_S$. To avoid this
problem we perform a series of Breit-Wigner fits directly to the measured
distribution $|\overline S |^2\Sigma$. The inclusion of various backgrounds
causes the width of sigma(750) to become very narrow. Our best fit with
$t$-averaged coherent background yields $m_\sigma = 753 \pm 19$ MeV and
$\Gamma_\sigma = 108 \pm 53$ MeV. These values are in excellent agreement with
Ellis-Lanik theorem for the width of scalar gluonium. The gluonium
interpretation of $\sigma(750)$ is also supported by the absence of
$\sigma(750)$ in reactions $\gamma\gamma \to \pi\pi$. We also show how data on
polarized target invalidate essential assumptions of past determinations of

symmetry and the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism for generating the fermion Yukawa
couplings. Supersymmetry breaking radiatively induces a vacuum expectation
value for a scalar field, which generates invariant masses for the
Froggatt-Nielsen fields at $M_F \approx 10^4$ GeV. `Flavon' fields $\varphi$,
which spontaneously break the flavor symmetry, naturally acquire negative
squared masses due to two-loop diagrams involving the Froggatt-Nielsen fields,
and acquire vacuum expectation values of order $\langle \varphi \rangle \approx
M_F/16\pi^2$. The fermion mass hierarchy arises in our framework as a power
series in the ratio $\langle \varphi \rangle / M_F \approx 1/16\pi^2$.

$m_c/m_b$ and assuming factorization and saturation by narrow resonances $(N_c

$\xi^{(n)}(w)$ and $\tau^{(n)}_{1/2}(w)$ and the decay constants $f^{(n)}$,
$f^{(n)}_{1/2}$ ($n$ stands for any radial excitation). Alternatively, we
deduce the sum rules with another method free of the factorization hypothesis,
from the saturation of the expectation value of a product of two currents by
heavy hadrons and by the corresponding free quarks. The sum rules read
$\sum\limits_{n}{f^{(n)} \over f^{(0)}} \xi^{(n)}(w) = 2
\sum\limits_{n}{f^{(n)}_{1/2} \over f^{(0)}} \tau^{(n)}_{1/2}(w) = 1$, valid

0$. As a consequence, unlike the BIW sum rule, the slope of the elastic
function $\xi (w)$ is related to radial excitations alone. These are
generalizations, rigorous for QCD in the heavy quark limit, of results that
have an easy understanding in the non-relativistic quark model.

Extending previous results the two-time Hamiltonian formulation is obtained,
which describes the complete phase space of the model in the isomonodromic
sector. The Dirac brackets arising from the coset constraints are calculated.
Their quantization allows to relate exact solutions of the corresponding
Wheeler-DeWitt equations to solutions of a modified (Coset)
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov system. On the classical level, a set of observables is
identified, that is complete for essential sectors of the theory. Quantum
counterparts of these observables and their algebraic structure are
investigated. Their status in alternative quantization procedures is discussed,
employing the link with Hamiltonian Chern-Simons theory.

of the critical current as a function of the applied voltage due to charge
modulation in the bicrystal junction. The experimental data agree with the

modulation of the density by the field.
