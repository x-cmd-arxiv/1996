rules for correlations of velocity differences when all the separation are in
the inertial interval. Using this we consider the standard hierarchy of
equations relating the $n$-th order correlations (originating from the viscous
term in the NS eq.) to $n+1$'th order (originating from the nonlinear term) and
demonstrate that for fully unfused correlations the viscous term is negligible.
Consequently the hierarchic chain is decoupled in the sense that the
correlations of $n+1$'th order satisfy a homogeneous equation that may exhibit
anomalous scaling solutions. Using the same hierarchy of eqs. when some
separations go to zero we derive a second set of fusion rules for correlations
with differences in the viscous range. The latter includes gradient fields. We
demonstrate that every n'th order correlation function of velocity differences
${\cal F}_n(\B.R_1,\B.R_2,\dots)$ exhibits its own cross-over length $\eta_{n}$
to dissipative behavior as a function of, say, $R_1$. This length depends on
$n$ {and on the remaining separations} $R_2,R_3,\dots$. When all these
separations are of the same order $R$ this length scales like $\eta_n(R)\sim
\eta (R/L)^{x_n}$ with $x_n=(\zeta_n-\zeta_{n+1}+\zeta_3-\zeta_2)/(2-\zeta_2)$,
with $\zeta_n$ being the scaling exponent of the $n$'th order structure
function. We derive a class of exact scaling relations bridging the exponents
of correlations of gradient fields to the exponents $\zeta_n$ of the $n$'th
order structure functions. One of these relations is the well known ``bridge
relation"" for the scaling exponent of dissipation fluctuations $\mu=2-\zeta_6$.

  Revised version of a paper in the Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Very
  Large Corpora, MIT, 1995",,,,"cmp-lg cs.CL",,"  We describe, analyze, and evaluate experimentally a new probabilistic model
for word-sequence prediction in natural language based on prediction suffix
trees (PSTs). By using efficient data structures, we extend the notion of PST
to unbounded vocabularies. We also show how to use a Bayesian approach based on
recursive priors over all possible PSTs to efficiently maintain tree mixtures.
These mixtures have provably and practically better performance than almost any
single model. We evaluate the model on several corpora. The low perplexity
achieved by relatively small PST mixture models suggests that they may be an
advantageous alternative, both theoretically and practically, to the widely
used n-gram models.

that the ADM mass is extremized at fixed $A$, $J$, $(p,q)$ when the moduli
fields take the fixed value $\phi_{\rm fix}(p,q)$ which depend only on electric
and magnetic charges. It follows that the least mass of any black hole with
fixed conserved electric and magnetic charges is given by the mass of the
double-extreme black hole with these charges. Our work allows us to interpret
the previously established result that for all extreme black holes the moduli
fields at the horizon take a value $\phi= \phi_{\rm fix}(p,q)$ depending only
on the electric and magnetic conserved charges: $ \phi_{\rm fix}(p,q)$ is such
that the scalar charges $\Sigma ( \phi_{\rm fix}, (p,q))=0$.
