etale site of schemes over $S$. We introduce {\em presentable group sheaves}, a
full subcategory of the category of sheaves of groups on $\Xx /S$ which is
closed under kernel, quotient, and extension. Group sheaves which are
representable by group schemes of finite type over $S$ are presentable;
pullback and finite direct image preserve the notions of presentable group
sheaves; over $S=Spec (k)$ then presentable group sheaves are just group
schemes of finite type over $Spec(k)$; there is a notion of connectedness
extending the usual notion over $Spec(k)$; and a presentable group sheaf $G$
has a Lie algebra object $Lie(G $. If $G$ is a connected presentable group
sheaf then $G/Z(G)$ is determined up to isomorphism by the Lie algebra sheaf
$Lie (G)$.
  We envision the category of presentable group sheaves as a generalisation
relative to an arbitrary base scheme $S$, of the category of algebraic Lie
groups over $Spec (k)$.
  The notion of presentable group sheaf is used in order to define {\em
presentable $n$-stacks} over $\Xx$. Roughly, an $n$-stack is presentable if
there is a surjection from a scheme of finite type to its $\pi_0$ (the actual
condition on $\pi_0$ is slightly more subtle), and if its $\pi_i$ (which are
sheaves on various $\Xx /S$) are presentable group sheaves. The notion of
presentable $n$-stack is closed under homotopy fiber product and truncation.
  We propose the notion of presentable $n$-stack as an answer in characteristic
zero for A. Grothendieck's search for what he called ``schematization of
homotopy types''.

the host galaxy (proportional to L_opt^2). This dependence is also seen in the
bivariate luminosity function, which suggests that the evolutionary tracks of
radio sources and/or the initial conditions in the source are governed by the
host galaxy properties. The probability for detecting radio emission increases
with optical luminosity. The optical dependence is clearly separated in the
integral luminosity functions which can be used as a constraint to models of FR
I radio power evolution. Additionally, the source counts from the integrated
univariate radio luminosity function (RLF) are consistent with our suggestion
in paper V that radio sources may be a transient phenomenon which occurs in all
elliptical galaxies at some time (or several times) over their lifetime. We
find no statistically significant differences in the luminosity functions

The spectra are well modeled by thermal Comptonization and a dual neutral
absorber. We also find, for the first time for NGC 4151, a Compton-reflection
spectral component in the Ginga/OSSE data. The OSSE spectra of those and other
observations of NGC 4151 are statistically undistinguishable from the average
OSSE spectrum of radio-quiet Seyfert 1s. NGC 4151 observed in 1991 and 1993 has
the intrinsic X-ray/gamma-ray spectrum typical for Seyfert 1s, and the main
property distinguishing it from other Seyfert 1s is a large absorbing column of
$\sim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. We find no evidence for a strong, broad and
redshifted, Fe K$\alpha$ line component in the ASCA spectrum of 1993 May.
  On the other hand, we confirm previous studies in that archival X-ray data do
imply strong intrinsic X-ray variability and hardness of the intrinsic spectrum
in low X-ray states. An observed softening of the intrinsic X-ray spectrum with
the increasing flux implies variability in gamma-rays weaker than in X-rays,
which agrees with the 100 keV flux changing only within a factor of 2 in
archival OSSE and Granat/SIGMA observations.
  The relative hardness of the intrinsic X-ray spectrum rules out the
homogeneous hot corona/cold disk model for this source. Instead, the hot plasma
has to subtend a small solid angle as seen from the source of UV radiation. If
the hot plasma is purely thermal, it consists of electrons rather than $e^+e^-$
pairs. On the other hand, the plasma can be pair-dominated if a small fraction
of the power is nonthermal.

spectrum is well-fitted by a power-law X-ray continuum with an energy spectral
index of $\alpha \simeq 0.9$ moderately absorbed by an ionized medium and with
a Compton reflection component. A high-energy cutoff (or a break) in the the
power-law component at a few hundred keV or more is required by the data. We
also show that the corresponding average spectrum from HEAO A1 and A4 is fully
compatible with that obtained from EXOSAT, Ginga and OSSE. These results
confirm that the apparent discrepancy between the results of Ginga (with
$\alpha \simeq 0.9$) and the previous results of EXOSAT and HEAO (with $\alpha
\simeq 0.7$) is indeed due to ionized absorption and Compton reflection first
taken into account for Ginga but not for the previous missions. Also, our
results confirm that the Seyfert-1 spectra are on average cut off in gamma-rays
at energies of at least a few hundred keV, not at $\sim 40$ keV (as suggested
earlier by OSSE data alone). The average spectrum is compatible with emission
from either an optically-thin relativistic thermal plasma in a disk corona, or
with a nonthermal plasma with a power-law injection of relativistic electrons.

August 4-5. The ASCA SIS detectors allow a more detailed study of the iron K
complex than has been possible before. We find that prior to a sudden upward
flux transition the dominant iron K feature appears to consist of a large edge
from neutral or nearly-neutral iron. The depth of the edge corresponds to an
absorption column of about 1.5E24 cm^{-2}, while little absorption over that
expected from the Galaxy is seen at lower X-ray energies. The differential
absorption at high and low X-ray energies combined with the iron edge energy
are strong evidence that partial covering is a crucial determinant of the
behaviour observed from Cir X-1. The continuum spectral variability observed by
ASCA can also be understood naturally in terms of partial covering column
changes. There is evidence for a relatively weak emission line from neutral
iron with an equivalent width of only about 65 eV. After the flux transition,
the strength of the edge feature is greatly reduced, suggesting a large
reduction in the amount of partial covering. For a large region of
statistically acceptable chi-squared parameter space, the luminosity of Cir
X-1, after correction for partial covering, need not change during the
transition. We discuss models for the partial covering and suggest that X-ray
scattering by electrons may be important. Aspects of the Cir X-1 spectrum are
very similar to those of Seyfert 2 galaxies with Compton-thin tori.

The bound state--problem is analogous to that of point interactions in the

$ m $ discrete eigenvalues, $ 1\le m\le N $, the lowest of which is
nondegenerate. On the other hand, due to the presence of the boundary the point
interactions give rise to infinite series of resonances; if the coupling is
weak they approach the thresholds of higher transverse modes. We derive also
spectral and scattering properties for point perturbations in several related
models: a cylindrical surface, both of a finite and infinite heigth, threaded
by a magnetic flux, and a straight strip which supports a potential independent
of the transverse coordinate. As for strips with an infinite number of point
perturbations, we restrict ourselves to the situation when the latter are

disappearance of the energy gap for sufficiently large values of $\lambda$
indicates that the transition ultimately becomes of second order. In our
present investigation, based on a finite-size analysis, we show that already at
$\lambda= 0.9$ the critical exponent is characteristic of a second-order
transition. Interestingly, this exponent turns out to be definitely different
from that of the Gaussian case. We observe that the monopole density becomes
