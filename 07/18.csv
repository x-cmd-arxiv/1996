globular clusters are presented. Globular clusters with a variety of initial
masses, Galactocentric radii, concentration and initial mass function slope
with star formation efficiencies (SFEs) below 50% were investigated. The
residual gas in the clusters was simply treated as an external potential acting
upon the star particles which was reduced in a number of ways to simulate the
loss of the gas. The states of the clusters after ~50 Myr was compared to the
results of Chernoff & Shapiro (1987) in order to estimate if the clusters would
be able to survive for a Hubble time or would be disrupted. The rapid expulsion
of large amounts of a cluster's initial mass is found to considerably effect
the structures of clusters, but they may be able to survive with SFEs far lower
than 50%. It is suggested that the Galactic globular cluster population could
have formed from a proto-cluster populations with SFEs ~40% and central
densities approximately the same as those found in giant molecular clouds.

  Determination of $q_0$","in press ApJ(Letters)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure affects the determination
of the cosmological deceleration parameter $q_0$. We find that the lensing
induced dispersions on truly standard candles are $0.04$ and $0.02$ mag at
redshift $z=1$ and $z=0.5$, respectively, in a COBE-normalized cold dark matter
universe with $\Omega_0=0.40$, $\Lambda_0=0.6$, $H=65$km/s/Mpc and
$\sigma_8=0.79$. It is shown that one would observe $q_0=-0.44^{+0.17}_{-0.05}$
and $q_0=-0.45^{+0.10}_{-0.03}$ (the errorbars are $2\sigma$ limits) with
standard candles with zero intrinsic dispersion at redshift $z=1$ and $z=0.5$,
respectively, compared to the truth of $q_0=-0.40$ in this case, i.e., a 10\%
error in $q_0$ will be made. A standard COBE normalized $\Omega_0=1$ CDM model
would produce three times as much variance and a mixed (hot and cold) dark
matter model would lead to an intermediate result. One unique signature of this
dispersion effect is its non Gaussianity. Although the lensing induced
dispersion at lower redshift is still significantly smaller than the currently
best observed (total) dispersion of $0.12$ mag in a sample of type Ia
supernovae, selected with the multicolor light curve shape method, it becomes
significant at higher redshift. We show that there is an optimal redshift, in
the range $z\sim 0.5-2.0$ depending on the amplitude of the intrinsic
dispersion of the standard candles, at which $q_0$ can be most accurately
determined.

that the perturbations are not purely irrotational as they are in

an effective thickness of about 100 pc. A linearly, with distance, increasing
extinction up to a maximum value inside the absorbing layer is in first order a
good approximation for the actual extinction present along the line of sight.
We show that the morphology of the disc sequence gives a good indication of the
nearby extinction along the line of sight. The morphology of the bulge/bar red
horizontal branch is likely due to a combination of differential reddening and
a significant metallicity spread among the horizontal branch stars. This is
irrespective of the type of extinction law adopted. There is in Baade's Window
globally no big difference between a Poissonian or a patchy type of extinction,
except for substructures in the morphology of the sequences for the latter.

derived from the measured shear inside an annulus which is caused by the tidal
field of the deflecting mass distribution. Here we show that also the
multipoles of the two-dimensional mass distribution can be derived from the
shear in annuli. We derive several expressions for these mass multipole moments
in terms of the shear, which allow large flexibility in the choice of a radial
weight function. In contrast to determining multipole moments from weak-lensing
mass reconstructions, this approach allows to quantify the signal-to-noise
ratio of the multipole moments directly from the observed galaxy ellipticities,
and thus to estimate the significance of the multipole detection. Radial weight
functions can therefore be chosen such as to optimize the significance of the
detection given an assumed radial mass profile. Application of our formulae to
numerically simulated clusters demonstrates that the quadrupole moment of
realistic cluster models can be detected with high signal-to-noise ratio S/N;
in about 85 per cent of the simulated cluster fields S/N >~ 3. We also show
that the shear inside a circular annulus determines multipole moments inside
and outside the annulus. This is relevant for clusters whose central region is
too bright to allow the observation of the shear of background galaxies, or
which extend beyond the CCD. We also generalize the aperture mass equation to
the case of `radial' weight functions which are constant on arbitrarily-shaped
curves which are not necessarily self-similar.

pointed out. We demonstrate that the pure gauge theory has a non-Gaussian fixed
point with $\nu = 0.365(8)$ at the second order confinement-Coulomb phase
transition. Thus a non-asymptotic free and nontrivial continuum limit of this
theory, and of its various dual equivalents, in particular of a special case of
the effective string theory, can be constructed. Including a scalar matter
field (compact scalar QED), we confirm the Gaussian behavior at the endpoint of
the Higgs phase transition line. In the theory with both scalar and fermion
matter fields, we demonstrate the existence of a tricritical point. Here, the
chiral symmetry is broken, and the mass of unconfined composite fermions is
generated dynamically. Appart from the Goldstone bosons, the spectrum contains
also a massive scalar. This resembles the Higgs-Yukawa sector of the SM, albeit
of dynamical origin, like the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. However, the scaling
behavior is different from that in the NJL model and the nonperturbative
renormalizability might thus be possible.

coupling is a dynamically generated strong interaction effect, and is naturally
much larger than any other Yukawa coupling. The light quark doublets and
right-handed up-type quarks are also composite but at higher energies; the
hierarchy of quark masses and mixings is due to a hierarchy in the
compositeness scales. Flavor changing neutral currents are naturally
suppressed, as is baryon number violation by Planck-scale dimension five
operators. The model predicts that the most easily observable effects would be
on $b$-quark physics and on the $\rho$ parameter. In particular a small
negative $\Delta\rho=-\epsilon$ leads to $\Delta R_b> +2\epsilon$. There are
effects on $B$ meson mixing and on flavor-changing neutral-current $b$-quark
decays to leptons which might be detectable, but not on $b\rightarrow s\gamma$.

phenomenon occurs for effective strings produced by wrapping p-branes on a
small (p-1)-dimensional torus, for suitable coupling. To understand the decay
of an excited D-string at large dilaton values, we study the decay of an
elementary string at small dilaton values. A long string, multiply wound on a

another string with the same winding number and an unwound closed string
(rather than two wound strings). This decay amplitude agrees, under duality,
with the decay amplitude computed using the Born-Infeld action for the

that for the scalars obtained by reduction of the graviton, and both agree with
the cross section expected from a classical hole with the same charges.

show that the local invariance of the discrete action and the ensuing zero

edge lengths) to the induced metric components in the continuum. We discuss
mostly the two dimensional case, but argue that our results have general
validity. The previous analysis is then extended to the coupling with a scalar
field, and the invariance properties of the scalar field action under lattice
diffeomorphisms are exhibited. The construction of the lattice conformal gauge
is then described, as well as the separation of lattice metric perturbations
into orthogonal conformal and diffeomorphism part. The local gauge invariance
properties of the lattice action show that no Fadeev-Popov determinant is
required in the gravitational measure, unless lattice perturbation theory is
performed with a gauge-fixed action, such as the one arising in the lattice

number theory and report on recent results in support of this connection.

terms of anyons defined on a one-dimensional chain (or on a two-dimensional
lattice), the deformation parameter $q$ being related to the statistical
parameter $\nu$ of the anyons by $q = e^{i\pi\nu}$. In the limit of the
deformation parameter going to one we recover the Feingold-Frenkel fermionic
construction of undeformed affine Lie algebras.

arbitrary partitions through the repeated application of creation operators on
the constant 1. Three expressions for the creation operators are derived one
from the other. When the last of these expressions is used, the associated
Rodrigues formula readily implies the integrality of the (q,t)-Kostka
coefficients. The proofs given in this paper rely on the connection between
affine Hecke algebras and Macdonald polynomials

integrality of the (q,t)-Kostka coefficients, that is of the expansion
coefficients for the Macdonald functions in terms of Schur functions.

a quantum system is found by starting of a privileged skeletonization of the
functional action in phase space, provided by the complete solution of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This representation allows to regard the propagator
as the sum of the contributions coming from paths where the momenta generated
by the complete solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation are conserved -as it
does happen on the classical trajectory-, but are not restricted to having the
classical values associated with the boundary conditions for the original
coordinates.
