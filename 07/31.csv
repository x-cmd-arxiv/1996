$\sim 10^{51}$ erg which produce shells which expand at relativistic speeds
(Lorentz $\Gamma$ factors of $10^{2-3}$). We investigate the kinematic limits
on the source size due to the observed time structure in three types of bursts:
short spikes, FREDs (Fast Rise, Exponentail decay), and long complex bursts.
The emitting shell keeps up with the photons it produces reducing apparent
durations by $\Gamma^2$ so that source sizes can be very large ($2c\Gamma^2
T_{dur}). However, the thickness of the emitting region is not effected by the
shell motion so it must always be small, $c\Delta T$ where $\Delta T$ is the
subpeak time scale. We argue that one can only view the bulk motion head-on so
it is inappropriate to treat GRBs as viewing the sides of a jet. Although
photons come from a region within an angle $\Gamma^{-1}$, we show that the
curvature of the shell within that angle creates delays comparable to those
associated with the duration of the event. As a result, most bursts should be
like FREDs with sharp rises related to how long the shell emits and power law
decays related to how long the shell expanded before becoming gamma-ray active.
Few bursts have the long decay phases required for large shells resulting in
unacceptable high densities for ISM objects to cause the observed subpeaks. To
be consistent with the observations, perhaps very thick shells (which act as
parallel slabs) are required to avoid the effects of the curvature, or the
duration is dictated by a central engine.

accurate (to $\sim\pm0.1$ mag) measures of the mean brightness of the HB
--\vhb--, appropriate estimates of reddening for each cluster, and the adoption
of a distance modulus to M31 of \dmo = 24.43, this has allowed us to yield a
direct calibration for the mean absolute magnitude of the HB at the instability
strip --\mv-- with varying \fe: M_V^{HB} = (0.13 \pm 0.07)\fe + (0.95 \pm
0.09), where the associated errors result from the adopted global errors in the
measure and best fitting procedures. The slope of the derived relation is fully
consistent with that predicted by the standard and canonical models
($\sim0.15$) and obtained by various ground-based observations, while it is
only marginally compatible with higher values ($\sim0.30$), also obtained in
the past. The zero-point, which is crucial to absolute age determinations,
depends on the adopted distance to M31 and is moreover affected by an
additional error due to the residual uncertainties in the \hst photometric
zero-points ($\sim0.05$ mag, at least). If confirmed, such a calibration of the
\mv \vs \fe relationship would imply old absolute ages ($> 16$Gyr) for the
oldest Galactic globulars and fairly small age spread among those having a
constant magnitude difference between the Main-Sequence Turnoff and the HB.

  Astrophysical Journal Letters, accepted 1996 July 29",,"10.1086/310294",,"astro-ph",,"  Both electrons and ions are accelerated in solar flares and carry nonthermal
energy from the acceleration site to the chromospheric energy loss site, but
the relative amount of energy carried by electrons versus ions is subject of
debate. In this {\sl Letter} we test whether the observed energy-dependent
timing delays of 20-200 keV HXR emission can be explained in terms of
propagating electrons versus protons. For a typical flare, we show that the
timing delays of fast ($\lapprox 1$ s) {\sl HXR pulses} is consistent with
time-of-flight differences of directly precipitating electrons, while the
timing delays of the {\sl smooth HXR} flux is consistent with collisional
deflection times of trapped electrons. We show that these HXR timing delays
cannot be explained either by $\le 1$ MeV protons (as proposed in a model by
Simnett \& Haines 1990), because of their longer propagation and trapping
times, or by $\approx 40$ MeV protons (which have the same velocity as $\approx
20$ keV electrons), because of their longer trapping times and the excessive
fluxes required to generate the HXRs. Thus, the HXR timing results clearly rule
out protons as the primary generators of $\ge 20$ keV HXR emission.

deg)] and NGC 3680 [(l,b)= (286.8 deg, +16.9 deg)]. In addition to determining
the reddening toward these two clusters, it is shown that starcounts at
intermediate Galactic latitudes in the range 11< V< 17 allow us to constrain
the model scale-height for disk subgiants. We obtain a mean value of 250 +/- 32
pc, in agreement with previous determinations of the scale-height for
red-giants. We are also able to constrain the scale-height of main-sequence
stars, and the distance of the sun from the Galactic plane, ruling out the
possibility of a value of +40 pc, in favor of a smaller value. Comparisons with
the observed proper-motion histograms indicate that the velocity dispersion of
disk main-sequence stars must increase with distance from the Galactic plane in
order to match the observed proper-motion dispersion. The required increase is
consistent with the values predicted by dynamical models, and provides a clear
observational evidence in favor of such gradients. The shape of the observed
proper-motion distribution is well fitted within the Poisson uncertainties.
This implies that corrections to absolute proper motion (and, therefore, space
velocities) for open clusters may be obtained using our model when no inertial
reference frame is available. Using this approach, the derived tangential
motions for NGC 188 and NGC 3680 are presented.

theory is proposed. In particular, it is shown that the Dirac-like equation

specific class of reductions denoted as \cKPrm ($r,m \geq 1$) of the primary
continuum integrable system -- the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili ({\sf KP}) hierarchy
and discrete multi-matrix models. The relevant integrable \cKPrm structure is a
generalization of the familiar $r$-reduction of the full {\sf KP} hierarchy to
the $SL(r)$ generalized KdV hierarchy ${\sf cKP}_{r,0}$. The important feature
of \cKPrm hierarchies is the presence of a discrete symmetry structure
generated by successive Darboux-B\""{a}cklund (DB) transformations. This
symmetry allows for expressing the relevant tau-functions as Wronskians within
a formalism which realizes the tau-functions as DB orbits of simple initial
solutions. In particular, it is shown that any DB orbit of a ${\sf cKP}_{r,1}$
defines a generalized 2-dimensional Toda lattice structure. Furthermore, we
consider the class of truncated {\sf KP} hierarchies ({\sl i.e.}, those defined
via Wilson-Sato dressing operator with a finite truncated pseudo-differential
series) and establish explicitly their close relationship with DB orbits of
\cKPrm hierarchies. This construction is relevant for finding partition
functions of the discrete multi-matrix models.
  The next important step involves the reformulation of the familiar
non-isospectral additional symmetries of the full {\sf KP} hierarchy so that
their action on \cKPrm hierarchies becomes consistent with the constraints of
the reduction. Moreover, we show that the correct modified additional
symmetries are compatible with the discrete DB symmetry on the \cKPrm DB
orbits.

We analyze all such possible solutions in 5D Kaluza-Klein theory that are
static and spherically symmetric. We show that they can be obtained by taking
unusual choices of the parameters in the dyonic black hole solutions, and find
that regularity can only be achieved if their electric charge is zero. However,
they can be neutral or possess magnetic charge. We study some of their
properties, both in theories where the internal dimension is space-like as well
as time-like. Since bubbles do not have horizons, they have no entropy, nor do
they emit any thermal radiation, but they are, in general, non-extremal
objects. In the two-timing case, it is remarkable that non-singular massless
monopoles are possible, probably signaling a new pathology of these theories.
These two-timing monopoles connect two asymptotically flat regions, and matter
can flow from one region to the other. We also present a C-type solution that
describes neutral bubbles in uniform acceleration, and we use it to construct
an instanton that mediates the breaking of a cosmic string by forming bubbles
at its ends. The rate for this process is also calculated. Finally, we argue
that a similar solution can be constructed for magnetic bubbles, and that it
can be used to describe a semiclassical instability of the two-timing vacuum
against production of massless monopole pairs.

vector interactions. We conclude that one has to go beyond mean-field
approaches and take fluctuations and secondary production processes into
account to explain the recently measured enhancement of kaon production at
subthreshold energies. The situation is different for antikaons where in-medium
effects strongly enhances their production rates. We also see strong in-medium
modifications of the annihilation processes of antikaons and Lambda's which
might be visible in flow measurements. At high density, we predict that the
