the range $10^7$ - $2 \times 10^9$ g cm$^{-3}$ is calculated and its

improbable and appear unlikely on observational grounds. Simple deflagrations
require some means of boosting the flame speed beyond what currently exists in
the literature. ``Active turbulent combustion'' and multi-point ignition are
presented as two plausible ways of doing this. A deflagration that moves at the
``Sharp-Wheeler'' speed, $0.1 g_{\rm eff} t$, is calculated in one dimension
and shows that a healthy explosion is possible in a simple deflagration if the
front moves with the speed of the fastest floating bubbles. The relevance of
the transition to the ``distributed burning regime'' is discussed for delayed
detonations. No model emerges without difficulties, but detonation in the
distributed regime is plausible, will produce intermediate mass elements, and
warrants further study.

the odd part by means of a simple parameterization. We investigate the
photometric as well as the kinematic signatures of nuclear discs, including
their velocity profiles (VPs), and study the influence of seeing convolution.
The rotation curve of a nuclear disc gives an excellent measure of the central
mass-to-light ratio whenever the VPs clearly reveal the narrow, rapidly
rotating component associated with the nuclear disc. Steep cusps and seeing
convolution both result in central VPs that are dominated by the bulge light,
and these VPs barely show the presence of the nuclear disc, impeding
measurements of the central rotation velocities of the disc stars. However, if
a massive BH is present, the disc component of the VP can be seen in the wing
of the bulge part, and measurements of its mean rotation provide a clear
signature of the presence of the BH. This signature is insensitive to the
uncertainties in the velocity anisotropy, which often lead to ambiguity in the
interpretation of a central rise in velocity dispersion as due to a central BH.

properties of Green's functions can be obtained on the basis of weak coupling
perturbation expansions. Within this framework, the large momentum behavior of
the structure functions for gluon, quark and ghost propagators is derived. The
limits are found for general, covariant, linear gauges, and in all directions
of the complex $k^2-$plane. Except for the coefficients, the functional forms
of the leading asymptotic terms for the various structure functions are
independent of the gauge parameter. They are determined exactly in terms of
one-loop expressions (two-loop expressions in cases where one-loop terms
vanish). With the exception of the Landau gauge, the asymptotic expressions for
the gauge field propagator play an important r\^{o}le for the corresponding
limits of quark and ghost propagators. For {\it all} gauges considered, it is
the sign of the one-loop anomalous dimension coefficient of the gluon field in
Landau gauge (as a fixed point of the gauge parameter) which is of considerable
relevance for the asymptotics of the various propagators. The bounds obtained
from the asymptotic expressions, together with the analytic properties of the
structure functions, generally lead to un-subtracted dispersion
representations. In special cases, for a limited number of flavors, sum rules
are obtained for the discontinuities along the real axis. The sum rule for the
gluon propagator is a generalization of the superconvergence relation derived
previously in the Landau gauge.

"math/9607203","Alessandra Carbone","Alessandra Carbone and S. Semmes","Looking from the inside and from the outside",,,,"Logic E-prints July 05, 1996","math.LO",,"  One often sees a sharp distinction in mathematics between descriptions from
the outside and from the inside. Think of defining a set in the plane through
an algebraic equation, or dynamically as the closure of the orbit of some point
under iterations of a given mapping. In logic one sees this dichotomy in the
descriptions of sets of tautologies through semantics and proofs. Logic
provides several tools for making outer descriptions of mathematical objects.
  This paper concerns a slightly complicated mixture of themes related to inner
descriptions and formal proofs. We use the notion of feasibility to embed
mathematical structures into spaces of logical formulas, from which we can
obtain new structures through proofs. We present new geometries on finitely
generated groups through proofs, and new structure on the rational numbers (or
other fields) which is susceptible to dynamical processes, such as the action
of $SL(2,Z)$ by projective transformations. We consider the topological notion
of {\em Serre fibrations}. This entails more difficulties of formalization, but
basic points arise already for {\em torus bundles}, which present exponential
distortion through cycling in a nicely geometric way.
  One of our goals is to bring out mathematical structure related to cuts and
cut elimination. Our geometry on groups through proofs is far from the word
metric precisely because of the cut rule. We want to explore the idea that in
general the existence of short proofs with cuts should be related to internal
symmetry or dynamical processes in the underlying mathematical objects.
  We also want to bring ordinary mathematical proofs closer to proof theory. In
this regard the topological example is attractive for presenting realistic
difficulties.

does not collapse near the physical value of the nuclear force strength in the
particle-particle channel, as happens with the ordinary QRPA. Still, the
$\beta\beta_{2\nu}$ transition amplitude is only slightly less sensitive on
this parameter in the RQRPA than that in the plain QRPA. It is argued that this
fact reveals once more that the characteristic behaviour of the
$\beta\beta_{2\nu}$ transition amplitude within the QRPA is not an artifact of
the model, but a consequence of the partial restoration of the spin-isospin

a barrier represented by a power potential is considered in the case when the
barrier height is much greater than the oscillator ground state energy, and the
difference between the average energy of the packet and the nearest oscillator
eigenvalue is sufficiently small. The universal Poisson distribution of the
partial tunneling rates from the oscillator energy levels is discovered. The
explicit expressions for the tunneling rates of different types of packets
(coherent, squeezed, even/odd, thermal, etc.) are given in terms of the
exponential and modified Bessel functions. The tunneling rates turn out very
sensitive to the energy distributions in the packets, and they may exceed
significantly the tunneling rate from the energy state with the same average
number of quanta.

Opt","Quant.Semiclass.Opt. 8 (1996) 999","10.1088/1355-5111/8/5/006",,"quant-ph",,"  Short pulses of a probe laser have been used in the past to measure whether a
two-level atom is in its ground or excited state. The probe pulse couples the
ground state to a third, auxiliary, level of the atom. Occurrence or absence of
resonance fluorescence were taken to mean that the atom was found in its ground
or excited state, respectively. In this paper we investigate to what extent
this procedure results in an effective measurement to which the projection
postulate can be applied, at least approximately. We discuss in detail the
complications arising from an additional time development of the two-level
system proper during a probe pulse. We extend our previous results for weak
probe pulses to the general case and show that one can model an ideal
(projection-postulate) measurement much better with a strong than a weak probe
pulse. In an application to the quantum Zeno effect we calculate the slow-down
of the atomic time development under n repeated probe pulse measurements and
determine the corrections compared to the case of n ideal measurements.

with an arbitrarily chosen time of a bigger dynamical system. Fractional KdV
hierarchies are gotten by means of further reductions, obtained by constraining
the Laurent series. The case of sl(3)^2 and its bihamiltonian structure are
discussed in detail.
