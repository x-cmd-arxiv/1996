distribution of red giants shows that the stellar population comprises stars
with a wide range in metallicity. This distribution cannot be explained by a
spread in age. The blue side of the giant branch rises to M_I ~ -4.0 and can be
fitted with isochrones having [Fe/H] ~ -1.5. The red side consists of a heavily
populated and dominant sequence that tops out at M_I ~ -3.2, and extends beyond
V-I=4. This sequence can be fitted with isochrones with -0.2 < [Fe/H] < +0.1,
for ages running from 15 Gyr to 5 Gyr respectively. We do not find the
optically bright asymptotic giant branch stars seen in previous ground-based
work and argue that the majority of them were artifacts of crowding. Our
results are consistent with the presence of the infrared-luminous giants found
in ground-based studies, though their existence cannot be directly confirmed by
our data. There is little evidence for an extended or even a red horizontal
branch, but we find a strong clump on the giant branch itself. If the age
spread is not extreme, the distribution of metallicities in M32 is considerably
narrower than that of the closed-box model of chemical evolution, and also
appears somewhat narrower than that of the solar neighborhood. Overall, the M32
HST color-magnitude diagram is consistent with the average luminosity-weighted
age of 8.5 Gyr and [Fe/H] = -0.25 inferred from integrated spectral indices.

for the projection of phase space which is directly measured by redshift

projected overdensity has a strong dependence on the cosmological density
parameter Omega. The redshift dispersion statistic is easy to compute and can
be motivated by applying the Cosmic Virial Theorem to subsets of galaxies with
the same local density. We show that the velocity dispersion of particles in
these subsets is proportional to the product of Omega and the local density.
Low resolution N-body simulations of several cosmological models (open/closed
CDM, CDM+Lambda, HDM) indicate that the proportionality between velocity
dispersion, local density and Omega holds over redshift scales in the range 50
km/s to 500 km/s. The redshift dispersion may provide an interesting means for
comparing volume-limited subsamples of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to
equivalent N-body/hydrodynamics simulations.

This comparison is conveniently made in terms of a temperature dependent

a role which is analogous to the scattering length for pseudopotentials, but it
is temperature dependent and may include more physical effects than just binary

the BCS pairing transition. As an illustration, numerical results for quantum

possible. As an application, we derive the counting statistics in a single
channel conductor at finite temperature and bias. For a perfectly transmitting
channel the counting distribution is gaussian, both for zero-point fluctuations

distribution is binomial, i.e., it arises from Bernoulli statistics. Another
application considered is the noise due to short current pulses that involve

unitarity and the low-energy theorems in contrast with other more conventional

it yields a consistent description of the Higgs boson mass and width. Finally
we have also included a phenomenological discussion concerning the applications

  September 1995; hard copy of 3 figures available from the authors",,,"GUTPA-96-7-1","hep-ph",,"  We argue that some of the parameters in the laws of Nature would be well
understood, under the assumption that there is an influence from the future as
well as from the past, in the sense that the principle of locality is not valid
at the fundamental level. However, locality is supposed to be broken only in
the mild way that all the non-local influence comes from integrals over the
whole of space-time and acts at all moments and all places with the same
effect. Thus the observable effects of the lack of locality can only be seen in
the constants of Nature. Our cleanest prediction is the Higgs boson mass being
149 +/- 26 GeV, which in addition assumes that the pure Standard Model is valid
until the Planck scale. Adding the assumption that the two vacuum states needed
in our model come about naturally requires a strong first order transition
between them; together with the assumption of the Planck units being
fundamental, this leads us to also predict the top quark mass as 173 +/- 5 GeV,
and a more precise value of the Higgs boson mass as 135 +/- 9 GeV. With the
assumption of the anti-grand unified group SMG x SMG x SMG (three copies of the
Standard Model gauge group, one for each generation), it is also possible to
successfully predict the three fine structure constants in the Standard Model.
We also discuss the extension of the SMG x SMG x SMG group by an extra abelian
factor U(1)_f and the fermion mass matrices in this model. Other vacua than the
present one might appear in the future due to human activity. The breaking of
locality is really of the same mild character as suggested by baby universe
theory, so the present work may be considered as a development of baby universe
theory.
