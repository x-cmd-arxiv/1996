in 0.5--2.0 keV flux by a factor of about 9 on a time-scale of 11 months or
less. It is seen by ASCA about one month after the second PSPC pointing, and is
seen to have dimmed by a factor of > 7 in a ROSAT HRI pointing about one year
after the second PSPC pointing. Its maximum observed 0.8--2.5 keV luminosity is
about 8E38 erg/s, making it brighter than any known persistent X-ray binary in
the Milky Way. Its total X-ray luminosity is probably larger than 1.2E39 erg/s.
The observed variability argues against a superbubble interpretation, and the
off-nuclear position argues against a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus.
The source is therefore probably either an ultra-powerful X-ray binary or an
ultra-powerful supernova remnant. Optical monitoring has not identified any
supernovae in NGC 4945 during the time of the X-ray observations, and any

was expressed as a function of hydrogen chemical potential. As the chemical
potential increased, the stable phase successively changed from bare 2x1 to

$T(t)=T_i-\gamma t$, where $\gamma$ is the cooling rate. We find that the glass
transition temperature $T_g$ is in accordance with a logarithmic dependence on
the cooling rate. In qualitative accordance with experiments, the density shows
a local maximum, which becomes more pronounced with decreasing cooling rate.
The enthalpy, density and the thermal expansion coefficient for the glass at
zero temperature decrease with decreasing $\gamma$. We show that also
microscopic quantities, such as the radial distribution function, the bond-bond
angle distribution function, the coordination numbers and the distribution
function for the size of the rings depend significantly on $\gamma$. We
demonstrate that the cooling rate dependence of these microscopic quantities is
significantly more pronounced than the one of macroscopic properties.

simulation, are in good agreement with the ones measured in real experiments,
thus demonstrating that the used potential is a good model for silica glass.

of quarks is combined with a Fermi sea of nucleons. In both cases, working in
mean-field approximation, we find a chiral phase transition from Goldstone to
Wigner phase. At finite density the chiral order parameter and the constituent
quark mass have a non-monotonic temperature dependence - at finite temperatures
not close to the critical one they are less affected than in the cold matter.
Whereas the quark matter is rather soft against thermal fluctuations and the
corresponding chiral phase transition is smooth, the nucleon matter is much
stiffer and the chiral phase transition is very sharp. The thermodynamical
variables show large discontinuities which is an indication for a first order
phase transition. We solve the B=1 solitonic sector of the NJL model in the
presence of an external hot quark and nucleon medium. In the hot medium at
intermediate temperature the soliton is more bound and less swelled than in the
case of a cold matter. At some critical temperature, which for the nucleon
matter coincides with the critical temperature for the chiral phase transition,
we find no more a localized solution. According to this model scenario one
should expect a sharp phase transition from the nucleon to the quark matter.

photons, the existence of a surface term giving a negative contribution to the

is argued that similar terms could appear dealing with any integer spin $s\geq

point of view of algebraic quantum field theory. At level $1$ it turns out that
the observable algebras of the WZW theory can be constructed in terms of even
CAR algebras. This fact allows to give a formulation of these models close to
the DHR framework. Localized endomorphisms are constructed explicitly in terms
of Bogoliubov transformations, and the WZW fusion rules are proven using the
DHR sector product.
  At level $2$ it is shown that most of the sectors are realized in
$\HNSh=\HNS\otimes\HNS$ where $\HNS$ is the Neveu-Schwarz sector of the level
$1$ theory. The level $2$ characters are derived and $\HNSh$ is decomposed
completely into tensor products of the sectors of the WZW chiral algebra and
irreducible representation spaces of the coset Virasoro algebra. Crucial for
this analysis is the DHR decomposition of $\HNSh$ into sectors of a gauge
invariant fermion algebra since the WZW chiral algebra as well as the coset
Virasoro algebra are invariant under the gauge group $\Oz$.

"math/9607214",,"Roy Adler","Symbolic Dynamics and Markov Partitions",,,,"MSRI 1996-053","math.DS",,"  The decimal expansion real numbers, familiar to us all, has a dramatic
generalization to representation of dynamical system orbits by symbolic
sequences. The natural way to associate a symbolic sequence with an orbit is to
track its history through a partition. But in order to get a useful symbolism,
one needs to construct a partition with special properties. In this work we
develop a general theory of representing dynamical systems by symbolic systems
by means of so-called Markov partitions. We apply the results to one of the
more tractable examples: namely hyperbolic automorphisms of the two dimensional
torus. While there are some results in higher dimensions, this area remains a
fertile one for research.

proposed in which the magnitude of the net charge q_i on each atom in an
ordered or random alloy depends linearly on the number N_i^(1) of unlike
neighbors in its first coordination shell. Point charges extracted from recent
large supercell (256-432 atom) local density approximation (LDA) calculations
of Cu-Zn random alloys now enable an assessment of the physical validity and
accuracy of the simple model. We find that this model accurately describes (i)
the trends in q_i vs. N_i^(1), particularly for fcc alloys, (ii) the magnitudes
of total electrostatic energies in random alloys, (iii) the relationships
between constant-occupation-averaged charges <q_i> and Coulomb shifts <V_i>
(i.e., the average over all sites occupied by either $A$ or $B$ atoms) in the
random alloy, and (iv) the linear relation between the site charge q_i and the
constant- charge-averaged Coulomb shift (i.e., the average over all sites with
the same charge) for fcc alloys. However, for bcc alloys the fluctuations
predicted by the model in the q_i vs. V_i relation exceed those found in the
LDA supercell calculations. We find that (a) the fluctuations present in the
model have a vanishing contribution to the electrostatic energy. (b)
Generalizing the model to include a dependence of the charge on the atoms in
the first three (two) shells in bcc (fcc) - rather than the first shell only -
removes the fluctuations, in complete agreement with the LDA data. We also
demonstrate an efficient way to extract charge transfer parameters of the
generalized model from LDA calculations on small unit cells.
