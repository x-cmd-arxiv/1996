either 330 central relaxation times ($\trc$) or 12--19 half-mass relaxation
times ($\trh$). But the first of these times applies only to the late stages of
core collapse, and the second only to low-concentration clusters. To clarify
how the time depends on the mass distribution, the Fokker-Planck equation is
solved for the evolution of a variety of isotropic cluster models, including
King models, models with power-law density cusps of $\rho\sim r^{-\gamma}$, and
models with nuclei. High-concentration King models collapse faster than
low-concentration models if the time is measured in units of $\trh$, but slower
if it is measured in units of $\trc$. Models with cusps evolve faster than King
models, but not all of them collapse: those with $0<\gamma<2$ expand because
they start with a temperature inversion. Models with nuclei collapse or expand
as the nuclei would in isolation if their central relaxation times are short;
otherwise their evolution is more complicated. Suggestions are made for how the
results can be applied to globular clusters, galaxies, and hypothetical
clusters of dark stars in the centers of galaxies.

the recombination of excitonic states can account for recent observations of

extrapolation of the NRQCD results and the static case, as expected. We find
the slope of the decay constants with $1/M$ is significantly larger than naive
expectations and the results of previous lattice calculations. For the first
time we extract the non-perturbative coefficients of the slope arising from the
$O(1/M)$ heavy quark interactions separately and show the kinetic energy of the
heavy quark is dominant and responsible for the large slope. In addition, we
find that significant systematic errors remain in the decay constant extracted
around the $B$ meson mass due to truncating the NRQCD series at $O(1/M)$. We
estimate the higher order contributions to $f_B$ are approximately $20\%$;
roughly the same size as the systematic errors introduced by using the Wilson
action for light quarks.

basic problems: $i$) the existence of reducible field configurations on which
the action of the gauge group is not free and $ii$) the Gribov ambiguity
associated with gauge fixing, i. e. the lack of global definition on the space
of gauge orbits of gauge fixed functional integrals. In this paper, we show
that such problems are in fact related and we propose a general completely
geometrical recipe for their treatment. The space of field configurations is
augmented in such a way to render the action of the gauge group free and
localization is suitably modified. In this way, the standard Mathai--Quillen
formalism can be rigorously applied. The resulting topological action contains
the ordinary action as a subsector and can be shown to yield a local quantum
field theory, which is argued to be renormalizable as well. The salient feature
of our method is that the Gribov problem is inherent in localization, and thus
can be dealt with in a completely equivariant setting, whereas gauge fixing is
free of Gribov ambiguities. For the stratum of irreducible gauge orbits, the
case of main interest in applications, the Gribov problem is solvable.
Conversely, for the the strata of reducible gauge orbits, the Gribov problem
cannot be solved in general and the obstruction may be described in the
language of sheaf theory. The formalism is applied to the Donaldson--Witten
model.

for $Sp(4)$ reduced to its $SU(2) \times U(1)$ subgroup, and the relevant
generator matrix elements are evaluated for generic representations $(a,b)$ of
$Sp(4)$. (The degenerate representations $(a,0)$ and $(0,b)$ were treated in
our previous work and are also given in this paper). The group--subgroup in
question is that of the seniority model of nuclear physics.

spaces. These are noncommutative spaces that inherit a well defined
mathematical structure from the quantum group symmetry. In turn such quantum
spaces can be interpreted as noncommutative configuration spaces for physical
systems which carry a symmetry like structure. These configuration spaces will
be generalized to noncommutative phase space. The definition of the
noncommutative phase space will be based on a differential calculus on the
configuration space which is compatible with the symmetry. In addition a
conjugation operation will be defined which will allow us to define the phase
space variables in terms of algebraically selfadjoint operators. An interesting
property of the phase space observables will be that they will have a discrete
spectrum. These noncommutative phase space puts physics on a lattice structure.

  1996","q-alg math.CA math.QA",,"  The Koornwinder-Macdonald multivariable generalization of the Askey-Wilson
polynomials is studied for parameters satisfying a truncation condition such
that the orthogonality measure becomes discrete with support on a finite grid.
For this parameter regime the polynomials may be seen as a multivariable
counterpart of the (one-variable) $q$-Racah polynomials. We present the
discrete orthogonality measure, expressions for the normalization constants
converting the polynomials into an orthonormal system (in terms of the
normalization constant for the unit polynomial), and we discuss the limit $q\to
1$ leading to multivariable Racah type polynomials. Of special interest is the
situation that $q$ lies on the unit circle; in that case it is found that there
exists a natural parameter domain for which the discrete orthogonality measure
(which is complex in general) becomes real-valued and positive. We investigate
the properties of a finite-dimensional discrete integral transform for
functions over the grid, whose kernel is determined by the multivariable
$q$-Racah polynomials with parameters in this positivity domain.
