  Exponents","4 pages, REVTeX, Phys. Rev. Letters, submitted",,,,"chao-dyn nlin.CD",,"  On the basis of the Navier-Stokes equations we develop the statistical theory
of many space-time correlation functions of velocity differences. Their time
dependence is {\em not} scale invariant: $n$-order correlations functions
exhibit $n-1$ distinct decorrelation times that are characterized by $n-1$
anomalous dynamical scaling exponents. We derive exact scaling relations that
bridge all these dynamical exponents to the static anomalous exponents
$\zeta_n$ of the standard structure functions.

  Approximation","10 pages, LaTeX type, submitted to PRE",,,,"chao-dyn nlin.CD",,"  A dynamic equation for velocity structure functions $S_{n}(r) =
<(u(x)-u(x'))^{n}>$ in strong turbulence is derived in the one-loop (eddy
viscosity) approximation. This homogemeous differential equation yields scaling
exponents $\xi_{n}$ in the relations $S_{n}(r)\propto r^{\xi_{n}}$ which are in
a very good agreement with experimental data.

interfaces. We present an overview of current experimental picture and discuss
available theoretical approaches and their limitations. We report some new
experimental results on spreading of molecularly thin liquid films and propose
an analytically solvable microscopic model, which reproduces experimentally
observed behaviors and provides a seemingly plausible explanation of the
underlying physical processes.

bundles, defined as C^*-algebra bundles over topological groupoids. Such
bundles are a mutual generalization of semi-direct products of groups with
C^*-algebras and C^*-algebra bundles over topological spaces. In particular a
Morita equivalence theorem with semi-direct products is established.

reducing the original 4-dimensional integral equation into an infinite set of
coupled 1-dimensional ones. It is shown that this representation offers a
highly accurate method to determine numerically the bound state solutions. For
generic cases only a few hyperspherical waves are needed to achieve
convergence, both for the ground state as well as for radially or orbitally
excited states. The wave function is reconstructed for several cases and in
particular it is shown that it becomes independent of the relative time in the
nonrelativistic regime.
