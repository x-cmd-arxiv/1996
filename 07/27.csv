pressure, and travel through space to other star systems. Under many
conditions, this kind of panspermia is impractical, primarily because the
ultraviolet (UV) radiation of the present Sun inactivates the micro-organisms.
However, if the organisms are shielded by an absorbing material like carbon,
and if ejection takes place in the late-Sun (red-giant) phase of a
one-solar-mass star like our Sun, there is a significant probability that these
micro-organisms can reach another star system alive (i.e., with only sub-lethal
damage from UV and ionizing radiation). In addition to panspermia with viable
micro-organisms, we note that it is possible to seed the Galaxy with
inactivated ones, whose DNA and RNA fragments may provide the initial
information necessary to start biological evolution in favorable environments.

provides the framework for understanding the time evolution of isolated
nanoscale features (i.e., islands and pits) on surfaces. Two limiting cases are
predicted, in which either diffusion or interface transfer is the limiting
process. These cases correspond to similar regimes considered in previous works
addressing the Ostwald ripening of ensembles of features. A third possible
limiting case is noted for the special geometry of ""stacked"" islands. In these
limiting cases, isolated features are predicted to decay in size with a power
law scaling in time: A is proportional to (t0-t)^n, where A is the area of the
feature, t0 is the time at which the feature disappears, and n=2/3 or 1. The
constant of proportionality is related to parameters describing both the
kinetic and equilibrium properties of the surface. A continuous time Monte
Carlo simulation is used to test the application of this theory to generic
surfaces with atomic scale features. A new method is described to obtain
macroscopic kinetic parameters describing interfaces in such simulations.
Simulation and analytic theory are compared directly, using measurements of the
simulation to determine the constants of the analytic theory. Agreement between
the two is very good over a range of surface parameters, suggesting that the
analytic theory properly captures the necessary physics. It is anticipated that
the simulation will be useful in modeling complex surface geometries often seen
in experiments on physical surfaces, for which application of the analytic
model is not straightforward.

product expansion is used to describe semileptonic decays of heavy flavors. In
the first part of the dissertation we calculate differential distributions in

the double distribution in electron energy and invariant mass of the lepton
pair is calculated. The distributions are calculated as series in $m_Q^{-1}$
where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark mass. All effects up to $m_Q^{-2}$ are included.
  Also calculated are the energy distribution and semileptonic decay width for
the case of a heavy lepton in the final state.
  Based on the results of the first part of the work, we calculate the full up
to order $1/m_Q^2$ set of the OPE sum rules for the heavy flavor transitions
and radiative corrections to them up to order $\alpha_s\Lambda_{QCD}/m_Q$.

semileptonic decays of the $B$ mesons $B\rightarrow l\bar{\nu}X_c$, which is
{\em defined} by the requirement that it should satisfy the QCD consistency
conditions. These conditions are imposed in the form of the OPE sum rules. It
is shown that under some natural assumptions the OPE sum rules provide
sufficient number of constraints to fully determine exclusive contributions of
a number of resonances in the final state of the decay. The theoretical results
for the model are presented in the form suitable for comparison with
experimental data. The proposed model can be used for experimental measurements
of the heavy meson matrix element $\mu _\pi ^2$ which describes the kinetic
energy of the heavy quark inside the hadron, as well as for extraction of the
value of $|V_{cb}|$ from experimental data and other applications.
