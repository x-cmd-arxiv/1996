where they, among other things, produce a natural isomorphism between the sheaf
of (n-1)-th order jets of the n-th tensor power of the tangent bundle of a
Riemann surface equipped with a projective structure and the sheaf of
differential operators of order n (on the trivial bundle) with vanishing 0-th
order part. We give a different proof of this result without using the
coordinates, and following the idea of this proof we prove:
  Take a line bundle L with $L^2 = T$ on a Riemann surface equipped with a
projective structure. Then the jet bundle $J^n(L^n)$ has a natural flat
connection with $J^n(L^n) = S^n(J^1(L))$. For any $m >n$ the obvious surjection
$J^m(L^n) \rightarrow J^n(L^n)$ has a canonical splitting. In particular,
taking $m = n+1$, one gets a natural differential operator of order $n+1$ from
$L^n$ to $L^{-n-2}$.

height-integrated flow. The solutions satisfy consistent boundary conditions at
both ends. We obtain well-behaved transonic solutions for a wide range of
values of the viscosity parameter $\alpha$, from 0.001 to 0.3. We do not find
any need for shocks in our solutions, and disagree with previous claims that
viscous accretion flows with low values of $\alpha$ must have shocks. We see a
qualitative difference between solutions with low values of the viscosity
parameter, $\alpha\ \sles\ 0.01$, and those with large values, $\alpha\sgreat\
0.01$. The solutions with low $\alpha$ have their sonic transitions occurring
close to the radius of the marginally bound orbit. These flows are
characterized by regions of super-Keplerian rotation, and have pressure maxima
outside the sonic point. The solutions are similar in many respects to the
hydrostatic thick tori developed previously as models of active galactic
nuclei. In contrast, the solutions with large $\alpha$ have sonic transitions
farther out, close to or beyond the marginally stable orbit, and have no
super-Keplerian rotation or pressure maxima. We believe these flows will be
nearly quasi-spherical down to the sonic radius and will not have empty funnels
along the rotation axis. The large $\alpha$ solutions are more likely to be
representative of real systems.

by bulk motions of CIV-containing gas clouds inside LMC4. These hot clouds or

parameters enter the density law only through their combination c. At the

different spectral types of galaxies, we show our model galaxy broad band

small double are found to be associated with cluster galaxies. At X-ray

ongoing cluster merger, with the axis in the east-west to southeast-northwest

Differences between arm and interarm regions are specifically studied by
decomposing the images into arm and non-arm zones. We find from a comparison of
the morphology in H$\alpha$, HI and dust that while the first two are
coincident over most of the disc, they are offset from the dust lanes
especially along the inner parts of the spiral arms: a picture which is
indicative of a density wave shock moving through the arms. HI is formed near
the young massive stars as a result of photo-dissociation. From radial profiles
we find that in the region of the star-forming spiral arms the exponential
scale lengths for H$\alpha$, blue and near-infrared light, and 21 cm radio
continuum are equal within the fitting errors. The scale lengths for the
interarm region are also equal for all these tracers, but the arm scale lengths
are significantly longer. This points to a common origin of the profiles in
star formation, with little or no influence from radial population gradients or
dust in the disc of this galaxy. The longer arm scale lengths are equivalent to
an outwardly increasing arm-interarm contrast. We argue that the radial
profiles of radio continuum and HI, as well as CO, are also directly regulated
by star formation, and discuss the possible implications of this result for the
interpretation of observed CO intensities in and outside spiral arms. We
discuss the radial atomic hydrogen profile in some detail. Its almost perfectly

simultaneously maximizes the energy gap for {\it all} proteins in the database.
To test our method and compare it with other knowledge-based approaches to

model we build a database of model proteins by a) picking randomly 200 lattice
chain conformations; b) designing sequences which fold into these structures
with some arbitrary ``true'' potential; c) use this database for extracting a
potential; d) fold model proteins using the extracted potential. This test on

with correlation $r \approx 91\%$ with the ``true'' one and we were able to
fold all model structures using the recovered potential. Other statistical
knowledge-based approaches were tested using lattice models and the results
indicate that they also can recover the ``true'' potential with high degree of

contact pairwise approximation, our potential scored somewhat better than
existing ones. However, the discrimination of the native structure from decoys
is still not strong enough to make the potential useful for {\em ab initio}
folding. We argue that more detail of protein structure and energetics should
be taken into account to achieve better energy gaps. The suggested method is
general to allow to systematically derive parameters for more sophisticated
energy function. The internal control of validity of the potential derived by
our method, is converegency to a unique solution upon addition of new proteins
to the database.

fluctuations, rendering the critical behaviour of these systems classical for a
one--dimensional soft sector, and classical with logarithmic corrections in
case of a two--dimensional soft sector. The dynamical critical exponent is $z =
2$, and as a consequence the sound velocity vanishes as $c_s \propto | T - T_c

temperature--independent. Disorder may lead to a variety of precursor effects
and modified critical behaviour. Defects that locally soften the crystal may
induce the phenomenon of local order parameter condensation. When the

behaviour in gravitational collapse. We adopt the method of renormalization
group, which has the following advantages. (1) It provides a natural
explanation for various types of universality and scaling observed in numerical
studies. In particular, universality in initial data space and universality for
different models are understood in a unified way. (2) It enables us to perform
a detailed analysis of time evolution beyond linear perturbation, by providing
rigorous controls on nonlinear terms. Under physically reasonable assumptions
we prove: (1) Uniqueness of the relevant mode around a fixed point implies
universality in initial data space. (2) The critical exponent $\beta_{BH}$ and
the unique positive eigenvalue $\kappa$ of the relevant mode is exactly related
by $\beta_{BH} = \beta /\kappa$, where $\beta$ is a scaling exponent. (3) The
above (1) and (2) hold also for discretely self-similar case (replacing ``fixed
point'' with ``limit cycle''). (4) Universality for diffent models holds under
a certain condition.
  According to the framework, we carry out a rather complete (though not
mathematically rigorous) analysis for perfect fluids with pressure proportional
to density, in a wide range of the adiabatic index $\gamma$. The uniqueness of
the relevant mode around a fixed point is established by Lyapunov analyses.
This shows that the critical phenomena occurs not only for the radiation fluid
but also for perfect fluids with $1 < \gamma \lesssim 1.88$. The accurate
values of critical exponents are calculated for the models.

multiplicity to participant nucleon as well as to pion multiplicity are larger
for central nucleus--nucleus collisions than for nucleon--nucleon interactions
at all studied energies. The data at AGS energies suggest that the latter ratio
saturates with increasing masses of the colliding nuclei. The strangeness to
pion multiplicity ratio observed in nucleon--nucleon interactions increases
with collision energy in the whole energy range studied. A qualitatively
different behaviour is observed for central nucleus--nucleus collisions: the
ratio rapidly increases when going from Dubna to AGS energies and changes
little between AGS and SPS energies. This change in the behaviour can be
related to the increase in the entropy production observed in central
nucleus-nucleus collisions at the same energy range. The results are
interpreted within a statistical approach. They are consistent with the
hypothesis that the Quark Gluon Plasma is created at SPS energies, the critical
collision energy being between AGS and SPS energies.

$\Lambda$ hypernuclei through the one- and two-nucleon induced mechanisms. The
momentum distributions of the primary nucleons are calculated and a Monte Carlo
simulation is used to account for final state interactions. From the spectra we
calculate the number of neutrons ($N_n$) and protons ($N_p$) per $\Lambda$
decay and show how the measurement of these quantities, particularly $N_p$, can
lead to a determination of $\Gamma_n / \Gamma_p$, the ratio of neutron to
proton induced $\Lambda$ decay. We also show that the consideration of the
two-nucleon induced channel has a repercussion in the results, widening the
band of allowed values of $\Gamma_n / \Gamma_p$ with respect to what is
obtained neglecting this channel.

QRPA near the physical value of the force strength can be circumvented. This is
done by including the effect of ground state correlations into the QRPA
equations of motion. The corresponding formalism, called renormalized QRPA, is
briefly outlined and its consequences are discussed in the framework of a
schematic model for the two-neutrino double beta decay in the $^{100}Mo
\rightarrow\, ^{100}Ru$ system. The question of the conservation of the Ikeda
sum rule is also addressed within the new formalism.

models for physical spacetime or as models for testing the spirit of
non-commutative geometry. In this work, we construct the differential algebras
for graphs by extending the work of Dimakis et al and discuss linear
connections and curvatures on graphs. Especially, we calculate connections and
curvatures explicitly for the general nonzero torsion case. There is a metric,
but no metric-compatible connection in general except the complete symmetric
graph with two vertices.

identity. They proved to be useful for the $k$-constrained hierarchies
providing a series of determinant identities for them. A differential equation
is introduced which is called ``universal"" since it plays an important role for
all the $k$-constrained hierarchies. In the cases $k=1,2$ and 3 explicit
formulas are presented, in all the others recurrence relations are given which
enable one to obtain the identities.
