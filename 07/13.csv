integrable systems (complete commutative rings of differential operators), and
differential Galois theory. We define quantum completely integrable systems
(QCIS), algebraically integrable QCIS, the differential Galois group of a QCIS.
We show that the differential Galois group is always reductive and that a QCIS
is algebraically integrable if and only if its differential Galois group is
commutative. In particular, we show that a differential operator L in one
variable is algebraic in the sense of Krichever (i.e. finite-zone) if and only
if the differential Galois group of the differential equation Lf=af is
commutative for a generic number a. As a by-product, we obtain a proof of the
Veselov-Chalyh conjecture on the algebraic integrability of the elliptic
Calogero-Moser system.

by static frictional forces; these are subject to microscopic indeterminacy
which corresponds macroscopically to the fact that the equations of stress
continuity are incomplete -- no strain variable can be defined. We propose that
in general the continuity equations should be closed by means of a constitutive
relation (or relations) between different components of the (mesoscopically
averaged) stress tensor. The primary constitutive relation relates radial and
vertical shear and normal stresses (in two dimensions, this is all one needs).
We argue that the constitutive relation(s) should be local, and should encode
the construction history of the pile: this history determines the organization
of the grains at a mesoscopic scale, and thereby the local relationship between
stresses. To the accuracy of published experiments, the pattern of stresses
beneath a pile shows a scaling between piles of different heights (RSF scaling)
which severely limits the form the constitutive relation can take ...

perspective of chiral symmetry. It is argued that chiral perturbation theory
cannot yield a prediction for the strangeness radius and magnetic moment.
Arrival at definite predictions requires the introduction of additional,
model-dependent assumptions which go beyond the framework of chiral
perturbation theory. A variety of such model predictions is surveyed, and the
credibility of each is evaluated. The most plausible prediction appears in a
model where the unknown chiral counterterms are identified with $t$-channel
vector meson exchange amplitudes. The corresponding prediction for the mean
square Dirac strangeness radius is $\langle r_s^2\rangle = 0.24$ fm$^2$, which
would be observable in up-coming semileptonic determinations of the nucleon's
strangeness form factors.
