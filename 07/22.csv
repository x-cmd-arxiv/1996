significantly the degree of the cosmological redshift distortion, one can
determine the density parameter $\Omega_0$ from the distortion pattern at

In particular we show that in low-density ($\Omega_0\ll 1$) universes one can
determine the value of $\lambda_0$ and even the evolution of the bias parameter
almost insensitively to the degree of the clumpiness of the matter distribution

excited states of an integrable model, starting from the Thermodynamic Bethe
Ansatz equations for its ground state. The idea relies on analytic continuation
through complex values of the coupling constant, and an analysis of the
monodromies that the equations and their solutions undergo. For the scaling
Lee-Yang model, we find equations in this way for the one- and two- particle
states in the spin-zero sector, and suggest various generalisations. Numerical
results show excellent agreement with the truncated conformal space approach,
and we also treat some of the ultraviolet and infrared asymptotics
analytically.

finitized characters in conformal field theory, one can extract mathematical
objects known as Bailey pairs. Recently Berkovich, McCoy and Schilling have
constructed a `generalized' character formula depending on two parameters $\ra$
and $\r2$, using the Bailey pairs of the unitary model $M(p-1,p)$. By taking
appropriate limits of these parameters, they were able to obtain the characters
of model $M(p,p+1)$, $N=1$ model $SM(p,p+2)$, and the unitary $N=2$ model with
central charge $c=3(1-{\frac{2}{p}})$. In this letter we computed the effective
central charge associated with this `generalized' character formula using a
saddle point method. The result is a simple expression in dilogarithms which
interpolates between the central charges of these unitary models.

considered at the symmetric point on the moduli space. The classes of such
theories have similar spectral curves. This fact allows us to show that all
these models have the same structure of the coupling matrix and to show that
the $N_f=2N_c$ spectral curve can not be presented as a double covering of the
sphere. We calculate first instanton contributions to the coupling matrix and
get nonperturbative $\beta$-functions in the $SU(2)$ gauge theory with non-zero
bare masses of the matter hypermultiplets.
