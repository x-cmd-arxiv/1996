  Theory","64 pages, latex, 11 eps-figures appended as uuencoded file, german
  hyphenation corrected II",,,"DESY 96-115","acc-phys physics.acc-ph",,"  This report provides a description of unbunched beam stochastic cooling in
the framework of control theory. The main interest in the investigation is
concentrated on the beam stability in an active cooling system. A stochastic
cooling system must be considered as a closed-loop, similar to the feedback
systems used to damp collective instabilities. These systems, which are able to
act upon themselves, are potentially unstable.
  The self-consistent solution for the beam motion is derived by means of a
mode analysis of the collective beam motion. This solution yields a criterion
for the stability of each collective mode. The expressions also allow for
overlapping frequency bands in the beam spectrum and thus are valid over the
entire frequency range.
  Having established the boundaries of stability in this way, the Fokker-Planck
equation is used to describe the cooling process. This description does not
include collective effects and thus a stable beam must be assumed. Hence the
predictions about the cooling process following from the Fokker-Planck equation
only make physical sense within the boundaries of beam stability. Finally it is
verified that the parameters of the cooling system which give the best cooling
results are compatible with the stability of the beam.

compressibility arising from a small effective polytropic exponent $\gamma_e$
due to cooling. In the limit of small $\gamma_e$, the density jump at shocks is
shown to be of the order of $e^{M^2}$. Without self-gravity, the density
structures arising in the moderately compressible case consist mostly of
patches separated by shocks and behaving like waves, while in the highly
compressible case clearly defined long-lived object-like clouds emerge. When
the forcing in the momentum equation is purely compressible, the rotational
energy decays monotonically in time, indicating that the vortex-stretching term
is not efficient in transferring energy to rotational modes. This property may
be at the origin of the low amount of rotation found in interstellar clouds.
Vorticity production is found to rely heavily on the presence of additional
terms in the equations. In the presence of self-gravity, we suggest that
turbulence can produce bound structures for $\gamma_e < 2(1-1/n)$, where $n$ is
the typical dimensionality of the turbulent compressions. We support this
result by means of numerical simulations in which, for sufficiently small
$\gamma_e$, small-scale turbulent density fluctuations eventually collapse even
though the medium is globally stable. This result is preserved in the presence
of a magnetic field for supercritical mass-to-flux ratios. At larger polytropic
exponents, turbulence alone is not capable of producing bound structures, and
collapse can only occur when the medium is globally unstable. This mechanism is
a plausible candidate for the differentiation between primordial and
present-day stellar-cluster formation and for the low efficiency of star
formation.

enhancement of the cross section as occurs in the phenomenon of critical
opalescence. Transport properties such as viscosity, mean free paths and
thermal relaxation times are calculated. Strangeness enhancement is
investigated via the chemical relaxation times, which are found to be
considerably higher than those calculated via perturbative QCD. A comparison
with the experimental values for the strangeness enhancement in $S+S$
collisions leads to an upper limit of 4~fm/$c$ for the lifetime of the plasma.
