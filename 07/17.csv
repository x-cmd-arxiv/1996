at 6 cm. Since our last report in 1992, there have been 32 additional
observations, in which both images have returned to their quiescent flux
density levels and the A image has brightened again. We estimate the time delay
from the light curves using three different techniques: the chi-squared
analysis of Press, Rybicki, & Hewitt (1992a,b), the dispersion analysis of Pelt
et al. (1994, 1996), and the locally normalized discrete correlation function
of Leh\'ar et al. (1992). Confidence intervals for these time delay estimates
are found using Monte Carlo techniques. With the addition of the new
observations, it has become obvious that five observations from Spring 1990 are
not consistent with the statistical properties of the rest of the light curves,
so we analyze the light curves with those points removed, as well as the
complete light curves. The three statistical techniques applied to the two
versions of the data set result in time delay values in the range 398 to 461
days (or 1.09 to 1.26 years, A leading B), each with ~5% formal uncertainty.
The corresponding flux ratios (B/A) are in the range 0.698 to 0.704. Thus, the
new features in the light curve show that the time delay is less than 500 days,
in contrast with analysis of earlier versions of the radio light curves. The
large range in the time delay estimates is primarily due to unfortunate
coincidences of observing gaps with flux variations.
