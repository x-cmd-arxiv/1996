  ""Microwave Background Anisotropies"", Les Arcs, France",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We examine how the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect of clusters can probe
$\Omega_{o}$. Using self-consistent models of X-ray clusters in the context of
hierarchical models of structure formation, we show that both the mean Compton
{\it y} parameter and the number of clusters observed via the SZ effect
strongly depend on $\Omega_{o}$. These quantities are higher in open
cosmological models due to the earlier epoch of structure formation.
Specifically, we compare two models which are able to reproduce the present
abundance of X-ray clusters, one for $\Omega_{o}=0.2$ and the other $\Omega =
1$. For $\Omega_{o}=0.2$, ${\ymean}$ exceeds the current FIRAS limit of
$1.5\times10^{-5}$. Also, the SZ redshift source distribution considerably
differs in the two cosmological models. Thus, these results show that both an
improvement in our knowledge of CMB spectral distortions and the realization of
millimeter surveys to look for SZ sources over a large area of the sky should
produce interesting constraints on $\Omega_{o}$ and on the evolution of the
baryonic fractionof virialized structures.

large voltage is applied across it. We present a linear stability analysis for
this system. The forces driving convection are due to the interaction of the
applied electric field with space charge which develops near the free surfaces.
Our analysis is similar to that for the two-dimensional B\'enard problem, but
with important differences due to coupling between the charge distribution and
the field. We find the neutral stability boundary of a dimensionless control
parameter ${\cal R}$ as a function of the dimensionless wave number ${\kappa}$.
${\cal R}$, which is proportional to the square of the applied voltage, is
analogous to the Rayleigh number. The critical values ${{\cal R}_c}$ and
${\kappa_c}$ are found from the minimum of the stability boundary, and its
curvature at the minimum gives the correlation length ${\xi_0}$. The
characteristic time scale ${\tau_0}$, which depends on a second dimensionless
parameter ${\cal P}$, analogous to the Prandtl number, is determined from the
linear growth rate near onset. ${\xi_0}$ and ${\tau_0}$ are coefficients in the
Ginzburg-Landau amplitude equation which describes the flow pattern near onset
in this system. We compare our results to recent experiments.
