magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) shocks. These calculations are based on extension
to oblique shocks of a numerical model for ``thermal leakage'' injection of
particles at low energy into the cosmic-ray population. That technique,
incorporated into a fully dynamical diffusion-convection formalism, was
recently introduced for parallel shocks by Kang \& Jones (1995). Here, we have
compared results of time dependent numerical simulations using our technique
with Monte Carlo simulations by Ellison, Baring \& Jones 1995 and with {\it in
situ} observations from the Ulysses spacecraft of oblique interplanetary shocks
discussed by Baring \etal (1995). Through the success of these comparisons we
have demonstrated that our {diffusion-convection} method and injection
techniques provide a practical tool to capture essential physics of the
injection process and particle acceleration at oblique MHD shocks. In addition
to the diffusion-convection simulations, we have included time dependent
two-fluid simulations for a couple of the shocks to demonstrate the basic
validity of that formalism in the oblique shock context. Using simple models
for the two-fluid closure parameters based on test-particle considerations, we
find good agreement with the dynamical properties of the more detailed
diffusion-convection results. We emphasize, however, that such two-fluid
results can be sensitive to the properties of these closure parameters when the
flows are not truly steady. Furthermore, we emphasize through example how the
validity of the two-fluid formalism does not necessarily mean that {\it
steady-state} two-fluid models provide a reliable tool for predicting the
efficiency of particle acceleration in real shocks.

into the black hole forming a quasi-spherical flow or a simple disk-like
structure around it. When the flow has a large angular momentum (typically,
larger than the marginally bound value, $\lambda\gsim\lambda_{mb}$), almost no
accretion into the black hole occurs. Instead, the flow produces a stable
standing shock with one or more vortices behind it and is deflected away at the
shock as a conical outgoing wind of higher entropy. If the flow has an angular
momentum somewhat smaller than $\lambda_{mb}$
$(\lambda_{u}\lsim\lambda\lsim\lambda_{mb})$, a fraction (typically, $5-10$\%)
of the incoming material is accreted into the black hole, but the the flow

the deflected material is accreted back into the black hole, while the rest is

progressively more dominant in lower luminosity ellipticals. We find that
so-called ""supersoft"" sources adhere to the observed kT-sigma relation, so they

classify faint distant galaxies according to morphological type. These
observations have revealed a large population of galaxies classed as irregulars
or which show signs of recent merger activity. Their abundance rises steeply
with apparent magnitude, providing a likely explanation for the large number of
blue galaxies seen at faint magnitudes. We demonstrate that such a population
arises naturally in a model in which structure forms hierarchically and which
is dynamically dominated by cold dark matter. The number counts of irregular,
spiral and elliptical galaxies as a function of magnitude seen in the HST data

self-consistently into account the feedback on the underlying accretion disc.
It is shown that such jets are mostly described by the ejection index $\xi=
\mbox{d} \ln \dot M_a/ \mbox{d}\ln r$, which is a local measure of the disc
ejection efficiency. This parameter is found to lie in a very narrow range, due
to global disc-jets constraints. This investigation provided two important
results. First, the disc vertical equilibrium imposes a minimum mass flux
ejected. Second, their asymptotic behaviour critically depends on a fastness
parameter $\omega_A= \Omega_*r_A /V_{Ap,A}$, ratio of the field lines rotation
velocity to the poloidal Alfv\'en velocity at the Alfv\'en surface. This
parameter must be bigger than, but of the order of, unity. Self-similar jets
from Keplerian discs, after widening up to a maximum radius whose value
increases with $\omega_A$, always recollimate towards the jet axis, until the
fast-magnetosonic critical point is reached. It is doubtful that such solutions
could steadily cross this last point, the jet either ending there or
rebouncing. Recollimation takes place because of the increasing effect of
magnetic constriction. This systematic behaviour is due to the large opening of
the magnetic surfaces, leading to such an efficient acceleration that matter
always reaches its maximum poloidal velocity. This ``over-widening'' stems from
having the same ejection efficiency $\xi$ in the whole jet. Realistic jets, fed
with ejection indices varying from one magnetic surface to the other, would not
undergo recollimation, allowing either cylindrical or parabolic asymptotic
collimation.

learning is a form of supervised learning based on similarity-based reasoning.
The part of speech tag of a word in a particular context is extrapolated from
the most similar cases held in memory. Supervised learning approaches are
useful when a tagged corpus is available as an example of the desired output of
the tagger. Based on such a corpus, the tagger-generator automatically builds a
tagger which is able to tag new text the same way, diminishing development time
for the construction of a tagger considerably. Memory-based tagging shares this
advantage with other statistical or machine learning approaches. Additional
advantages specific to a memory-based approach include (i) the relatively small
tagged corpus size sufficient for training, (ii) incremental learning, (iii)
explanation capabilities, (iv) flexible integration of information in case
representations, (v) its non-parametric nature, (vi) reasonably good results on
unknown words without morphological analysis, and (vii) fast learning and
tagging. In this paper we show that a large-scale application of the
memory-based approach is feasible: we obtain a tagging accuracy that is on a
par with that of known statistical approaches, and with attractive space and
time complexity properties when using {\em IGTree}, a tree-based formalism for
indexing and searching huge case bases.} The use of IGTree has as additional
advantage that optimal context size for disambiguation is dynamically computed.

the hierarchy among the vacuum mass eigenvalues $\mu_3^2 \gg \mu_2^2 \geq

$\delta_{31}=\mu_3^2 - \mu_1^2$ and the $13$ and $23$ mixing angles $\phi$ and
$\psi$. Whereas the sub-GeV atmospheric neutrino data imposes only a lower
limit on $\delta_{31} > 10^{-3} eV^2$, the zenith angle dependent suppression
observed in the multi-GeV data limits $\delta_{31}$ from above also. The
allowed regions of the parameter space are strongly constrained by the
multi-GeV data. Combined with our earlier solution to the solar neutrino
problem which depends on $\delta_{21}= \mu_2^2-\mu_1^2$ and the $12$ and $13$

Moreover, this hypothetical source is not formed in the dynamical evolution of
the system.

  by H. Stoecker, to appear in the proceedings of the 1st Catania Relativistic
  Ion Studies (CRIS '96), Catania (Italy), May 27-31 1996",,,,"nucl-th",,"  Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) calculations of central collisions between
heavy nuclei are used to study fragment production and the creation of
collective flow. It is shown that the final phase space distributions are
compatible with the expectations from a thermally equilibrated source, which in
addition exhibits a collective transverse expansion. However, the microscopic
analyses of the transient states in the intermediate reaction stages show that
the event shapes are more complex and that equilibrium is reached only in very
special cases but not in event samples which cover a wide range of impact
parameters as it is the case in experiments. The basic features of a new
molecular dynamics model (UQMD) for heavy ion collisions from the Fermi energy
regime up to the highest presently available energies are outlined.

  Poland, 10-14 May 1996","Acta Phys.Polon.B27:2893-2910,1996",,,"nucl-th",,"  A brief overview on recent model calculations for near threshold pion
production in nucleon-nucleon collisions is given. Results from our own
investigations of the reactions $pp \rightarrow pp\pi ^0$ and $pn \rightarrow
d\pi^0$ are presented. Direct production, heavy meson exchange and pion
rescattering are taken into account. For the latter a T-matrix obtained from a
microscopic model of the $\pi N$ interaction is employed. We obtain a
significant contribution from rescattering, but not enough to describe the data
for $pp \to pp\pi^0$. The missing production rate can be provided by heavy
meson exchanges. For the first time the effect of off--shell rescattering is
investigated for the reaction $pn \rightarrow d\pi^0$. Isoscalar rescattering
in combination with isovector rescattering is able to describe the s-wave
production data. We confirm that heavy meson exchanges are negligible in this
reaction.

reaction-diffusion system of the activator-inhibitor type in which domain
patterns can form. We showed that both multidomain and labyrinthine patterns
may form spontaneously as a result of Turing instability. In the stable
homogeneous system with the fast inhibitor one can excite both localized and
extended patterns by applying a localized stimulus. Depending on the parameters
and the excitation level of the system stripes, spots, wriggled stripes, or
labyrinthine patterns form. The labyrinthine patterns may be both connected and
disconnected. In the the stable homogeneous system with the slow inhibitor one
can excite self-replicating spots, breathing patterns, autowaves and
turbulence. The parameter regions in which different types of patterns are
realized are explained on the basis of the asymptotic theory of instabilities
for patterns with sharp interfaces developed by us in Phys. Rev. E. 53, 3101
(1996). The dynamics of the patterns observed in our simulations is very
similar to that of the patterns forming in the ferrocyanide-iodate-sulfite
reaction.
