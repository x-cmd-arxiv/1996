data (EWs from high-res CCD spectra) was re-analyzed in a self-consistent way
to integrate our data and derive new [Fe/H] for more than 160 bright red giants

quality, direct spectroscopic data, on updated model atmospheres from the grid
of Kurucz (1992) and on a careful fine abundance analysis (using a common set
of atomic and atmospheric parameters for all stars). Given the high internal
homogeneity, our new scale supersedes the discrepancies of previous attempts.
The internal uncertainty in [Fe/H] is very small: 0.06 dex (24 GCs) on average,
that can be interpreted as the mean precision of cluster ranking. Compared to
our system, metallicities on the widely used Zinn and West's scale are about
0.10dex higher for [Fe/H]$>-1$, 0.23dex lower for $-1<[Fe/H]<-1.9$ and 0.11dex
too high for [Fe/H]$<-1.9$: the non-linearity is significant at 3$\sigma$
level. A quadratic transformation corrects older values to the new scale in the
range of our calibrating GCs ($-2.24\le[Fe/H]_{ZW}\le-0.51$). A minor
disagreement is found at low [Fe/H] between the metallicity scale based on
field and cluster RR Lyrae's (via a new calibration of the $\Delta$S index) and
our new GCs metallicities, that could be ascribed to non-linearity in the
[Fe/H]$-\Delta$S relationship. The impact of new metallicities on major

phase in which a current circulates in each unit cell. This phase preserves the
translational symmetry of the lattice while breaking time-reversal invariance
and the four-fold rotational symmetry. The product of time-reversal and
four-fold rotation is preserved. The circulating current phase terminates at a
critical point at $x=x_c, T=0$. In the quantum-critical region about this point
the logarithm of the frequency of the current fluctuations scales with their
momentum. The microscopic basis for the marginal Fermi-liquid phenemenology and
the observed long wavelength transport anomalies near $x=x_c$ are derived from
such fluctuations. The symmetry of the current fluctuations is such that the
associated magnetic field fluctuations are absent at oxygen sites and have the
correct form to explain the anomalous copper nuclear relaxation rate.
Cross-overs to the Fermi-liquid phase on either side of $x_c$ and the role of
disorder are briefly considered. The current fluctuations promote
superconductive instability with a propensity towards ``D-wave"" symmetry or

situation is handled with the Keldysh time-loop perturbation formalism in
conjunction with appropriate coupling methods for tunneling systems due to

across the junction leads to an interference of several fundamental
oscillations, such that in this tunneling geometry, it is possible to tune the
interaction between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling at a fixed
impurity configuration, simply by changing the bias across the junction.
Furthermore, it is shown that the range of the RKKY interaction is altered out

that new physics decouples well above the electroweak scale. Supersymmetric
extension of the Standard Model offers the possibility of light chargino and
the right-handed stop (with masses below $M_Z$), and still maintaining the
successful predictions of the Standard Model. The value of $R_b$ can then be
enhanced up to $\sim 0.218$ (the Standard Model value is $\sim 0.216$). Light
chargino and stop give important contribution to rare processes such as
$b\rightarrow s \gamma$, $\overline K^0-K^0$ and $\overline B^0-B^0$ mixing but
consistency with experimental results is maintained in a large region of the
parameter space. The exotic four-jet events reported by ALEPH (if confirmed)
may constitute a signal for supersymmetry with such a light spectrum and with
explicitly broken $R-$parity. Their interpretation as pair production of
charginos with $m_C\sim 60$ GeV, with subsequent decay $C\rightarrow \tilde t_R
b \rightarrow dsb$ (where $m_{\tilde t}\sim 55$ GeV) leads to signatures very
close to the experimental observations.

  $\alpha^{-1}=136._8\pm 9","25 figures, 252 pages, Ph.D. thesis",,,"NBI-HE-96-40","hep-ph",,"  The Multiple Point Criticality Principle (MPCP) states that action parameters
- in for example a field theory - take on values corresponding to the junction
of a maximum number of phases in the phase diagram of a system that undergoes
phase transitions. The phases to which physical significance is ascribed are
normally regarded as artifacts of a regulation procedure. In the context of a
Y-M lattice gauge theory, the MPCP is applied to the system of different
(Planck scale) lattice phases that can be provoked using a suitably generalised
action with a gauge group that is taken to be the Planck scale predecessor to
the Standard Model Group (SMG) - namely the $N_{gen}$-fold Cartesian product of
the SMG. Here $N_{gen}$ is the number of fermion generations. Ambiguities under
mappings of the gauge group $SGM^{N_{gen}}$ onto itself result in the Planck
scale breakdown to the diagonal subgroup which is isomorphic to the usual SMG.
Assuming the validity of the MPCP, the three SMG gauge couplings at the Planck
scale are predicted to be equal to the diagonal subgroup couplings correspond-
ing to the multiple point action parameters in a lattice gauge theory with the
gauge group $SMG^{N_{gen}}$. This prediction gives agreement with experiment to
within 10 \% for the non-Abelian couplings and 5\% for the U(1) gauge coup-
ling. In a more general context, the MPCP is proposed as a fundamental princi-
ple of Nature that can also explain other fine-tuning enigma in high energy
physics. It is argued that the MPCP implies having long range nonlocal inter-
actions which are identical between fields at all pairs of spacetime points.
Such interactions are allowed in a very general form of a reparameterization
invariant action. This phenomenologically unobjectionable form of nonlocality
would quite naturally be incorporated into our theory as constants of Nature.

approach. We test various equations of state (EOSs), which are used to describe
the strongly interacting matter at densities attainable in the CERN-SPS heavy
ion experiments. For each EOS, suitable initial conditions can be determined to
reproduce the experimental hadron spectra; this emphasizes the ambiguity
between the initial conditions and the EOS in such an approach. Simultaneously,
we calculate the resulting thermal photon and dielectron spectra, and compare
with experiments. If one allows the excitation of resonance states with
increasing temperature, the electro-magnetic signals from scenarios with and
without phase transition are very similar and are not resolvable within the
current experimental resolution. With regard to the CERES dilepton data, none
of the EOSs considered, in conjunction with the standard leading order dilepton
rates, succeed in reproducing the observed excess of dileptons below the rho
peak. Our work, however, suggests that an improved measurement of the photon
and dilepton spectra has the potential to strongly constrain the EOS.

observed in nuclear rotational bands. We examine six super- and hyper-deformed
bands, among which that of 149Gd and possibly of 147Gd seem to exhibit real
staggering. However, we emphasize that the presence of staggering may not
necessarily imply the occurrence of bifurcation. It is also shown that a
similar staggering seen in normally deformed bands is a manifestation of band
crossings. A more extensive analysis is planned.

the core of a massive star. At birth, the hot and high density matter in such a
star contains a large number of neutrinos trapped during collapse. Trapped
neutrinos generally inhibit the presence of exotic matter -- hyperons, a kaon
condensate, or quarks. However, as the neutrinos diffuse out in about 10-15 s,
the threshold for the appearance of strangeness is reduced; hence, the
composition and the structure of the star can change significantly. The effect
of exotic, negatively-charged, strangeness-bearing components is always to
soften the equation of state, and the possibility exists that the star
collapses to a black hole at this time. This could explain why no neutron star
has yet been seen in the remnant of supernova SN1987A, even though one
certainly existed when neutrinos were detected on Feb. 23, 1987. With new
generation neutrino detectors it is feasible to test different theoretical
scenarios observationally.

  Press, 1997, pp. 404-415",,,"q-alg math.QA",,"  Quantization, at least in some formulations, involves replacing some algebra
of observables by a (more non-commutative) deformed algebra. In view of the
fundamental role played by K-theory in non-commutative geometry and topology,
it is of interest to ask to what extent K-theory remains ""rigid"" under this
process. We show that some positive results can be obtained using ideas of
Gabber, Gillet-Thomason, and Suslin. From this we derive that the algebraic
K-theory with finite coefficients of a deformation quantization of the
functions on a compact symplectic manifold, forgetting the topology, recovers
the topological K-theory of the manifold.

estimates suggested that fluctuations in the space-time metric on the scale of
the Planck time (10^-44s) could be detected using atom interferometers. In this
paper we first specify a stochastic metric obtained from fluctuations that
propagate with the velocity of light, and then develop the non-Markovian
quantum state diffusion theory required to estimate the resulting decoherence
effects on a model matter interferometer. Both commuting and non-commuting
fluctuations are considered. The effects of the latter are so large that if
they applied to some real atom interferometry experiments they would have
suppressed the observed interference. The model is too crude to conclude that
such fluctuations do not exist, but it does demonstrate that the small
numerical value of the Planck time does not alone prevent experimental access
to Planck-scale phenomena in the laboratory.
