non--singular integral equations. A non--singular formulation, via Fredholm's
theory, guarantees uniqueness and provides a mathematically firm foundation for
both numerical and analytic studies. We compare and contrast our reformulation,
based on the exact solution for the wedge, with the standard singular integral
equations using numerical discretisation techniques. We consider in detail the
(integrable) equilateral triangle and the Pythagorean 3-4-5 triangle. Our
non--singular formulation produces results which are well behaved
mathematically. In contrast, while resolving the eigenvalues very well, the
standard approach displays various behaviours demonstrating the need for some
sort of ``renormalisation''. The non-singular formulation provides a
mathematically firm basis for the generation and analysis of periodic orbit
expansions. We discuss their convergence paying particular emphasis to the
computational effort required in comparision with Einstein--Brillouin--Keller
quantisation and the standard discretisation, which is analogous to the method
of Bogomolny. We also discuss the generalisation of our technique to smooth,
chaotic billiards.

(degenerate BESS) which, in this limit, decouples giving rise to the Higgsless
Standard Model (SM). Otherwise we can get a model which decouples giving the

true also at the level of radiative corrections. Therefore the model discussed

scale and the $M_Z$ scale. The gauge group underlying the phase diagram in
which we seek multiple point values of action parameters is what we call the
Anti Grand Unified Theory (AGUT) gauge group $SMG^3$ which is the Cartesian
product of 3 standard model groups (SMGs). There is one SMG factor for each of
the $N_{gen}=3$ generations of quarks and leptons. In our model, this gauge
group $SMG^3$ is the predecessor to the usual standard model group. The latter
arises as the diagonal subgroup surviving the Planck scale breakdown of $SMG^3.
This breakdown leads to a weakening of the $U(1)$ coupling by a
$N_{gen}$-related factor. The most important correction obtained from using
multiple point parameter values (in a multi-parameter phase diagram instead of
the single critical parameter value obtained say in the 1-dimensional phase
diagram of a Wilson action) comes from including the influence of having phases
confined solely w.r.t. discrete subgroups. In particular, what matters is that
the degree of first-orderness is taken into account in making the transition
from these latter phases at the multiple point to the totally Coulomb-like
phase. Combined with the results of earlier work on the non-Abelian gauge
couplings, the results presented here lead to our prediction of
$\alpha^{-1}=136._8\pm 9$ as the value for the fine-structure constant at low

theorem concerning to the existence of spinor structures in a Lorentzian

and compare these with DHSF, showing that all the three kinds of spinor fields
contain the same mathematical and physical information. We clarify also the
notion of (Crumeyrolle's) amorphous spinors (Dirac-K\""ahler spinor fields are
of this type), showing that they cannot be used to describe fermionic fields.
We develop a rigorous theory for the covariant derivatives of Clifford fields

show how to generalize the original Dirac-Hestenes equation in Minkowski
