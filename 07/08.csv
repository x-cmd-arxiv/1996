to have regular, two-arm spiral structure to a radius of 4 kpc in the near
infrared, with an arm-interarm contrast of 1.3. The spiral structure in all
four galaxies is weaker than that in grand design galaxies. Taken in unbarred
galaxies with no large, nearby companions, these data are consistent with the
modal theory of spiral density waves, which maintains that density waves are
intrinsic to the disk. As an alternative, mechanisms for driving spiral
structure with non-axisymmetric perturbers are also discussed. These

the range of physical environments in which large-scale dynamical processes,
such as density waves, are important.

Lagrangian using lattice QCD with Wilson fermions. This procedure requires the
introduction of a lattice chiral Lagrangian as an intermediate step in the
calculation. The QCD chiral Lagrangian is then obtained by expanding the
lattice effective theory in increasing powers of the lattice spacing and the
external momenta. In order to investigate the consequences of the chiral
symmetry breaking induced by the Wilson term, we study the lattice chiral
Lagrangian at the leading order of the strong coupling and large $N$ expansion.
We show that the effects of the Wilson term can be conveniently taken into
account, in the lattice effective theory, by a suitable renormalization
procedure. In particular, we show that, at the leading order of the strong
coupling and large N expansion, the chiral symmetry is exactly recovered on the
lattice provided that the bare quark mass and the lattice operators are
properly renormalized.

its absorptive part along the branch cut. In perturbative calculations, the
latter may be constructed by means of Cutkosky's rule, which is briefly
discussed. For illustration, we apply this procedure at one loop to the photon
vacuum-polarization function induced by leptons as well as to the $\gamma f\bar
f$ vertex form factor generated by the exchange of a massive vector boson
between the two fermion legs. We also show how the hadronic contribution to the
photon vacuum polarization may be extracted from the total cross section of
hadron production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation measured as a function of energy.
Finally, we outline the application of dispersive techniques at the two-loop
level, considering as an example the bosonic decay width of a high-mass Higgs
boson.

algebra of a semisimple coadjoint orbit. In the first section we use the
representation of the Lie algebra on a generalized Verma module to quantize the
Kirillov bracket on the family of semisimple coadjoint orbits of a given orbit
type. In the second section we extend this construction to define a deformation
in the category of representations of the quantized enveloping algebra. In an
earlier paper we used cohomological methods to prove the existence of a two
parameter family quantizing a compatible pair of Poisson brackets on any
symmetric coadjoint orbit. This paper gives a more explicit algebraic
construction which includes more general orbit types and which we prove to be
flat in all parameters.

  figure available at request from fizrh@univ.gda.pl",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.54.1838",,"quant-ph",,"  Information-theoretic aspects of quantum inseparability of mixed states are
investigated in terms of the $\alpha$-entropy inequalities and teleportation
fidelity. Inseparability of mixed states is defined and a complete
characterization of the inseparable $2\times2$ systems with maximally
disordered subsystems is presented within the Hilbert-Schmidt space formalism.
A connection between teleportation and negative conditional $\alpha$-entropy is
also emphasized.
