fluid systems with magnetic fields. We consider wave-like perturbations to
nonuniform filamentary and sheet-like hydrostatic equilibria in the presence of
a uniform parallel magnetic field. Motivated by observations of molecular
clouds that suggest substantial nonthermal (turbulent) pressure, we adopt
equations of state that are softer than isothermal. We numerically determine
the dispersion relation and the form of the perturbations in the regime of
instability. The form of the dispersion relation is the same for all equations
of state considered, for all magnetic field strengths, and for both geometries
examined. We demonstrate the existence of a fastest growing mode for the system
and study how its characteristics depend on the amount of turbulence and the
strength of the magnetic field. Generally, turbulence tends to increase the
rate and the length scale of fragmentation. While tending to slow the
fragmentation, the magnetic field has little effect on the fragmentation length
scale until reaching some threshold, above which the length scale decreases
significantly. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for star
formation in molecular clouds.

  the Schr\""odinger Method","14 pages, 10 postscript figures, submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The Schr\""odinger Method is a novel approach for modeling numerically
self-gravitating, collisionless systems that may have certain advantages over
N-body and phase space methods. In particular, smoothing is part of the
dynamics and not just the force calculation. This paper describes test-bed
simulations which illustrate the viability of the Schr\""odinger Method. We
develop the techniques necessary to handle ``hot'' systems as well as
spherically symmetric systems. We demonstrate that the method can maintain a
stable, equilibrium star cluster by constructing and then evolving a Plummer
sphere. We also consider nonequilibrium initial conditions and follow the
system as it attempts to reach virial equilibrium through phase mixing and
violent relaxation. Finally we make a few remarks concerning the dynamics of
axions and other bosonic dark matter candidates. The Schr\""odinger Method, in
principle, provides an exact treatment of these fields. However such ``scalar
field'' simulations are feasible and warrented only if the deBroglie wavelength
of the particle is comparable to the size of the system of interest, a
situation that is almost certainly not the case for axions in the Galaxy.
Therefore the Schr\""odinger Method treats axions in the same way as other
collisionless particles. We challenge recent claims in the literature that
axions in the Galaxy form soliton stars.

cooling jets propagating into stratified isothermal ambient media with
power-law density and pressure distributions. The parameters used are mainly
suitable for protostellar jets but results applicable to extragalactic jets are
also presented. Comparisons are made with previous simulations of jets through
homogeneous media. We find that for radiative cooling jets propagating into
regions where the ambient medium has an increasing density (and pressure)
gradient, the ambient gas tends to compress the cold, low-pressure cocoon of
shocked material that surrounds the beam and destroy the bow shock-like
structure at the head. The compressing medium collimates the jet and promotes
the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities which cause beam focusing,
wiggling and the formation of internal traveling shocks, $close$ $to$ $the$
$head$, via pinching along the beam. This remarkably resembles the structure of
some observed systems (e.g. Haro 6-5B northern and HH 24G jets). These effects
are larger for jets with smaller density ratio between jet and environment
$\eta $ (tested for $\eta $=1, 3, and 10) and larger Mach number $M_a=v_j/c_a$
(tested for $M_a=$12 and 24, where $v_j$ is the jet velocity and $c_a$ the
ambient sound speed). In an ambient medium of decreasing density (and
pressure), the beam is poorly collimated and relaxes, becoming faint. This
could explain ''invisible'' jet sections, like the gap between the parent
source and collimated beam (e.g., in HH30 jet). Although, on average, jets
propagating into an increasing (decreasing) density environment are decelerated
(accelerated) by the increasing (decreasing) ram pressure of the ambient
medium, we find that their propagation velocities have an oscillating pattern.

Such grains can be aligned by gaseous torques during the short periods of
crossovers and/or due to the difference in the rate at which atoms arrive at
grain surface. The latter is a result of the difference in orientation of a
grain in respect to the supersonic flow. This process, which we call
cross-section alignment, is the subject of our present paper. We derive
expressions for the measure of cross-section alignment for oblate grains and

energies, charge and spin density distributions, bond orders, charge-charge and
spin-spin correlations, in the ground state for different parameters of the
model. The effect of bond alternation and site-diagonal distortion on the
ground state properties are considered in detail. We observe that the
site-diagonal distortion plays a significant role in deciding the nature of the
ground state of the system. We find that while the $CDW$ and $BOW$ phases can
coexist, the $CDW$ and $SDW$ phases are exclusive in most of the cases. We have
also studied the doped $MX$ chains both with and without bond alternation and
site-diagonal distortion in the $CDW$ as well as $SDW$ regimes. We find that
the additional charge in the polarons and bipolarons for hole doping are
confined to a few sites, in the presence of bond alternation and site-diagonal
distortion. For electron doping, we find that the additional charge(s) is(are)
smeared over the entire chain length and although energetics imply a
disproportionation of the negatively charged bipolaron, the charge and spin
density distributions do not reflect it. Positively charged bipolaron
disproportionates into two polarons in the $SDW$ region. There is also bond
order evidence for compression of bond length for the positively charged

demonstrated to converge after a certain well defined time in the evolution. A
dynamic description of the mode-excitation is introduced and tested. 2) It is
shown how a straightforward low-frequency approximation to the integral along
the branch cut in the black-hole Green's function leads to the anticipated
power-law fall off at very late times. We also calculate higher order

the leading order. 3) The high-frequency problem is also considered. We
demonstrate that the combination of the obtained approximations for the

  In this paper, an important subspace of the latter is disentangled: The
superspace of local homogenous Riemannian 3-geometries. It is finite
dimensional and can be factored by conformal scale dilations, with the flat
space as the center of projection. The corresponding moduli space can be
represented by homothetically normalized 3-geometries.
  By construction, this moduli space of the local homogenous 3-geometries is an
algebraic variety. An explicit parametrization is given by characteristic
scalar invariants of the Riemannian 3-geometry.
  Although the moduli space is not locally Euclidean, it is a Hausdorff space.
Nevertheless, its topology is compatible with the non-Hausdorffian topology of
the space of all Bianchi-Lie algebras, which characterize the moduli modulo
differences in their anisotropy.

concise superfield notation our previously obtained expression for the exact
classical interaction between n ADHM superinstantons mediated by the adjoint
Higgs bosons, and moreover, to incorporate N_F flavors of hypermultiplets. We
perform explicit 1- and 2-instanton checks of the Seiberg-Witten prepotentials
for all N_F and arbitrary hypermultiplet masses. Our results for the low-energy
couplings are all in precise agreement with the predictions of Seiberg and
Witten except for N_F=4, where we find a finite renormalization of the coupling
which is absent in the proposed solution.

motion in heavy-ion fusion reactions at near-barrier energies is investigated.
The coupled channels equations are solved to all orders, and also in the linear
and the quadratic coupling approximations. Taking $^{64}$Ni + $^{92,96}$Zr
reactions as examples, it is shown that all order couplings lead to
considerably improved agreement with the experimentally measured fusion cross
sections and average angular momenta of the compound nucleus for such heavy
nearly symmetric systems. The importance of higher order coupling is also
examined for asymmetric systems like $^{16}$O + $^{112}$Cd, $^{144}$Sm, for
which previous calculations of the fusion cross section seemed to indicate that
the linear coupling approximation was adequate. It is shown that the shape of
the barrier distributions and the energy dependence of the average angular
momentum can change significantly when the higher order couplings are included,
even for systems where measured fusion cross sections may seem to be well
reproduced by the linear coupling approximation.

correlation function of the nuclear surface fluctuations is evaluated in a
simple model of an incompressible and irrotational Fermi liquid. The dependence
of the spectral correlation function on the dynamical Fermi-surface distortion
is established. The temperature at which the eigenvibrations become overdamped
is calculated. It is shown that, for realistic values of the relaxation time

nonlinear, open-flow system is analyzed: The spatiotemporal structures of
rotationally symmetric vortices that propagate downstream in the annulus of the
rotating Taylor-Couette system due to an externally imposed axial through-flow
are investigated for two different axial boundary conditions at the in- and
outlet. Unlike the stationary patterns in systems without through-flow the
spatiotemporal structures of propagating vortices are independent of parameter
history, initial conditions, and system's length. They do, however, depend on
the axial boundary conditions, the driving rate of the inner cylinder and the
through-flow rate. Our analysis of the amplitude equation shows that the
pattern selection can be described by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with the
frequency being the eigenvalue. Approaching the border between absolute and
convective instability the eigenvalue problem becomes effectively linear and
the selection mechanism approaches that one of linear front propagation.
