oxygen abundance in central brightest part of the galaxy is found to be 12 +
log(O/H) = 7.33+-0.01. The N/O, Ne/O, S/O and Ar/O abundance ratios are close
to those derived in other BCGs, suggesting that heavy element enrichment in the
HII region is due to massive star evolution. We detect auroral [OIII] 4363
emission in the inner part of HII region with a diameter of 3.6 kpc and find
that the HII region inside this diameter is hot, T_e~20000K. The oxygen
abundance in this region is nearly constant (12 + log(O/H) = 7.1 - 7.3),
implying effective mixing of ionized gas on short time-scales. We also discuss
the origin of blue underlying extended low-intensity emission detected in SBS

contribution to the extended envelope is due to ionized gas emission. However,
the observed equivalent width of Hbeta emission in the extended envelope is 2-3
times lower than the value expected in the case of pure gaseous emission. These
findings suggest that, along with the blue young (~10^7yr) stellar clusters, an
older stellar population with age ~10^8yr may be present in the extended
envelope of SBS 0335-052, having a total mass conclude that SBS 0335-052 is a

relative to the fluence of Peak 1, there is a small but statistically
significant trend for both to decrease with energy relative to Peak 1 over the
near-infrared range. We find that the phase separation between the two peaks of
the pulse profile decreases nearly continuously as a function of energy over 7
decades of energy. We show that the peaks' full-width half-maxima are
significantly variable over this energy range, but without any clear pattern to
the variability. We find that the differences between the energy dependences of
the leading and trailing edge half-width half-maxima of both peaks found by
Eikenberry et al. (1996a) also continue over 7 decades of energy. We show that
the cusped shape of Peak 2 reverses direction between the infrared/optical and
X-ray/gamma-ray bands, while the cusped shape of Peak 1 shows weak evidence of
reversing direction between the X-ray and gamma-ray bands. Finally, we find
that many of the pulse shape parameters show maxima or minima at energies of

Ly$\alpha$ emission superposed on even broader Ly$\alpha$ absorption by the HI

scattering of Ly$\alpha$ photons. The BCD appears to be a young galaxy,

the following evidence: 1) the underlying extended low-surface-brightness

of the balls on the line. We find that in the steady state the friction force
acting on the ball is independent of material properties like the Coulomb
friction coefficient and the coefficient of restitution. Contrary to previous
notions about the details of the motion, we find that it is very regular and
consists of many small bounces on each ball on the line. As a result of this
regularity, introducing a random spacing between the balls on the line has
mainly the same influence as a regular spacing of adequate length. The
insensitivity of the steady state velocity to material properties and to the
detailed arrangement of the balls on the line allows for an analytical
estimation of the mean velocity which fits the simulation results very well. We
find that results from the 2D case can probably not be transferred to the 3D

dimensional reduction to 2+2 yields supersymmetric Yang-Mills equations in
which the Poincar\'e supersymmetry is reduced by a null vector. We also give
the corresponding formulation in superspace.

``dynamical Casimir effect'' might provide the driving force behind the
puzzling phenomenon of sonoluminescence. Motivated by that exciting suggestion,
we have computed the static Casimir energy of a spherical cavity in an
otherwise uniform material. As expected the result is divergent; yet a
plausible finite answer is extracted, in the leading uniform asymptotic
approximation. This result agrees with that found using zeta-function
regularization. Numerically, we find far too small an energy to account for the
large burst of photons seen in sonoluminescence. If the divergent result is
retained, it is of the wrong sign to drive the effect. Dispersion does not
resolve this contradiction. In the static approximation, the Fresnel drag term
is zero; on the mother hand, electrostriction could be comparable to the
Casimir term. It is argued that this adiabatic approximation to the dynamical
Casimir effect should be quite accurate.

possible, of renormalized gauge theories. Following a suggestion of Polchinski,
we base our analysis on the Wilson renormalization group method. After a
discussion of the infinite cut-off limit, we study the short distance
properties of the Green functions verifying the validity of Wilson short
distance expansion. We also consider the problem of the extension to the
quantum level of the classical symmetries of the theory. With this purpose we
analyze in details the breakings induced by the cut-off in a $SU(2)$ gauge
symmetry and we prove the possibility of compensating these breakings by a
suitable choice of non-gauge invariant counter terms.

transitions between zero and nonzero chromomagnetic vacua is found ---what is
also confirmed through the calculation of the renormalization group (RG)

Numerical evaluation indicates that for some curvatures the imaginary part of
the effective potential disappears (gravitational stabilization of the

present a detailed parameter study of the YKP parameters for a finite,
hydrodynamically expanding source model of heavy-ion collisions. For the class
of models studied here, we show that the three YKP radius parameters have an
interpretation as longitudinal extension, transverse extension and emission
duration of the source in the YKP frame. This frame is specified by the fourth
fit parameter, the Yano-Koonin velocity which describes to a good approximation
the velocity of the fluid element with highest emissivity and allows to test
for the longitudinal expansion of the source. Deviations from this
interpretation of the YKP parameters are discussed quantitatively.

This implies that the effective range of the potential is non-positive. We also
examine scattering from the sum of two potentials, one of which is a
short-range interaction. We find that if the short-range interaction is of
zero-range then it must be attractive, and the logarithmic derivative of the
radial wave function at the origin must be a monotonically decreasing function
of energy. If the short-range interaction is not of zero range then a
constraint which gives the minimum possible range for it to fit the phase
shifts exists. The implications of these results for effective field theory
treatments of nucleon-nucleon interactions are discussed.
