state) stochastic systems with many degrees of freedom lead to Boltzmann
distributions when the dynamics is expressed in terms of the logarithm of the
normalized elementary variables. In terms of the original variables this gives
a power-law distribution. This mechanism implies certain relations between the
constraints of the system, the power of the distribution and the dispersion law
of the fluctuations. These predictions are validated by Monte Carlo simulations
and experimental data. We speculate that stochastic multiplicative dynamics
might be the natural origin for the emergence of criticality and scale
hierarchies without fine-tuning.

Painlev\'e II equation are discussed by using the bilinear formalism. One of
them is a representation by the Devisme polynomials, and another one is a
Hankel determinant representation. They are derived from the determinant
solutions of the KP hierarchy and Toda lattice, respectively.
