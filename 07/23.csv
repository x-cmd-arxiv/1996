redshift z=1.55 with an estimated age of 3.5 Gyr. This is incompatible with age
estimates for a flat matter dominated universe unless the Hubble constant is
less than $ 45 kms^{-1}Mpc^{-1}$. While both an open universe, and a universe
with a cosmological constant alleviate this problem, I argue here that this
result favors a non-zero cosmological constant, especially when considered in
light of other cosmological constraints. In the first place, for the favored
range of matter densities, this constraint is more stringent than the globular
cluster age constraint, which already favors a non-zero cosmological constant.
Moreover, the age-redshift relation for redshifts of order unity implies that
the ratio between the age associated with redshift 1.55 and the present age is
also generally larger for a cosmological constant dominated universe than for
an open universe. In addition, structure formation is generally suppressed in
low density cosmologies, arguing against early galaxy formation. The additional
constraints imposed by the new observation on the parameter space of $h$ vs
$\Omega_{matter}$ (where $H= 100 h kms^{-1}Mpc^{-1}$) are derived for both
cosmologies. For a cosmological constant dominated universe this constraint is
consistent with the range allowed by other cosmological constraints, which also
favor a non-zero value.

quantifying the relations between morphology and environment. We use
classifications given by five experts for a sample of 827 APM galaxies and find

galaxy. We attempt several objective approaches : matching galaxy images to
``templates''; examinig the 180-degree Asymmetry against Light Concentration
(following Abraham et al. 1995); and exploring angle-dependent asymmetry
measures. While none of the quantities we use results in a clean distinction
between normal and peculiar galaxies, there is a rough correlation between some
parameters and image peculiarity. However, the mixing between the two classes
is significant. We conclude that the class of peculiar galaxies is not totally
distinct from the class of normal galaxies, and that what we are seeing is
really a sequence. It is therefore more useful to consider distribution
functions of morphological parameters. The current and possibly other, more
accurate parametrisations require better data, which is becoming available

77 stars, 66 stars have on average of 3-4 measurements with a total of 236
velocities. A typical velocity error per measurement is about 3 km/s. The stars
in our sample are spatially distributed from the cluster center out to 10
arcminutes in radius (4.5 core radii). Among these 66 stars with multiple
velocity measurements, we discovered 6 spectroscopic binary candidates. Of
these six candidates, one was discovered as a binary previously by Pryor et al.
(1991) and candidate ST is a binary with a very short-period of three to five
days. We obtained three possible orbital solutions for binary candidate ST by
fitting its radial velocity data. These orbital solutions are consistent with
star ST being a cluster member, although its spectrum has much stronger MgI
triplet absorption line than that of a typical low-metallicity giant star. We
estimated the fraction of binary systems which may have been missed from our
detection due to unfavorable binary orbital configurations. Our survey has a
binary discovery efficiency of 29% for systems with 3d < P < 10yr, 0.125 < q <
1.75 and eccentric orbits (0 < e < 1). This yields a binary frequency of 29%.
With Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests, the hypothesis of a frequency in NGC5053
higher than 50% is rejected with a confidence level higher than 85%. We
conclude that the binary frequency in NGC5053 is 21-29% with 3d < P < 10yr,
0.125 < q < 1.75. This value is somewhat higher than estimates for other
clusters by various surveys. This is perhaps related to the fact that NGC5053

regime for the dynamics of an infinite system. The second is an Intermediate
Regime that separates the Out of Equilibrium Regime from equilibrium. After
studying the crossover beetween the two regimes, we focus on the Out of
Equilibrium Regime and we reveal some of the geometrical features of phase
space. According to recent analitical work, we find that the asymptotic out of
equilibrium energy density is the equilibrium one. The same happens to the
staggered-magnetisation, suggesting there is a deep geometrical similarity
between equilibrium and out of equilibrium configurations. A procedure, that we

Hall effect system at exactly integer filling at finite temperatures and in the

off-diagonal conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ which is `anomalous' in nature as it
survives even in the zero impurity limit. The diagonal conductivity
$\sigma_{xx}$ survives only when both temperature and disorder is non zero. At
low temperatures, $\sigma_{xx}$ activates with a temperature dependent
prefactor. Inverting the conductivity matrix, we determine the resistivities.
The deviation of the off-diagonal resistivity $\rho_{xy}$ from its zero
temperature value and the diagonal resistivity $\rho_{xx}$ activate with a
temperature dependent prefactor at low temperatures, in agreement with
experiments. Further, we find two physical regimes both of which are at low
temperatures and low broadening, which provide the experimentally observed
linear relationship between the deviation of $\rho_{xy}$ and the $\rho_{xx}$
with different signs. We have also estimated the effective masses from the
experimental data of $\rho_{xy}$ and find them to be reasonable. Finally, our
result on compressibility as a function of temperature shows that there is no
phase transition involved in the system as far as the temperature is concerned.

electroweak scale which has significant theoretical advantages over both the
standard model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The theory
is supersymmetric at short distances but differs significantly from the MSSM.
Flavor symmetry violation is intimately related to supersymmetry breaking.
There is a new physics scale $\mt\sim$~5--20 TeV which sets the mass of the
first two sparticle families. Supersymmetric sources of CP violation and flavor
changing neutral currents for the first two families are suppressed. Effective
Supersymmetry can be implemented with automatic suppression of baryon and
lepton number violation and a dynamically generated $\mu$ term, while
maintaining naturalness in the Higgs sector. There are implications for new
particle searches, flavor and CP violation experiments, as well as for the
construction of theories of flavor and dynamical supersymmetry breaking.
