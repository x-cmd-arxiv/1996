nearby clusters of galaxies provides a powerful constraint on the history of
star formation in dense environments. However, with local data alone, it is not
possible to separate models where galaxies assembled synchronously over
redshifts 0<z<1 from ones where galaxies formed stochastically at much earlier
times. Here we attempt to resolve this ambiguity via high precision rest-frame
UV-optical photometry of a large sample of morphologically-selected spheroidal
galaxies in three z~0.54 clusters which have been observed with HST. We
demonstrate the robustness of using HST to conduct the morphological separation
of spheroidal and disk galaxies at this redshift and use our new data to repeat
the analysis conducted locally at a significant look-back time. We find a small
scatter (< 0.1 mag rms) for galaxies classed as Es and E/S0s, both internally
within each of the three clusters and externally from cluster to cluster. We do
not find any trend for the scatter to increase with decreasing luminosity down
to L = L*+3, other than can be accounted for by observational error. Neither is
there evidence for a distinction between the scatter observed for galaxies
classified as ellipticals and S0. Our result provides a new constraint on the
star formation history of cluster spheroidals prior to z=0.5 confirming and
considerably strengthening the earlier conclusions. Most of the star formation
in the elliptical galaxies in dense clusters was completed before z~3 in
conventional cosmologies. Although we cannot rule out the continued production
of some ellipticals, our results do indicate an era of initial star formation
consistent with the population of star-forming galaxies recently detected
beyond z~3.

relatively short (<600sec) RASS exposure times, only 10% of the QSOs are
detected in X-rays, so X-ray spectral model fits for individual QSOs are
precluded by poor photon statistics. Spectral stacking provides effectively
much more sensitive X-ray observations for an average QSO in bins of redshift,
and for several classes of QSOs. We model the stacked X-ray spectra in a way
that obviates both the distinction between detections and non-detections, and
the need to stack together only those objects observed through similar Galactic
column densities N_H. In application to the LBQS/RASS sample, we marginally
confirm a flattening of the X-ray spectral index of QSOs toward higher
redshifts. Radio-loud QSOs show flatter X-ray photon indices, in agreement with
previous work. We show that the apparent flattening of the photon index with
redshift is not due to an increasing fractional contribution from the
radio-loud class of QSOs.

neutron stars that hit an Earth-like planet closer than $\sim 1 kpc$ from the
explosion produce lethal fluxes of atmospheric muons at ground level,
underground and underwater. These CRBs also destroy the ozone layer and
radioactivate the environment. The mean rate of such life devastating CRBs is
one in 100 million years (Myr), consistent with the observed 5 ``great''
extinctions in the past 600 Myr. Unlike the previously suggested
extraterrestrial extinction mechanisms the CRBs explain massive life extinction
on the ground, underground and underwater and the higher survival levels of
radiation resistant species and of terrain sheltered species. More distant
mergers can cause smaller extinctions. Biological mutations caused by ionizing
radiation produced by the CRB may explain a fast appearance of new species
after mass extinctions. The CRB extinction predicts detectable enrichment of
rock layers which formed during the extinction periods with cosmogenically
produced radioactive nucleides such as $^{129}$I, $^{146}$Sm, $^{205}$Pb with
and $^{244}$Pu. Tracks of high energy particles in rock layers on Earth and on
the moon may also contain records of intense CRBs. An early warning of future
extinctions due to neutron star mergers can be obtained by identifying, mapping
and timing all the nearby binary neutron stars systems. A final warning of an
approaching CRB from a nearby neutron stars merger will be provided by a gamma

correlations with N-body simulations for various power spectra (Buchert etal
1994, Melott etal 1995, Weiss etal 1996). Thereby, spatial optimization
techniques were applied by (high-frequency-)filtering of the initial power
spectra. In this work the novel method of temporal optimization [Shifted-Time-
Approximation (STA) and Frozen-Time-Approximation (FTA)] is investigated and
used. The method is designed to compensate the native property of Lagrangian
perturbation solutions to delay the collapse of structures. The method can be
treated analytically. Applying the STA and FTA prescriptions a significant
improvement of the performance of Lagrangian perturbation schemes (as measured
by cross-correlation statistics) is observed. Using this tool we investigate a
local study of special clustering models of dark matter as candidates for
typical elements of the large-scale structure in the Universe, and so also
focus on the performance of the perturbation solutions on smaller scales at
high-spatial resolution. The models analyzed were presented in (Buchert etal
1996) and allow studying typical features of the clustering process in the
weakly non-linear regime. The spatial and temporal limits of applicability of
the solutions at second and third order are determined and compared with the
first-order solution, which is equivalent to the ``Zel'dovich approximation''

agglutinative languages with productive inflectional and derivational

automatic morphological disambiguation involves selecting for each token
morphological parse(s), with the right set of inflectional and derivational
markers. Our system combines corpus independent hand-crafted constraint rules,
constraint rules that are learned via unsupervised learning from a training
corpus, and additional statistical information obtained from the corpus to be
morphologically disambiguated. The hand-crafted rules are linguistically
motivated and tuned to improve precision without sacrificing recall. In certain
respects, our approach has been motivated by Brill's recent work, but with the
observation that his transformational approach is not directly applicable to
languages like Turkish. Our approach also uses a novel approach to unknown word
processing by employing a secondary morphological processor which recovers any
relevant inflectional and derivational information from a lexical item whose
root is unknown. With this approach, well below 1% of the tokens remains as
unknown in the texts we have experimented with. Our results indicate that by
combining these hand-crafted, statistical and learned information sources, we
can attain a recall of 96 to 97% with a corresponding precision of 93 to 94%,
and ambiguity of 1.02 to 1.03 parses per token.

positions with higher symmetry, such as triangular symmetry, it is shown here
that the non-Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures can be generic. Using
various bosonization techniques, the fixed point is shown to be {\em stable}.
However, unlike the conventional two-channel Kondo (2CK) model, it has {\em
four} leading irrelevant operators, implying that while the form of the
singular temperature dependence of physical quantities is similar to the 2CK
model, there will not be simple universal amplitude ratios. The phase diagram

this probability law is initially defined by a statistical field theory in the
basin of attraction of a renormalisation fixed point, we show that its time
evolution is obtained by averaging over small scale features of the velocity
potential. The probability law of the velocity potential converges to the fixed
point in the long time regime. At the fixed point, the scaling dimension of the
velocity potential is determined to be ${-{4\over 3}}$. We give conditions for
the existence of such a fixed point of the renormalisation group describing the

response estimates which suggest that particle flux would be much higher along
steps than across terraces on a clean aluminum surface, we study step
nucleation in the presence of a small driving force along a surface. We find
that step nucleation, even on a nearly defect-free void surface, would be slow
if the step energy is equal to that calculated for a clean aluminum surface. In
the presence of a uniform electromigration force, the creation of new steps
between existing ones should not occur unless the free energy cost of a step is
much less than thermal energies. We conclude that voids cannot move
intragranularly at $\mu$m/hr rates without help from other factors such as
local heating and impurities.
