leads to higher neutrino cross sections for the processes nu_mu + N --> mu + X
needed to calculate the expected rates of astrophysical neutrino induced muons
in large detectors either under construction, or in the design stage. These
higher cross sections lead to higher muon rates for arrival angles where
neutrino attenuation in the earth is less important. On the other hand, new
estimates of AGN neutrino fluxes suggest that the expected muon rates in these
detectors may be much lower than previously calculated. I use the new cross
sections to calculate the expected muon rates and angular distributions in
large detectors for a variety of AGN models and compare these rates with the
atmospheric neutrino backrounds (from both conventional decay channels and the
""prompt"" charmed meson decay channels). If the lowest flux estimates are
correct, there may be diffculties in determining the origin of a small excess
of muons, due to the large uncertainty in the rate of the charmed meson
neutrino production channel. However, the more optimistic AGN neutrino fluxes
should be detectable in proposed detectors, such as DUMAND-II, AMANDA, NESTOR
and Lake Baikal.

initial magnetic field during the pregalactic era, when galaxies are first
forming. Their development proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, weak
magnetic fields are created by the Biermann battery mechanism, acting in
shocked parts of the intergalactic medium where caustics form and intersect. In
the second phase, these weak magnetic fields are amplified to strong magnetic
fields by the Kolmogoroff turbulence endemic to gravitational structure
formation of galaxies. During this second phase, the magnetic fields reach
saturation with the turbulent power, but they are coherent only on the scale of
the smallest eddy. In the third phase, the magnetic field strength increases to
equipartition with the turbulent energy, and the coherence length of the
magnetic fields increases to the scale of the largest turbulent eddy,
comparable to the scale of the entire galaxy. The resulting magnetic field
represents a galactic magnetic field of primordial origin. No further dynamo
action is necessary, after the galaxy forms, to explain the origin of magnetic
fields. However, the magnetic field may be altered by dynamo action once the
galaxy and the galactic disk have formed. It is first shown by direct numerical
simulations, that thermoelectric currentsassociated with the Biermann battery,
build the field up from zero to $10^{-21}$ G in the regions about to collapse
into galaxies, by $z\sim3$. For weak fields, in the absence of dissipation, the

quenched disorder described by the so-called generalized Ashkin-Teller model
(GATM) is studied. In the critical region this model is shown to be described
by a multifermion field theory similar to the Gross-Neveu model with a few
independent quartic coupling constants. Renormalization group calculations are
used to obtain the temperature dependence near the critical point of some
thermodynamic quantities and the large distance behavior of the two-spin
correlation function. The equation of state at criticality is also obtained in
this framework. We find that random models described by the GATM belong to the
same universality class as that of the two-dimensional Ising model. The
critical exponent $\nu$ of the correlation length for the 3- and 4-state
random-bond Potts models is also calculated in a 3-loop approximation. We show
that this exponent is given by an apparently convergent series in
$\epsilon=c-\frac{1}{2}$ (with $c$ the central charge of the Potts model) and
that the numerical values of $\nu$ are very close to that of the 2D Ising
model. This work therefore supports the conjecture (valid only approximately
for the 3- and 4-state Potts models) of a superuniversality for the 2D
disordered models with discrete symmetries.

handling this situation is to employ the theory of varying sets (presheafs) on
the space $\B$ of all Boolean subalgebras of the orthoalgebra $\UP$ of history
propositions. This approach automatically includes the feature whereby
probabilistic predictions are meaningful only in the context of a consistent
set of history propositions. More strikingly, it leads to a picture in which
the `truth values', or `semantic values' of such contextual predictions are not
just two-valued (\ie true and false) but instead lie in a larger logical

its partner plus a Goldstino, $G$. For a supersymmetry breaking scale below a

distinctive signatures. If a neutralino is the lightest standard model
superpartner it decays by $\chi_1^0 \to \gamma + G$, and if kinematically
accessible by $\chi_1^0 \to (Z^0, h^0, H^0, A^0) + G$. These decays can give
rise to displaced vertices. Alternately, if a slepton is the lightest standard
model superpartner it decays by $\tilde{l} \to l + G$. This can be seen as a
greater than minimum ionizing charged particle track, possibly with a kink to a
