are independent of metallicity (Freedman, et al., 1996, Saha et al., 1996,
Tanvir et al., 1995). The three groups obtain different vales for H_0. We note
that most of this discrepancy stems from the asumption (by both groups) that
the Period-Luminosity relation is independent of metallicity. We come to this
conclusion as a result of our study of the Period-Luminosity relation of 481
Cepheids with 3 millions two colour measurements in the Large Magellanic Cloud

is applied to recent estimates based on HST Cepheids observations it makes the
low-H_0 values higher and the high-H_0 value lower, bringing those discrepant
estimates into agrement around $H_0 \approx 70 km/s Mpc^{-1}$.

Cepheids in samples of different metallicity. It is based on 481 Cepheids in
the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds from the blue and red filter CCD
observations (most similar to V_J & R_J) of the French EROS microlensing
project. The data-set is complete and provides an excellent basis for a
differential analysis between LMC and SMC. In comparison to previous studies of
effects on the PL-relation, the EROS data-set offers extremely well-sampled
light curves and well-filled instability strips. This allows reliable
separation of Cepheids pulsating in the fundamental and the first overtone mode
and derivation of differential reddening. Our main result concerns the
determination of distances to galaxies which are inferred by using the LMC as a
base and using two color photometry to establish the amount of reddening. We
find a zero-point offset between SMC and LMC which amounts to a difference
between inferred and true distance modulus of 0.14 \pm 0.06 mag in the VI_c
system. The offset is exactly the same in both sets of PL-relations - of the
fundamental and of the first overtone mode Cepheids. No effect is seen on the
slopes of the PL-relations, although the fundamental and the first overtone
mode Cepheids have different PL slopes. We attribute the color and the
zero-point offset to the difference in metallicity between the SMC and LMC
Cepheids. A metallicity effect of that small magnitude still has important
consequencies for the inferred Cepheid distances and the determination of H_0.
When applied to recent estimates based on HST Cepheid observations, our
metallicity dependence makes the low-H_0 values (Sandage et al. 1994) higher

decrease of carrier concentration as the pressure increases is explained
through the existence of a subsidiary minimum in the conduction band. This
minimum shifts towards lower energies under pressure, with a pressure
coefficient of about -105 meV/GPa, and its related impurity level traps
electrons as it reaches the band gap and approaches the Fermi level. The
pressure value at which the electron trapping starts is shown to depend on the
electron concentration at ambient pressure and the dimensionality of the
electron gas. At low pressures the electron mobility increases under pressure
for both 3D and 2D electrons, the increase rate being higher for 2D electrons,
which is shown to be coherent with previous scattering mechanisms models. The
phase transition from the semiconductor layered phase to the metallic sodium
cloride phase is observed as a drop in resistivity around 105 kbar, but above

observed, which is attributed to the formation of donor defects as precursors
of the phase transition.

temperature phase of the electroweak standard theory is a strongly coupled
SU(2)-Higgs-model in three dimensions. We outline in detail a model in which
the spatial correlation scales in this phase are calculated as inverse
relativistic bound state masses. Selection rules for these states are derived.
The correlation masses are calculated by evaluating the bound state Green's
function. The scalar-scalar-potential and its influence on the masses is
investigated. The predictions for the correlation masses agree very well with
the lattice data available now.

wavefunctions. We find that the knockout mechanisms are comparable to the
diffractive production of vector-meson-dominance model when only (3-5)% strange
quark admixture is assumed, which should be compared with (10-20)% of the
nonrelativistic quark model prediction. The cross sections of the $uud$- and

experimentally. We also briefly discuss a way to determine the strangeness

The central depression of the proton point density seen in modern four-body
calculations is too small by itself to lead to a correct description of the
charge distribution. We utilize six-quark structures calculated in the
Chromodielectric Model for N-N interactions, and we find a swelling of the
proton charge distribution as the internucleon distance decreases. These charge
distributions are combined with the $^4$He wave function using the Independent
Pair Approximation and two-body distributions generated from Green's Function
Monte Carlo calculations. We obtain a reasonably good fit to the experimental
charge distribution without including meson exchange currents.
