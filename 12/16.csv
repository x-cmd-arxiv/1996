universe. At present the most plausible theory of the origin of the universe is
that it formed from the explosion of an extremely hot and dense fireball
several billion years ago. During the first few seconds after the big bang, the
energy density was so great that only fundamental particles (leptons, quarks,
gauge bosons) existed. As the universe cooled and expanded after the big bang,
nuclei and atoms formed and condensed into galaxies and stars and systems of
them. The fundamental particles and a wide range of gravitational aggregates of
them constitute the small-scale and large-scale structure of the present
universe. The current knowledge of the elements of the structure of the
universe based on the standard big bang model and the standard model of
fundamental particles is considered.

late-type stars and hot white dwarfs that are near enough to escape absorption
by interstellar gas. However, about 15% of EUV sources are as of yet
unidentified with any optical counterparts. We examine whether the unidentified
EUV sources may consist of the same population of late-type stars and white
dwarfs. We present B and R photometry of stars in the fields of seven of the
unidentified EUV sources. We detect in the optical the entire main-sequence and
white-dwarf population out to the greatest distances where they could still
avoid absorption. We use colour-magnitude diagrams to demonstrate that, in most
of the fields, none of the observed stars have the colours and magnitudes of
late-type dwarfs at distances less than 100 pc. Similarly, none are white
dwarfs within 500 pc that are hot enough to be EUV-emitters. The unidentified
EUV sources we study are not detected in X-rays, while cataclysmic variables,
X-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei generally are. We conclude that some
of the EUV sources may be a new class of nearby objects, that are either very
faint at optical bands or which mimic the colours and magnitudes of distant
late-type stars or cool white dwarfs. One candidate for optically faint objects
is isolated old neutron stars, slowly accreting interstellar matter. Such
neutron stars are expected to be abundant in the Galaxy, and have not been
unambiguously detected.

  MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/290.2.292",,"astro-ph",,"  In this paper we present weak lensing observations of the fields around 8 z~1
luminous radio sources. These data are searched for the lensing signatures of
clusters that are either physically associated with the radio objects, or are
foreground systems projected along the line of sight. The radio sources were
all imaged with WFPC-2/HST providing high quality shape information on large
numbers of faint galaxies around them. Statistical analysis of the coherent
shear field visible in the shapes of the faint galaxies indicates that we have
detected a weak lensing signal close to one of the targets, 3C336 at z=0.927,
with a high level of confidence. A second, independent WFPC-2 observation of
this target reinforces this detection. Our results support the earlier
suggestion of weak lensing in this field by Fort et al (1996) using
ground-based data. We also combined the shear distributions in the remaining 7
field to improve our sensitivity to weak shear signals from any structure
typically associated with these sources. We find no detectable signal and
estimate an upper limit on the maximum shear allowed by our observations. Using
an N(z) estimated from lensing analyses we convert our observed lensing signal
and limits into estimates of the masses of the various structures. We suggest
that further lensing observations of distant radio sources and their host
environments may allow the cluster L_X-mass relationship to be mapped at
high-z. This is crucial for interpreting the results of the next generation of
deep X-ray surveys, and thus constraining the redshift evolution of the cluster
mass function out to z=1.

well-defined 8-arcmin ring of UV-bright stars surrounded by a larger H-alpha
ring, suggesting sequential star formation.
  FUV PSF photometry is obtained for 11,306 stars, and a FUV luminosity
function is derived. A (FUV-V,V) color-magnitude diagram for 195 identified
supergiants, with derived extinctions; the bluest (least-reddened) stars of
each spectral type have FUV-V colors consistent with models. FUV photometry is

total emission within the apertures defined by Kennicutt & Hodge. The
flux-weighted average ratio of total to stellar FUV flux is 2.15; the stellar
FUV luminosity function indicates that most of the excess total flux is due to
scattered FUV radiation, rather than faint stars. Both stellar and total
emission are well correlated with H-alpha fluxes, and yield FUV/H-alpha ratios
that are consistent with models of single-burst clusters with SMC metallicity,
ages from 1-5 Myr, and moderate (E(B-V)=0.0-0.1 mag) internal SMC extinction.

repulsion induces in the chains an order parameter with opposite sign. Due to
the anticrossing produced by hybridization between planes and chains, one
obtains a d-wave like order parameter which changes sign on a single sheet of
the Fermi surface and has nodes in the gap. We find that our model accounts
quite well for the anisotropy of the penetration depth and for the absolute
values. We reproduce fairly well the whole temperature dependence for both the

use a set of parameters which are all quite reasonable physically. Our results

at centre-of-mass energies typical of LEP2 and somewhat larger. The theoretical
framework considered is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. The interest
in exploiting the $e^+e^-$ CERN collider at values of $\sqrt s$ greater than
192 GeV could come from the discovery of Supersymmetric signals during runs at
lower energy. If these indicate that a charged Higgs boson exists in the mass
range $\MH\approx95-105$ GeV, then a few years of running at $\sqrt s=205-215$
GeV and nominal luminosity could make the detection of such scalars feasible,
in the purely leptonic channel $\tau\nu_\tau\tau\nu_\tau$ and, for small
$\tb$'s, also in the semi-hadronic(leptonic) one ${jj}\tau\nu_\tau$. Charged
Higgs bosons of the above nature cannot be produced by the beam energies
approved at present for LEP2. However, if runs beyond the so-called `192 GeV
cryogenic limit' will be approved by the CERN Council, our selection procedure
will enable us to establish the presence, or otherwise, of charged Higgs bosons
in the mentioned mass range

existence of soliton stabilizing mechanisms will further prolong or prevent
this process.

Hamiltonian in Type I' theory. This Hamiltonian includes couplings between the
zero branes and background Dirichlet 8 branes localized at the orientifold
planes. We identify states, localized at the orientifold planes, with the
requisite gauge boson quantum numbers. An interesting feature is that $E_8$
gauge symmetry relates bound states of different numbers of zero branes.

between QED and QCD. In this paper, we discuss the similarities that may
survive in a non-perturbative QCD calculation in the context of a precision
non-perturbative QED calculation. Central to the discussion are how a
constituent picture arises in a gauge field theory, how bound-state energy
scales emerge to guide the renormalization procedure, and how rotational
invariance emerges in a light-front calculation.

of a wave in a 12-dimensional theory. The instanton charge is thus related to a
linear momentum in 12 dimensions. This suggests that the instanton should play
as important role in type IIB theory as the 0-brane is supposed to play in type

exchange, but neglect the interference between the amplitudes. In case of pion
exchange the antikaon production cross section can be expressed in terms of the
antikaon production cross section from a pion-nucleon interaction, which we
take from the experimental data if available. Otherwise, a $K^*$-resonance
exchange model is introduced to relate the different reaction cross sections.
In case of kaon exchange the antikaon production cross section is related to
the elastic $KN$ and $\bar KN$ cross sections, which are again taken from
experimental measurements. We find that the one-meson exchange model gives a
satisfactory fit to the available data for the $NN\to NNK\bar K$ cross section
at high energies. We compare our predictions for the cross section near
threshold with an earlier empirical parameterization and that from phase space
models.
