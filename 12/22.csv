about $10^{15}$ eV are fairly well explained by models involving supernova
shocks. In contrast, no widely accepted theory exists for the origin of
ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), which have energies above $10^{15}$ eV.
Instead of proposing a specific model, here we place strong constraints on any
model of UHECRs involving isolated neutron stars (no companions). We consider
the total power requirements and show that the only viable power source
associated with isolated neutron stars is rotation. Mechanisms based on
accretion from the interstellar medium fall short of the necessary power
despite the most optimistic assumptions. Power considerations also demonstrate
that not enough rotational energy is tapped by a ""propeller""-like acceleration
of interstellar matter. The most promising source of energy is rotational
spindown via magnetic braking. We examine microphysical energy loss processes
near magnetized neutron stars and conclude that the most likely site for
yielding UHECRs from isolated neutron stars is near or beyond the light
cylinder.

of active galactic nuclei in which the variability arises as a result of
photon-photon pair production interactions with X-rays emitted by a hot spot in
the inner part of the accretion disk. As the hot spot orbits around the central
engine, the amount of absorption varies periodically. Our model may account for
the observed variability of TeV emission from Markarian 421 and other blazars
detected by the EGRET instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, as well
as correlated variations of X-ray and TeV gamma flux from Markarian 421.
Quasi-periodic variations observed in Markarian 421 enable us to place an upper
limit on the black hole mass of (2-30) times 10^8 solar masses.

origin of the highest energy cosmic rays is still uncertain, it is not
necessary to invoke exotic models such as emission by topological defects to
explain the existing data. It seems likely that shock acceleration at
Fanaroff-Riley Class II radio galaxies can account for the existing data.
However, new cosmic ray data, as well as better estimates of the extragalactic
radiation fields and magnetic fields will be necessary before we will be
certain of the origin of the highest energy particles occurring in nature.

  Wefel (World Scientific, Singapore), in press",,,"ADP-AT-96-15","astro-ph",,"  I give a brief critical review of the predicted intensity of diffuse high
energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin over the energy range from 10^12 eV to
10^24 eV. Neutrinos from interactions of galactic cosmic rays with interstellar
matter are guaranteed, and the intensity can be reliably predicted to within a
factor of about 2 up to 10^17 eV. Somewhat less certain are intensities in the
same energy range from cosmic rays escaping from normal galaxies or active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and interacting with intracluster gas. At higher
energies, neutrinos will be produced by interactions of extragalactic cosmic
rays with the microwave background. Other sources, such as AGN, in particular
blazars, and topological defects, are more speculative. However, searches for
neutrinos from all of these potential sources should be made because their
observation would have important implications for high energy astrophysics and
cosmology.

To appear in Physical Review D","Phys.Rev.D55:1948-1963,1997","10.1103/PhysRevD.55.1948",,"gr-qc",,"  We attempt to find a function that characterizes gravitational clumping and
that increases monotonically as inhomogeneity increases. We choose $S =
ln\Omega$ as the candidate ``gravitational entropy'' function, where $\Omega$
is the phase-space volume below the Hamiltonian H of the system under
consideration. We compute $\Omega$ for transverse electromagnetic waves and for
gravitational wave, radiation and density perturbations in an expanding FLRW
universe. These calculations are carried out in the linear regime under the
assumption that the phases of the oscillators comprising the system are random.
Entropy is thus attributed to the lack of knowledge of the exact field
configuration. We find that $\Omega$, and hence $ln\Omega$ behaves as required.
We also carry out calculations for Bianchi IX cosmological models and find
that, even in this homogeneous case, the function can be interpreted sensibly.
We compare our results with Penrose's C^2 hypothesis. Because S is defined to
resemble the fundamental statistical mechanics definition of entropy, we are
able to recover the entropy in a variety of familiar circumstances including,
evidently, black-hole entropy. The results point to the utility of the
relativistic ADM Hamiltonian formalism in establishing a connection between
general relativity and statistical mechanics, although fully nonlinear
calculations will need to be performed to remove any doubt.

in light of a possible width difference $\Delta\Gamma_s$, charged B decays, and
SU(3) relations among certain transition amplitudes. In order to describe the
relevant non-leptonic B decays, low energy effective Hamiltonians calculated
beyond the leading logarithmic approximation are used. Special emphasis is
given to the role of electroweak penguin operators in such transitions. These
effects are analyzed both within a general framework and more specifically in
view of the theoretical cleanliness of methods to determine CKM phases.
Strategies for obtaining insights into the world of electroweak penguins are
discussed.
