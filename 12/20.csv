  by N. Soker, (San Francisco: Publ. Astr. Soc. Pacific), in press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Central cluster galaxies in cooling flows show the signatures of gaseous
accretion and ongoing star formation at rates ranging between 1-100 solar
masses per year. Their blue morphologies usually reflect the low net angular
momentum content of the less than 10,000 K gas from which the accretion
population formed, and the effects of interactions between the cool gas and
their FR I radio sources. For example, there is strong evidence that star
formation is being triggered, in part, by interactions between the 10,000 K gas
and the radio sources in some objects. Disk star formation on kiloparsec scales
is rare in cooling flows. The optically determined star formation rates,
assuming the Local initial mass function (IMF), are typically factors of 10-100
smaller than the cooling rates determined from X-ray observations, and
signatures of the remaining material have not been identified outside of the
X-ray band. The IMF is poorly understood in cooling flows; most of the cooling
material may be deposited in low-mass stars or some other form of dark matter.
Continued study of the interactions between radio sources and the intercluster
medium will further our understanding of how elliptical galaxies, particularly
radio ellipticals in the early universe, evolve.

grain spins down and goes through a ``crossover''. As first pointed out by
Spitzer & McGlynn (1979), the grain angular momentum before and after a
crossover event are correlated, and the degree of this correlation affects the
alignment of dust grains by paramagnetic dissipation. We calculate the
correlation including the important effects of thermal fluctuations within the
grain material. These fluctuations limit the degree to which the grain angular
momentum J is coupled with the grain principal axis a_1 of maximal inertia. We
show that this imperfect coupling of a_1 with J plays a critical role during
crossovers and can substantially increase the efficiency of paramagnetic
alignment for grains larger than 10^{-5} cm. As a result, we show that for
reasonable choices of parameters, the observed alignment of $a\gtrsim 10^{-5}$
cm grains could be produced by paramagnetic dissipation in suprathermally
rotating grains, if radiative torques due to starlight were not present. We
also show that the efficiency of mechanical alignment in the limit of long
alignment times is not altered by the thermal fluctuations in the grain
material.

mJy, in agreement with the results from previous surveys. The 2.4 GHz counts,
which are the deepest at this or similar frequencies (e.g. 2.7 GHz), agree well

median spectral index for the 1.4 GHz sample remains constant at about 0.8,
down to the lowest fluxes (S(1.4)=0.2 mJy), while for the higher frequency
sample the spectral index distribution flattens in the lower flux density

strongly depend on whether they are treated as single systems or as sums of

saturates to a universal value $G={\frac{2\nu}{\nu+1}} {\frac{e^2}{h}}$. We use
this result to show that devices with different types of contacts between the

conductance which are rational multiples of $e^2/h$. The particular fraction
$e^2/h$ is obtained for the case of electron tunneling in and out of a FQH
liquid by two point contacts. We demonstrate that the problem of tunneling
between an electron gas and a fractional quantum Hall state through an impurity
is exactly equivalent to the problem of tunneling between a chiral Fermi liquid
and a chiral Luttinger liquid. We investigate in detail the case of tunneling
to a $\nu=1/3$ FQH state which we show to be equivalent to the problem of

experimental realization of this important exactly solvable case. We use the

centers coupled independently to an electron reservoir, which is relevant to
recent experiments by A.~Chang et.~al. We derive an explicit universal

system smoothly crosses over from BCS-pairs to compact Boson picture of
superconductivity. As pairing strength grows and pairs become compact
significant deviations from universal Abrikosov-Gorkov dependence of T_{c} on
disorder appear in case of d-wave pairing with superconducting state becoming

When the coupling to the leads increases and Coulomb blockade effects can be

$B$ mesons decay much more copiously to final states with no open charm than
currently assumed, or $B(D^0 \to K^-\pi^+)$ has to be reduced significantly.
This note takes the experimental $B(D^0 \to K^-\pi^+)$ at its face value and
estimates $B(b\to$ no open charm) using complementary methods: one accounts for
the $c$ quark in $b\to c$ transitions, the other accounts for the $\bar c$
quark in $b\to c\bar c s$ transitions. Through cancellation of errors, the
average gives our best estimate of $B(b\to$ no open charm), and the difference
measures the consistency. The results of the methods are consistent with each
other, strongly suggesting a much enhanced $B(b\to$ no open charm). This
observation indicates that non-perturbative QCD effects are probably causing a
sizable fraction of the $b\to c\bar cs$ transitions to be seen as charmless
$b\to s$ processes, contrary to smaller traditional expectations. This
mechanism has generally been overlooked and may explain the existing
experimental data within the framework of the standard model. We then briefly
discuss implications on baryon production governed by $b\to c\bar cs$
processes, rare hadronic $B$ decays and CP violation studies.

theoretical and mathematical physics equations. The application of this
algorithm to the free Schrodinger equation permited us to establish that in
addition to the known Galilei symmetry, the free Schrodinger equation possesses
also the relativistic symmetry in some generalized sense. This property of the
free Schrodinger equation permits the equation to be extended into the
relativistic area of movements of a particle being studied.

shown that such a lattice is characterized by a system of integrable discrete
nonlinear equations. Different useful formulations of the system are given. The
geometric construction of the lattice is also discussed and, in particular, it
is clarified the number of initial--boundary data which define the lattice
uniquely.

quantum S=1/2 chain with variable range exchange of the form $h(j-k)\propto
\sinh^{-2}a(j-k)$. It is found that usual bound state appears for some values
of the total pseudomomentum of two magnons as for the Heisenberg chain with
nearest-neighbor spin interaction. Besides this state, a new type of bound
state with oscillating wave function appears at larger values of the total
pseudomomentum.
