projective plane and the blown-up projective plane. These moduli spaces are
identified with various instanton moduli spaces on the 4-sphere and $\cpbar $,

accounts for the systematics of galaxy rotation curves and cluster dynamics
without invoking dark matter, the idea remains a largely ad hoc modification of
Newtonian dynamics with no basis in deeper theory. Non-standard scalar-tensor
theories have been suggested as a theoretical basis for MOND; however, any such
theory with the usual conformal relation between the Einstein and physical
metrics fails to predict the degree of light deflection observed in distant
clusters of galaxies. In the present paper, I demonstrate that one can write
down a framework for scalar-tensor theories which predict the MOND
phenomenology for the low velocity (v<<c) dynamics of galaxies and clusters of
galaxies and which are consistent with observations of extragalactic
gravitational lenses provided that one drops the requirement of the Lorentz
Invariance of gravitational dynamics. This leads to ``preferred frame''
theories characterized by a non-conformal relation between the two metrics. I
describe a toy theory in which the local environment (the solar system, binary
pulsars) is protected from detectable preferred frame effects by the very same
non-standard (aquadratic) scalar Lagrangian which gives rise to the MOND
phenomenology. Although this particular theory is also contrived, it represents
a limiting case for two-field theories of MOND, and is consistent with a wide
range of gravitational phenomena.

$B^2/8\pi$. However, their conclusion that weak interaction rates increased
with increasing B-field at these low field values contradicted the earlier

of the weak interaction rate about B=0 used in COST is not well-defined, while
the Euler-McLaurin expansion of KSV is well-behaved and reliable. Using the

underlying power law, a Compton-reflection component with an Fe K-alpha line,
low-energy absorption by intervening cold matter, and a high-energy cutoff
above ~ 200 keV. The X-ray energy spectral index, alpha, is typically in the
range ~ 0.8-1 in Seyfert spectra from Ginga, EXOSAT and OSSE. The hard-state
spectra of black-hole candidates Cyg X-1 and GX 339-4 from simultaneous
Ginga/OSSE observations have alpha ~ 0.6-0.8. The Compton-reflection component
corresponds to cold matter (e.g., inner or outer parts of an accretion disk)
covering a solid angle of ~ (0.4-1) times 2 pi as seen from the X-ray source.
The spectra are cut off in soft gamma-rays above ~ 200 keV. The broad-band
spectra of both Seyferts and black-hole sources are well fitted by Compton
upscattering of soft photons in thermal plasmas. Our fits yield the thermal
plasma temperature of ~ 100 keV and the Thomson optical depth of tau 1. A
fraction of the luminosity emitted nonthermally appears to be small and it can
be constrained to < 15% in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. The spectra are cut off
before 511 keV, which is strongly suggestive of a thermostatic role of e+e-
pair production in constraining the temperature and optical depth of the
sources. The source geometry is compatible with a patchy corona above a cold
disk in Seyferts, but not in Cyg X-1. In the latter, the relative weakness of
reflection is compatible with reflection of emission of a hot inner disk from

solar mass precollapse model, which is representative of the class of stars
with compact iron cores. This model is evolved through core collapse and bounce
in one dimension using multigroup (neutrino-energy--dependent) flux-limited
diffusion (MGFLD) neutrino transport and Lagrangian hydrodynamics, providing
realistic initial conditions for the postbounce convection and evolution. Our
two-dimensional simulation begins at 106 ms after bounce at a time when there
is a well-developed gain region, and proceeds for 400 ms. We couple
two-dimensional (PPM) hydrodynamics to one-dimensional MGFLD neutrino
transport. At 225 ms after bounce we see large-scale convection behind the
shock, characterized by high-entropy, mushroom-like, expanding upflows and
dense, low-entropy, finger-like downflows. The upflows reach the shock and
distort it from sphericity. The radial convection velocities become supersonic
just below the shock, reaching magnitudes in excess of 10^9 cm/sec. Eventually,
however, the shock recedes to smaller radii, and at about 500 ms after bounce
there is no evidence in our simulation of an explosion or of a developing
explosion. Failure in our ``optimistic'' 15 solar mass Newtonian model leads us
to conclude that it is unlikely, at least in our approximation, that
neutrino-driven convection will lead to explosions for more massive stars with
fatter iron cores or in cases in which general relativity is included.

halos, the galaxy luminosity function, the Tully-Fisher relation, the
colour-magnitude relation for ellipticals, the gross morphological properties
of galaxies and the counts of faint galaxies as a function of magnitude,
redshift and morphology. Many of these properties can be explained, at least at
some level, within a broad class of CDM cosmologies, but a number of
fundamental issues remain unresolved. We use our semi-analytic model of galaxy
formation to interpret the evolutionary status of the Lyman-break galaxies at
$z\simeq 3-3.5$ recently discovered by Steidel et al. The abundance and global
properties of these objects are compatible with model predictions in a variety
of CDM cosmologies, including the standard version. All these models predict
mild evolution in the distribution of star formation rates which peaks at
around $z\simeq 1$, but is never much larger than it is at present. The Steidel
et al. Lyman-break galaxies are among the very first objects in which
appreciable star formation is taking place; they thus signal the onset of
galaxy formation. We present three example evolutionary histories of
Lyman-break galaxies which illustrate that these objects are the precursors of
present day, normal, bright ellipticals and spirals.

glass, no order parameter, such as the Parisi overlap distribution, can be both
translation-invariant and non-self-averaging. The standard mean-field picture
of the EA spin glass phase can therefore not be valid in any dimension and at
any temperature. Further analysis shows that, in general, when systems have
many competing (pure) thermodynamic states, a single state which is a mixture
of many of them (as in the standard mean-field picture) contains insufficient
information to reveal the full thermodynamic structure. We propose a different
approach, in which an appropriate thermodynamic description of such a system is
instead based on a metastate, which is an ensemble of (possibly mixed)
thermodynamic states. This approach, modelled on chaotic dynamical systems, is
needed when chaotic size dependence (of finite volume correlations) is present.
Here replicas arise in a natural way, when a metastate is specified by its
(meta)correlations. The metastate approach explains, connects, and unifies such
concepts as replica symmetry breaking, chaotic size dependence and replica
non-independence. Furthermore, it replaces the older idea of non-self-averaging
as dependence on the bulk couplings with the concept of dependence on the state
within the metastate at fixed coupling realization. We use these ideas to
classify possible metastates for the EA model, and discuss two scenarios
introduced by us earlier --- a nonstandard mean-field picture and a picture
intermediate between that and the usual scaling/droplet picture.

= 1/2$). The crossover time is estimated as $t_x \approx 16 hours$. We
interpret these results in terms of a global second order rate equation
indicating that (a) hydrates catalyse the hydration process for $t<t_x$, (b)
they inhibit further hydration for $t > t_x$ and (c) the value of the
associated second order rate constant is of magnitude 6x10^{-7} - 7x10^{-6}

being furnished as a diffusion limited precipitation that the exponents $\psi =

of cellular hydrate microstructures for this class of materials.

if $n\equiv 0\quad \pmod {G(d,k)}$. Furthermore, a formula for $G(d,k)$ is
given, showing that e.g. $G(d,k)=1$ if $k\ge
\left\lfloor\frac{d+1}{2}\right\rfloor$ or if both $d$ and $k$ are even, and
also in some other cases (meaning that all numbers beyond $N(d,k)$ occur as the
number of $k$-faces of some simple $d$-polytope).
  This question has previously been studied only for the case of vertices
($k=0$), where Lee \cite{Le} proved the existence of $N(d,0)$ (with $G(d,0)=1$
or $2$ depending on whether $d$ is even or odd), and Prabhu \cite{P2} showed
that $N(d,0) \le cd\sqrt {d}$. We show here that asymptotically the true value
of Prabhu's constant is $c=\sqrt2$ if $d$ is even, and $c=1$ if $d$ is odd.

the emitted particles is strongly reduced by experimental acceptance or
kinematic analysis selections. It is inconsistent with general principles
according to which the Bose-Einstein correlator is larger than unity. This
inconsistency seems to be rooted in the fact that quantum mechanical
localization properties are not taken into account properly.

decay of the resonances outside and inside the target nucleus. The latter
components are strongly distorted by the nuclear medium due to
resonance-nucleon scattering and a possible mass shift at finite baryon
density. These medium modifications are compared to background sources in the
dilepton spectrum from $\pi N$ bremsstrahlung and the Dalitz decays of
$\Delta$'s and $\eta$ mesons produced in the reaction.

dynamics of extended patterns. We show how the combined effect of an
instability to curvature modulations and proximity to a pitchfork front
bifurcation leads to spontaneous nucleation of spiral waves along the front.
This effect is demonstrated by direct simulations of a FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN)
model and by simulations of order parameter equations for the front velocity
and curvature. Spontaneous spiral-wave nucleation often results in a state of
spatio-temporal disorder involving repeated events of spiral wave nucleation,
domain spliting and spiral wave annihilation.

for locally convex algebras and Hopf algebras. Essentially we regard converging
power series expansion of a deformed product on a locally convex algebra, thus
giving the means to actually insert complex values for the deformation
parameter. Moreover we establish a topological duality theory for locally
convex Hopf algebras. Examples coming from the theory of quantum groups are
reconsidered within our holomorphic deformation scheme and topological duality
theory. It is shown that all the standard quantum groups comprise holomorphic
deformations. Furthermore we show that quantizing the function algebra of a
(Poisson) Lie group and quantizing its universal enveloping algebra are
topologically dual procedures indeed. Thus holomorphic deformation theory seems
to be the appropriate language in which to describe quantum groups as deformed
Lie groups or Lie algebras.

in many ways like a measurement. If two entangled photons are passed through
the interferometer, a certain amount of information is gained about which path

suppressed. However, by inserting a second dielectric into the other arm of the
interferometer, one can restore the interference pattern. Two of these
pseudo-measurements can thus cancel each other out. This is somewhat analogous
to the proposed quantum eraser experiments.
