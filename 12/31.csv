the Mark III catalog to the peculiar velocity and density fields predicted from
the 1.2 Jy IRAS redshift survey. Our goal is to test the relation between the
galaxy density and velocity fields predicted by gravitational instability
theory and linear biasing, and thereby to estimate $\beta_I =
\Omega^{0.6}/b_I,$ where $b_I$ is the linear bias parameter for IRAS galaxies.
Adopting the IRAS velocity and density fields as a prior model, we maximize the
likelihood of the raw TF observables, taking into account the full range of
selection effects and properly treating triple-valued zones in the
redshift-distance relation. Extensive tests with realistic simulated galaxy
catalogs demonstrate that the method produces unbiased estimates of $\beta_I$
and its error. When we apply the method to the real data, we model the presence
of a small but significant velocity quadrupole residual (~3.3% of Hubble flow),
which we argue is due to density fluctuations incompletely sampled by IRAS. The
method then yields a maximum likelihood estimate $\beta_I=0.49\pm 0.07$
(1-sigma error). We discuss the constraints on $\Omega$ and biasing that follow
if we assume a COBE-normalized CDM power spectrum. Our model also yields the
1-D noise noise in the velocity field, including IRAS prediction errors, which
we find to be be 125 +/- 20 km/sec.

CL1821+643 has a rest-frame 0.1-2.4 keV luminosity of 3.74$\pm$0.57
h$_{50}^{-2}$ 10^45 ergs/sec, 38% from a barely resolved cooling flow
component, which places it among the most X-ray luminous clusters known. The
cluster emission complicates interpretation of previous X-ray spectra of this
field; in particular, the observed FeK$\alpha$ emission can probably be
attributed entirely to the cluster, and either the quasar is relatively X-ray
quiet for its optical luminosity or the cluster has a relatively low
temperature for its luminosity. We combine these data with the recent detection
of X-ray emission from the host cluster of the `buried' radio-quiet quasar IRAS
09104+4109, our previous upper limits for the host clusters of two z$\sim$0.7
RLQs, and literature data on FR II radio galaxies and compare to the
predictions of three models for the presence and evolution of powerful AGN in
clusters: the low-velocity-dispersion model, the low-ICM-density model, and the
cooling flow model. Neither of the latter two models can explain all the
observations. We suggest that strong interactions with gas-containing galaxies
may be the only mechanism needed to explain the presence and evolution of
powerful AGN in clusters, consistent with the far-IR and optical properties of
the host galaxies studied here. However, the cooling flow model cannot be ruled
out for at least some objects, and it is likely that both processes are at
work. Each scenario makes predictions for future X-ray and optical observations
which can test their relative importance.

independent, fractal methods. We prove the mixmaster universe is chaotic by
exposing the fractal strange repellor that characterizes the dynamics. The
repellor is laid bare in both the 6-dimensional minisuperspace of the full
Einstein equations, and in a 2-dimensional discretisation of the dynamics. The
chaos is encoded in a special set of numbers that form the irrational Farey
tree. We quantify the chaos by calculating the strange repellor's Lyapunov

quantities are coordinate, or gauge independent, there is no longer any
ambiguity--the mixmaster universe is indeed chaotic.

D56 (1997) 2281-2290","10.1103/PhysRevD.56.2281","KYUSHU-HET-36","hep-th",,"  Among various approaches in proving gauge independence, models containing an
explicit gauge dependence are convenient. The well-known example is the gauge
parameter in the covariant gauge fixing which is of course most suitable for
the perturbation theory but a negative metric prevents us from imaging a
dynamical picture. Noncovariant gauge such as the Coulomb gauge is on the
contrary used for many physical situations. Therefore it is desirable to
include both cases. More than ten years ago, Steinmann introduced a function
(distribution) which can play this role in his attempt on discussing quantum
electrodynamics (QED) in terms of the gauge invariant fields solely. The method
is, however, broken down in the covariant case: the invariant operators are
ill-defined because of 1/p^2 singularity in the Minkowski space. In this paper,
we apply his function to the path integral: utilizing the arbitrariness of the
function we first restrict it to be able to have a well- defined operator, and
then a Hamiltonian with which we can build up the (Euclidean) path integral
formula. Although the formula is far from covariant, a full covariant
expression is recovered by reviving the components which have been discarded
under the construction of the Hamiltonian. There is no pathological defects
contrary to the operator formalism. With the aid of the path integral formula,
the gauge independence of the free energy as well as the S-matrix is proved.
Moreover the reason is clarified why it is so simple and straightforward to
argue gauge transformations in the path integral. Discussions on the quark
confinement is also presented.

no evidence of deviations from Poissonian behavior and, in particular, no sign

of the fluctuations for the subset of decays accompanied by gamma, and
corresponding limits for the total number of beta-decays. In particular, the
magnitude of a hypothetical flicker floor is strongly bounded also for the
beta-decay. This result further constrains theories predicting anomalous
fluctuations in nuclear decays.

formalism has fallen into disuse since the birth of exterior calculus. However,
differentials of higher order are useful objects that can be interpreted in
terms of functions on iterated tangent bundles (or in terms of jets). We
generalize this notion to the case of non commutative differential geometry.
For an arbitrary associative algebra A, one already knows how to define the
differential algebra Omega(A) of universal differential forms over A. We define
Leibniz forms of order n (these are not forms of degree n, ie they are not
elements of Omega^n A) as particular elements of what we call the ``iterated
frame algebra'' of order n, F_n A, which is itself defined as the 2^n tensor
power of the algebra A. We give a system of generators for this iterated frame
algebra and identify the A-module of forms of order n as a particular vector
subspace included in the space of universal one-forms built over the iterated
frame algebra of order n-1. We study the algebraic structure of these objects,
recover the case of the commutative differential calculus of order n (Leibniz
differentials) and give a few examples.

dynamics are studied using fluid moment equations with an approximate closure
anzatz. Resonant particle effects are modelled by incorporating an additional
term representing dissipation akin to parallel heat conduction. Unlike
collisional dissipation, parallel heat conduction is presented by an integral
operator. The modified derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation thus has a
spatially nonlocal nonlinear term describing the long-time evolution of the
envelope of parallel-propagating Alfven waves, as well. Coefficients in the
nonlinear terms are free of the 1/(1-beta) singularity usually encountered in
previous analyses, and have very a simple form which clarifies the physical
processes governing the large amplitude Alfvenic nonlinear dynamics. The
nonlinearity appears via coupling of an Alfvenic mode to a kinetic ion-acoustic
mode. Damping of the nonlinear Alfven wave appears via strong Landau damping of
the ion-acoustic wave when the electron-to-ion temperature ratio is close to
unity. For a (slightly) obliquely propagating wave, there are finite Larmor
radius corrections in the dynamical equation. This effect depends on the angle
of wave propagation relative to B_0 and vanishes for the limit of strictly
parallel propagation. Explicit magnetic perturbation envelope equations
amenable to further analysis and numerical solution are obtained. Implications
of these models for collisionless shock dynamics are discussed.

collisional dissipation, and finite Larmor radius terms) on the nonlinear
evolution of finite amplitude Alfvenic wave trains in a finite-beta environment
is systematically investigated using a novel, kinetic nonlinear Schrodinger
(KNLS) equation. The dynamics of Alfven waves is sensitive to the sense of
polarization as well as the angle of propagation with respect to the ambient
magnetic field. Numerical solution for the case with Landau damping reveals the
formation of dissipative structures, which are quasi-stationary, S-polarized
directional (and rotational) discontinuities which self-organize from parallel
propagating, linearly polarized waves. Parallel propagating circularly
polarized packets evolve to a few circularly polarized Alfven harmonics on
large scales. Stationary arc-polarized rotational discontinuities form from
obliquely propagating waves. Collisional dissipation, even if weak, introduces
enhanced wave damping when beta is very close to unity. Cyclotron motion
effects on resonant particle interactions introduce cyclotron resonance into
the nonlinear Alfven wave dynamics.
