dimensionless, normalized distributions that describe the spatial variation of

classification of IR spectra. We develop a new, fully scale-free method for
solving radiative transfer, present exact numerical results, and derive
approximate analytical solutions for spherical geometry, covering the entire

radiation emerging from accretion disk atmospheres in active galactic nuclei.
We extend our previous work on this subject by exploring the interaction
between Faraday rotation and absorption opacity in local, plane-parallel
atmospheres with parameters appropriate for accretion discs. Faraday rotation
in pure scattering atmospheres acts to depolarize the radiation field by
rotating the polarization planes of photons after last scattering. Absorption
opacity in an unmagnetized atmosphere can increase or decrease the polarization
compared to the pure scattering case, depending on the thermal source function
gradient. Combining both Faraday rotation and absorption opacity, we find the
following results. If absorption opacity is much larger than scattering opacity
throughout the atmosphere, then Faraday rotation generally has only a small
effect on the emerging polarization because of the small electron column
density along a photon mean free path. However, if the absorption opacity is
not too large and it acts alone to increase the polarization, then the effects
of Faraday rotation can be enhanced over those in a pure scattering atmosphere.
Finally, while Faraday rotation often depolarizes the radiation field, it can
in some cases increase the polarization when the thermal source function does
not rise too steeply with optical depth. We confirm the correctness of the
Silant'ev (1979) analytic calculation of the high magnetic field limit of the
pure scattering atmosphere, which we incorrectly disputed in our previous
paper.

distribution in the dominant group elliptical NGC 5846, using the Hubble Space
Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). The two peaks are
located at V-I = 0.96 and 1.17, which roughly correspond to metallicities of
[Fe/H] = -1.2 and -0.2 respectively. The luminosity functions of the blue and
red subpopulations appear to be the same, indicating that luminosity does not
correlate with metallicity within an individual galaxy's globular cluster
system. Our WFPC2 data cover three pointings allowing us to examine the spatial
distribution of globular clusters out to 30 kpc (or 2.5 galaxy effective
radii). We find a power law surface density with a very flat slope, and a
tendency for globular clusters to align close to the galaxy minor axis. An
extrapolation of the surface density profile, out to 50 kpc, gives a specific
frequency S_N = 4.3 +/- 1.1. Thus NGC 5846 has a much lower specific frequency
than other dominant ellipticals in clusters but is similar to those in groups.
The central galaxy regions reveal some filamentary dust features, presumably
from a past merger or accretion of a gas-rich galaxy. This dust reaches to the
very nucleus and so provides an obvious source of fuel for the radio core. We
have searched for proto-globular clusters that may have resulted from the
merger/accretion and find none. Finally, we briefly discuss the implications of
our results for globular cluster formation mechanisms.

bias of the MBG survey towards the low-excitation and metal rich Starburst
Nucleus Galaxies (SBNGs). The spectral characteristics of the MBGs are similar
to those of the infrared luminous IRAS galaxies. As a common characteristic,
they show a mean ratio Log([NII]/H$\alpha$) in excess of 0.2 dex as compared to
normal disk HII regions. In general, the MBGs have lower far-infrared
luminosities ($L_{IR} < 10^{11} L_{\odot}$) and are nearer (z < 0.05) than the
luminous IRAS galaxies.
  The distribution of the morphologies of the MBGs indicates a high number of
early-type spirals (Sb and earlier). Nearly half of these galaxies also possess
a bar. In our sample, the fraction of galaxies with bars depends on the
morphology and increases towards the late-type spirals. However, if we consider
only isolated galaxies, the late-type spirals show a clear tendency to be
barred. Signs of a recent interaction with neighbor galaxies are obvious only
in 24% of our candidates. Although this number is only a lower limit, it is
nevertheless sufficiently low to suggest that in a majority of massive galaxies

extends their treatment by accommodating an arbitrary anisotropy of the source

comptonised radiation in terms of Legendre polynomials and Chebyshev
polynomials. The resulting algebraic eigenvalue problem is then solved by
numerical means, yielding the spectral index and the full angular and spatial
dependence of the specific intensity of radiation. For a thin (\tau_0 < 1)
plasma disk, the radiation is strongly collimated along the disk surface - for
an optical thickness of \tau_0 = 0.05, the radiation intensity along the
surface is roughly ten times that along the direction of the normal, and varies
only slightly with the electron temperature. Our results for the spectral index
confirm those of Titarchuk & Lyubarskij over a wide range of electron

produces a progressive increase of the density of any given fluid element in
its interior. Since the ``chemical'' (or ``beta'') equilibrium state is
determined by the local density, this process leads to a chemical imbalance
quantified by a chemical potential difference, e.g.,
\delta\mu=\mu_n-\mu_p-\mu_e, where n, p, and e denote neutrons, protons, and
electrons. In the presence of superfluid energy gaps, in this case \Delta_n and
\Delta_p, reactions are strongly inhibited as long as both \delta\mu and kT are
much smaller than the gaps. Thus, no restoring mechanism is available, and the
imbalance will grow unimpeded until
\delta\mu=\delta\mu_{thr}=\Delta_n+\Delta_p. At this threshold, the reaction
rate increases dramatically, preventing further growth of \delta\mu, and
converting the excess chemical energy into heat. The thermal luminosity
resulting from this ``rotochemical heating'' process is $L\sim 2\times
10^{-4}(\delta\mu_{thr}/0.1\MeV)\dot E_{rot}$, similar to the typical x-ray

clouds in the galactic halo by measuring the cloud velocity and column density
and assuming a model for the vertical density distribution of the Galactic
interstellar medium. It is shown that falling clouds with $N(H I) < \sim
10^{19} cm^{-2}$ may be decelerated to a terminal velocity which increases with
increasing height above the Galactic plane. This terminal velocity model
correctly predicts the distance to high velocity cloud Complex M and several
other interstellar structures of previously determined distance. It is
demonstrated how interstellar absorption spectra alone may be used to predict
the distances of the clouds producing the absorption. If the distances to the
clouds are already known, we demonstrate how the model may be used to determine
the vertical density structure of the ISM. The derived density distribution is
consistent with the expected density distribution of the warm ionized medium,
characterized by Reynolds. There is also evidence that for $z >\sim 0.4 kpc$
one or more of the following occurs: (1) the neutral fraction of the cloud
decreases to $\sim 31 \pm 14%$, (2) the density drops off faster than
characterized by Reynolds, or (3) there is a systematic decrease in drag
coefficient with increasing z.

previous Boyle's (1992) estimations of k=3.45. A flatter slope beta=-3.72 of

QSOs is concentrated at z<0.6. It results that in the range 0.3<z<0.6 the
luminosity function is flatter than observed at higher redshifts. In this
redshift range, for Mb<-25, 32 QSOs are observed instead of 19 expected from

ellipses and hyperbolae that one would have obtained without the gravomagnetic
monopole.
  The beauty and simplicity of these results has led us to explore the similar
problems in Atomic Physics when the nuclei have an added Dirac magnetic
monopole. These problems have been explored by others and we sketch the
derivations and give details of the predicted spectrum of monopolar hydrogen.
  Finally we return to gravomagnetic monopoles in general relativity. We
explain why NUT space has a non-spherical metric although NUT space itself is
the spherical space-time of a mass with a gravomagnetic monopole. We
demonstrate that all geodesics in NUT space lie on cones and use this result to
study the gravitational lensing by bodies with gravomagnetic monopoles.

Maxwell's equations to allow for magnetic monopoles and their currents so
general relativity would have to be extended to allow torsion for general
distributions of gravomagnetic monopoles and their currents. Of course if
monopoles were never discovered then it would be a triumph for both Maxwellian

In papers of reference [4] a more general situation has been considered in
which the cosmic string carries a magnetic flux $\Phi$ and interacts with a

non-trivial gravitational interaction (i.e, the conical structure) and via
Aharonov-Bohm interaction. In papers [4] the non vanishing VEV of the

four parameters which are completely determined by high-energy $\pi N$ and $K

laser-cooled trapped atomic ions. Building on the scheme of Cirac and Zoller,
we show how the fundamental controlled-NOT gate between a collective mode of
ion motion and the internal states of a single ion can be reduced to a single
laser pulse, and the need for a third auxiliary internal electronic state can
be eliminated.

the encoding cost over the source entropy - of universal data compression in a
parametric setting. We study certain probability distributions for the
two-level quantum systems. We are able to compute exact formulas for the
corresponding redundancies, for which we find the asymptotic limits. These
results are very suggestive and do indeed point towards a possible quantum
extension of the result of Clarke and Barron.

  authors or http://eve.physics.ox.ac.uk/QChome.html",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.56.1177",,"quant-ph",,"  It has recently been shown that there are efficient algorithms for quantum
computers to solve certain problems, such as prime factorization, which are
intractable to date on classical computers. The chances for practical
implementation, however, are limited by decoherence, in which the effect of an
external environment causes random errors in the quantum calculation. To combat
this problem, quantum error correction schemes have been proposed, in which a
single quantum bit (qubit) is ``encoded'' as a state of some larger number of
qubits, chosen to resist particular types of errors. Most such schemes are
vulnerable, however, to errors in the encoding and decoding itself. We examine
two such schemes, in which a single qubit is encoded in a state of $n$ qubits
while subject to dephasing or to arbitrary isotropic noise. Using both
analytical and numerical calculations, we argue that error correction remains
beneficial in the presence of weak noise, and that there is an optimal time
between error correction steps, determined by the strength of the interaction
with the environment and the parameters set by the encoding.
