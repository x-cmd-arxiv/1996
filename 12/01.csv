challenge to cosmological models. The velocity field within 5h-1 Mpc of the
Local Group (LG) is extremely ``cold''. The deviation from a pure Hubble flow,
characterized by the observed radial peculiar velocity dispersion, is measured
to be about 60km/s. We compare the local velocity field with similarly defined
regions extracted from N-body simulations of Universes dominated by cold dark
matter (CDM). This test is able to strongly discriminate between models that
have different mean mass densities. We find that neither the Omega=1 (SCDM) nor
Omega=0.3 (OCDM) cold dark matter models can produce a single candidate Local
Group that is embedded in a region with such small peculiar velocities. For
these models, we measure velocity dispersions between 500-700km/s and
150-300km/s respectively, more than twice the observed value. Although both CDM
models fail to produce environments similar to those of our Local Group on a
scale of a few Mpc, they can give rise to many binary systems that have similar
orbital properties as the Milky Way--Andromeda system. The local,
gravitationally induced bias of halos in the CDM ``Local Group'' environment,
if defined within a sphere of 10 Mpc around each Local Group is about 1.5,
independent of Omega. No biasing scheme could reconcile the measured velocity
dispersions around Local Groups with the observed one. Identification of binary
systems using a halo finder (named Skid
(http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/tools/DENMAX for a public version)) based
on local density maxima instead of a simple linking algorithm, gives a much
more complete sample. We show that a standard ``friend of friends'' algorithm
would miss 40% of the LG candidates present in the simulations.

  301-328",,,"cs.AI",,"  A new method is proposed for exploiting causal independencies in exact
Bayesian network inference. A Bayesian network can be viewed as representing a
factorization of a joint probability into the multiplication of a set of
conditional probabilities. We present a notion of causal independence that
enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a
combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain
factorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal
independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given
its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as
``or'', ``sum'' or ``max'', on the contribution of each parent. We start with a
simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a
query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of
the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal
independence. Empirical studies, based on the CPCS networks for medical
diagnosis, show that this method is more efficient than previous methods and
allows for inference in larger networks than previous algorithms.

associate $J/\psi+\gamma$ production remains to be useful as a clean channel to
probe the unpolarized and polarized gluon distribution inside proton (and
photon), and to study heavy quarkonia production mechanism. We discuss in
detail the associate production of $J/\psi+\gamma$ at $p \overline{p}$ (or
$pp$) and $ep$ colliders. By requiring the $J/\psi$ to decay into an $e^+e^-$
or $\mu^+ \mu^-$ pair, we end up with an exceptionally clean final state. This
process can therefore serve as a very clean probe of the gluon densities inside
the proton as well as the photon. Numerical results are presented for the
TEVATRON $p \overline{p}$ and HERA $ep$ colliders. This same mechanism can be

challenging problems are posed by this nexus of knot/number/field theory:
enumeration of positive knots, and enumeration of irreducible MZVs. Both were
recently tackled by Broadhurst and Kreimer (BK). Here we report large-scale
analytical and numerical computations that test, with considerable severity,

simpler than that of BGK. It enables us to develop 8 new terms in the
epsilon-expansion with $D=3-2\epsilon$. These involve alternating Euler sums,
for which the basis of irreducibles is larger. We conclude that massless
Feynman diagrams in odd spacetime dimensions share the greater transcendental

squeezed coherent states is given explicitly in terms of Hermite polynomials of
two variables. The Wigner and the coherent-state quasiprobabilities are also
presented in closed form through the Hermite polynomials and their limiting
cases. Expectation values of photon numbers and their dispersion are
calculated. Some three-dimensional plots of photon distributions for different
squeezing parameters demonstrating oscillatory behaviour are given.

field in nonlinear and inhomogeneous media. Given the dielectric function and
nonlinear susceptibilities, the Hamiltonian of the electromagnetic field is
determined completely by this quantization method. From Heisenberg's equations
we derive Maxwell's equations for the field operators. When the nonlinearity
goes to zero, this quantization method returns to the generalized canonical
quantization procedure for linear inhomogeneous media [Phys. Rev. A, 43, 467,
1991]. The explicit Hamiltonians for the second-order and third-order nonlinear
quasi-steady-state processes are obtained based on this quantization procedure.
