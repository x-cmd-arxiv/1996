introduce two classes (for the models A and B) of Calabi-Yau manifolds fibrated
by K3 surfaces with some special Picard lattices. These two classes are related
with automorphic forms on IV type domains which we studied in our papers
\cite{GN1}-\cite{GN6}. Conjecturally these automorphic forms take part in the
quantum intersection pairing for model A, Yukawa coupling for model B and
mirror symmetry between these two classes of Calabi-Yau manifolds. Recently
there were several papers by physicists where it was shown on some examples. We
propose a problem of classification of introduced Calabi-Yau manifolds. Our
papers \cite{GN1}-\cite{GN6} and \cite{N3}-\cite{N14} give a hope that this is
possible. They describe possible Picard or transcendental lattices of general
K3 fibers of the Calabi-Yau manifolds.

there any evidence that the situation has changed very much at all in the last
couple of decades? And 3), is a measurement of H0 accurate to 10% feasible with
current observational tools? Recent results on the extragalactic distance scale
are extremely encouraging. A large number of independent methods (including the
latest type Ia supernova calibration by Sandage et al. 1996) appear to be
converging on a value of H0 in the range of 60 to 80 km/sec/Mpc. The
factor-of-two discrepancy in H0 appears to be behind us. However, all of these
results underscore the importance of reducing remaining uncertainties in the
Cepheid distance scale (e.g., reddening and metallicity). A summary of recent
results from the HST H0 Key Project is given. At the present time, a value of
H0=73 +/- 6 (statistical) +/- 8 (systematic) km/sec/Mpc is obtained. This value
is based on the Cepheid calibration of several different methods including the
Tully-Fisher relation, type Ia supernovae, a calibration of distant clusters
tied to the Fornax cluster, and direct Cepheid distances out to about 20 Mpc.
The uncertainty in this estimate will decrease as further Cepheid calibrators
become available over the course of the Key Project; the goal is to measure H0

modeled this galaxy as a system with a centrally-concentrated mass profile,

Sgr, and by implication other dSph galaxies, do not have a
centrally-concentrated profile for their dark matter. We develop a model in
which the stars of the Sgr dwarf are embedded in a constant-density dark matter
halo, representing the core of a tidally-limited system, and show that this is

observations of Sgr and show these data are consistent with this explanation

simulated terminal-velocity plots for the ISM from our model luminosity
distributions. By comparing these plots with observed terminal velocities we
determine the mass-to-light ratio of the near-IR bulge and disk.
  Assuming that all this mass contributes to gravitational microlensing we
compute optical depths $\tau$ for microlensing in Galactic-centre fields. For
three models with bar major axis between $10\deg-25\deg$ from the Sun-Galactic
Center line, the resulting optical depths in Baade's window lie in the range
$0.83\times10^{-6} \lta \tau \lta 0.89\times10^{-6}$ for main-sequence stars

indistinguishable from their counterparts in Coma in all their studied

from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared colors, mean surface brightness
and luminosity function in the restframe photographic J band, homogeneity in
color (around the color-magnitude relation). Furthermore ellipticals and
lenticulars are separately homogeneous in their mean surface brightness, and
have similar relative mean surface brightnesses in both clusters. Spirals are
overabundant in Cl0939+4713 with respect to Coma, but twice less than
previously estimated, and are more similar to field spirals than to cluster
spirals. We suggest that the differences in the photometric properties of the
spirals in the two clusters arise from differences in cluster gas density
distribution which ultimately bring star formation in the spirals to a stop in
Coma, but not in Cl0939+4713. The morphological types are segregated along a

complexity. In the idealized case of a sufficiently large, nontransient,

to the system's volume V which defines the regime of extensive chaos. The
extensivity of the fractal dimension suggests a new way to characterize
correlations in high-dimensional systems in terms of an intensive dimension
correlation length $\xi_\delta$. Recent calculations at Duke University show
that $\xi_\delta$ is a length scale smaller than and independent of some
commonly used measures of disorder such as the two-point and mutual-information

model which provides the ``all order'' solution to the doublet-triplet
splitting problem via the missing VEV mechanism -- the Planck scale corrections
only can induce the mu-term naturally of order 1 TeV. An interesting feature of
this model is that all relevant GUT scale VEVs are defined by the single
dimensional parameter in the Higgs superpotential, so that the SO(10) symmetry
breaks down to the MSSM practically at one step, without intermediate stages.
The colour Higgsino mediated d=5 operators can be naturally suppressed. We also
extend the model by implementing $U(1)_A$ as a horizontal symmetry for
explaining the fermion mass and mixing pattern, and obtain a predictive texture
for fermion masses. This model implies a moderate value of $\tan\beta$ ($\sim
6-10$) and leads to five predictions for the low energy observables. It also
leads to the neutrino masses and mixing pattern that could naturally explain
both the atmospheric and solar neutrino problems. In addition, a remarkable
interplay of the SO(10) and $U(1)_A$ symmetries guarantees an automatic R
parity conservation at any order in $M_P^{-1}$, and also suppresses the Planck
scale induced B and L violating d=5 operators to the needed level.

which ends with a short time, large scale reheating period, after which the
universe goes into a radiation dominated stage. An alternative is proposed here
in which the radiation energy density smoothly decreases all during an
inflation-like stage and with no discontinuity enters the subsequent radiation
dominated stage. The scale factor is calculated from standard Friedmann
cosmology in the presence of both radiation and vacuum energy density. A large
class of solutions confirm the above identified regime of non-reheating
inflation-like behavior for observationally consistent expansion factors and
not too large a drop in the radiation energy density. One dynamical realization
of such inflation without reheating is from warm inflation type scenarios.
However the solutions found here are properties of the Einstein equations with
generality beyond slow-roll inflation scenarios. The solutions also can be
continuously interpolated from the non-reheating type behavior to the standard
supercooled limit of exponential expansion, thus giving all intermediate
inflation-like behavior between these two extremes. The temperature of the
universe and the expansion factor are calculated for various cases.
Implications for baryongenesis are discussed. This non-reheating,
inflation-like regime also appears to have some natural features for a universe

string on $T^6$ or the Type IIA string on $K3 \times T^2$. Starting from a
purely bosonic black hole with Kerr angular momentum L, the superpartners are
generated by acting with fermion zero modes, thus filling out the complete
supermultiplet. $L$ is then identified with the superspin. On the heterotic
side, elementary states belong only to short to long multiplets, but Type IIA
elementary states can belong to intermediate multiplets as well. We find that
the black hole gyromagnetic ratios are in perfect agreement with the string
states not only for the BPS states belonging to short multiplets but also for
those belonging to intermediate multiplets. In fact, these intermediate
multiplets provide a stronger test of the black-hole/string-state equivalence
because the gyromagnetic ratios are not determined by supersymmetry alone, in
contrast to those of the short multiplets. We even find agreement between the
non-supersymmetric (but still extremal) black holes and non-BPS string states
belonging to long supermultiplets. In addition to magnetic dipole moments we

rules for the correlation functions. Explicit quantum computations are carried
out in genus one (torus). In particular the two-point function and the chiral

gravitational action, coming from integrating out the fermionic degrees of
freedoom, is presented. It is different from the standard Liouville one: a new

improved, depending also on the Thirring coupling constant. This last feature
opens the possibility of giving a new explicit representation of the minimal

analyzing \bar p p collisions and eta photoproduction off the proton at
threshold, is shown to provide an argument against the octet Goldstone boson
nature of the eta meson. This argument concerns the structure of the strong
isoscalar axial vector current. A vanishing eta-N coupling means a vanishing
contribution of the eta-pole term to the hypercharge nucleon axial vector
current. Therefore, no partial conservation of the latter can be achieved. This
new situation invalidates the octet Goldberger--Treiman relation for the eta-N
coupling constant that is indicative of the octet Goldstone boson nature of the
eta meson. In such a case there is no longer a compelling reason for the
standard belief that the eta meson should be coupled to the hadronic vacuum
through the hypercharge axial vector current. Rather, it will be coupled to it
as any ordinary neutral pseudoscalar meson via the neutral axial vector current
of the electroweak theory. As a result of the suggested universal structure of
the weak and strong neutral axial vector currents the eta meson satisfies the
strange analog of the Goldberger-Treiman relation so that it acquires features
of a strange Goldstone boson. Hence the eta-NN vertex constant appears
proportional to $\Delta s$, the fraction of nucleon spin carried by the strange
quark sea, thus explaining its suppression naturally.

solvable lattice models of vertex- and IRF-type, yield representations of the
Birman-Wenzl-Murakami algebra. From these, representations of a two-colour
generalization of the Birman-Wenzl-Murakami algebra can be constructed, which
in turn are used to derive trigonometric solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation.
In spirit, this construction resembles the fusion procedure, in the sense that
starting from known solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation new solutions can be
obtained.
