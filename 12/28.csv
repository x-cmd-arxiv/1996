  Academic Publishers",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Using the IRAS Infrared Sky Survey Atlas, we have made 60 x 60 deg mosaics of
the far-infrared emission in the Milky Way. By applying a median normalizing
spatial filter, we were able to eliminate the strong gradient in brightness
towards the Galactic midplane. The resulting images reveal a ""froth"" of
superposed filaments, voids, and shells. This fine-scale structure extends all
the way down to the Galactic midplane. Moreover, it scales in intensity with
the smoothly varying background, independent of latitude, thus indicating that
the fine-scale residual emission is co-extensive with the smooth background. We
conclude that the fine-scale structure is not merely of local origin, but
consists of both nearby and more distant features in the disk. Although we had
expected to find morphological evidence for supernova-driven ""worms"" or
""chimneys"" rooted in the Galactic plane, our processing shows the FIR
fine-scale structure to be more complex (e.g. less coherent and less rooted) as
viewed in projection. Analysis of the spatial statistics shows that the FIR
fine-scale structure is self-similar with a spatial power-law exponent of -3
and a fractal dimension of 2.5 --- similar behavior to that found in isolated
cirrus and molecular clouds. On scales larger than 1.5 deg, the power-law
exponent flattens to -2.5, perhaps indicating a change in the characteristic
structure. This could be due to different dynamical inputs organizing the small
and large-scale structures (e.g. turbulence and diffusion on small scales vs.
macroscopic winds and shock fronts on larger scales).

  rmaaconf.sty; Journal Reference: to be published in Revista Mexicana de
  Astronomia y Astrofisica",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Resolution of nearby giant HII regions into their stellar and nebular
constituents provides fundamental insights for interpreting more distant and
powerful starburst activity. The following summarizes recent advances in our
understanding of the stellar populations and nebular energetics associated with
giant HII regions.
  Photometry and spectroscopy of ionizing clusters in the Galaxy, LMC, and SMC
reveal no significant relation between metallicity and the slope of the
power-law initial mass function (IMF). HST/WFPC2 photometry of 3 giant HII
regions in M33 also does not show any consistent trend involving metal
abundance and IMF slope -- contrary to predictions based on emission-line
ratios. The upper stellar mass limit appears to be constrained more by cluster
age than by anything else.
  The ionizing luminosities from some of the resolved stellar populations are
insufficient to account for the ionization rates inferred from measurements of
the composite (integrated) H-alpha emission. Absorption of stellar EUV emission
by nebular dust grains would only amplify these photoionizing shortfalls.
Leakage of ionizing photons from the HII regions would further exacerbate the
situation. What then is providing the additional ionization? Prospects for
higher stellar EUV luminosities and/or alternative sources of nebular
ionization (e.g. shocks) are evaluated with this question in mind.

the impact of a small spherical companion. Both barred and nonbarred target
discs are considered. We discuss the effect of the properties of the target
disc (distribution of mass in the disc, velocity dispersion, etc.) as well as
of the mass and orbit of the companion on the properties of the rings, such as
their amplitude, width, shape, expansion velocity and lifetime. In particular
the amplitude, width, lifetime and expansion velocity of the first ring
increase considerably with companion mass, and so does the expansion velocity
of the particles in it and the total extent of the disc after the interaction.
We also discuss the formation and evolution of spokes and show that they can be
caused by companions of relatively small mass. In our three examples of oblique
impacts on barred target galaxies we note important transient displacements of
the bar, as well as changes of its pattern speed and size. An asymmetric
pseudoring is formed in each case, and during the first stages of its evolution
the bar forms part of it.

The decay law of prepared initial configuration is worked out in greatest

asymptotically late times can be understood in terms of the overlap probability
of the system variable with the diagonal variable of the entire system.

Gen. 29 (1996), 8097",,,"physics.comp-ph math-ph math.MP",,"  Given a structure made up of n sites connected by b bars, the problem of
recognizing which subsets of sites form rigid units is not a trivial one,
because of the non-local character of rigidity in central-force systems. Even
though this is a very old problem of statics, no simple algorithms are
available for it so the most usual approach has been to solve the elastic
equations, which is very time-consuming for large systems. Recently an integer
algorithm was proposed for this problem in two dimensions, using matching
methods from graph theory and Laman's theorem for two-dimensional graphs. The
method is relatively simple, but its time complexity grows as $n^2$ in the
worst case, and almost as fast on practical cases, so that an improvement is
highly desirable. I describe here a further elaboration of that procedure,
which relies upon the description of the system as a collection of rigid bodies
connected by bars, instead of sites connected by bars. Sets of rigidly
connected objects are replaced by a unique body, and this is done recursively
as more rigid connections between bodies are discovered at larger scales. As a
consequence of this ``rescaling transformation'', our algorithm has much
improved average behavior, even when its worst-case complexity remains $n^2$.
The time complexity of the body-bar algorithm is found to scale as $n^{1.12}$
for the randomly diluted triangular lattice, while the original site-bar
version scales as $n^{1.9}$ on the same problem.
