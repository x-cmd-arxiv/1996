topological field theory in two dimensions coupled to topological gravity, and
may be used to determine the genus 0 (rational) Gromov-Witten invariants of
many projective varieties (as was done for projective spaces by Kontsevich).
  In this paper, we present an equation of a similar universal nature for genus
1 (elliptic) Gromov-Witten invariants -- however, it is much more complicated
than the WDVV equation, and its geometric significance is unclear to us. (Our
prove is rather indirect.) Nevertheless, we show that this equation suffices to
determine the elliptic Gromov-Witten invariants of projective spaces.
  In a sequel to this paper, we will prove that this equation is the only one
other than the WDVV equation which relates elliptic and rational correlation
functions for two-dimensional topological field theories coupled to topological
gravity. It is unclear if there are any further equations of this type on the
small phase space in higher genus, but we think it unlikely. (The genus 0 and 1
cases are special, since the correlation functions on the small phase space
determine those on the large phase space.)

is the ratio of the scale length R_d* of the stellar disk to R0. The disk and
bulge dominate v_c(R) at R<R0 only for R_d*/R0< 0.3. Since the only knowledge
we have of the halo derives from studies like the present one, we allow it to
contribute to the density at all radii. When allowed this freedom, however, the
halo causes changes in assumptions relating to R << R0 to affect profoundly the
structure of the best-fitting model at R >> R0. For example, changing the disk
slightly from an exponential surface-density profile significantly changes the
form of v_c(R) at R >> R0, where the disk makes a negligible contribution to
v_c. Moreover, minor changes in the constraints can cause the halo to develop a
deep hole at its centre that is not physically plausible. These problems call
into question the proposition that flat rotation curves arise because galaxies
have physically distinct halos rather than outwards-increasing mass-to-light
ratios.
  The mass distribution of the Galaxy and the relative importance of its

be used to constrain mass models. Data that constrain the Galactic force field

the distribution of planetary semimajor axes with planetary mass. The search
consists of following ongoing stellar microlensing events involving sources in
the center of the galaxy lensed by intervening stars with high time resolution,
1% photometry in two colors in an attempt to catch any short time scale
planetary perturbations of the otherwise smooth light curve. It is assumed that
3000 events are followed over an 8 year period, but with half of the lenses,
those that are members of binary systems, devoid of planets. The remaining 1500
lenses have solar-system-like distributions of 4 or 5 planets. The expectations
from the microlensing search are extremely assumption dependent with 56, 138,

planetary masses and separations vary with lens mass. The events can be covered
from 54% to 62% of the time on average by high time resolution photometry from
a system of three or four dedicated two meter telescopes distributed in
longitude, so 38% to 46% of the detectable small mass planets (very short
perturbations of the light curve) will be missed. But perturbations comparable
to a day in length means all of the detectable Jupiters and Saturns will in
fact be detected as well as a large fraction of the Uranuses. Although
meaningful statistics on planetary masses and separations can be inferred from
such an intensive search, they, like the inferred data set, will be dependent
on the assumed nature of the systems.

"cond-mat/9612059","Carlos Wexler","C. Wexler and D. J. Thouless","Effective Vortex Dynamics in Superfluid Systems","8 pages, no figures",,,,"cond-mat",,"  An alternative approach to the derivation of the force on a vortex based in
an adiabatic approximation in the action of the superfluid system is developed.
Assuming that the vortex motion is relatively slow compared with the
characteristic times involved in the microscopic degrees of freedom, the effect
of the superfluid and its excitations is reduced to a gauge potential, and the
associated transverse force. The vortex velocity part of the transverse force
is found in terms of the thermal expectation of the angular momentum of the
fluid around the vortex. The excitations countercirculate the vortex reducing
the effective density to that of the superfluid part only.
  Non-adiabatic contributions appear in this formalism as a non-Abelian gauge
potential connecting different microscopic states, in particular the
renormalization of the vortex mass is given by the lowest order diagonal
correction to the adiabatic theory, and the long wavelength contributions found
to depend only on the static structure factor for the fluid.

symmetry breaking and confinement set in. They further argued that that the

function $F_{2}(x)$ in the cumulative region x>1 was found to be roughly
exponential, governed by an effective coupling constant, which depends on the
QCD coupling constant and quark mass. Two mechanisms for cumulative particle
production, direct and spectator ones, were analysed. It was shown that due to
final state interactions the leading terms of the direct mechanism contribution
are cancelled and the spectator mechanism is the dominant one. It leads to a
smaller slope of the particle production rates compared to the slope of the
nuclear structure function in the cumulative region, in agreement with the
