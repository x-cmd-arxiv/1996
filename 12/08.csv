we study the set $\Sigma^k(X)$ of one dimensional local systems on X with
nonvanishing kth cohomology. We show that under certain conditions (X compact,
X has a smooth compactification with trivial first Betti number, or k=1)
$\Sigma^k(X)$ is a union of translates of sets of the form $f^*H^1(T,C^*)$,
where $f:X \to T$ is a holomorphic map to a complex Lie group which is an
extension of a compact complex torus by a product of C^*'s (these correspond to
semiabelian varieties in the algebraic category). This generalizes earlier work
of Beauville, Green, Lazarsfeld, Simpson and the author in the compact case.
The main novelty lies in the proofs which involve consideration of Higgs fields
with logarithmic poles. While a completely satifactory theory of such objects
is still lacking, we are able to work out what we need in the rank one case by
borrowing ideas from mixed Hodge theory. This will appear in the Journal of
Algebraic Geometry.

construct a `periodic orbit theory' of localization by extending the idea of
classical action correlations. This possibility had been questioned by many

trace formula, we formulate a quantal-classical duality relation that connects
the spectral properties of the quantal spectrum to the statistical properties
of lengths of periodic orbits. By identifying the classical correlation scale
it is possible to extend the semiclassical theory of spectral statistics, in
case of a complex systems, beyond the limitations that are implied by the
diagonal approximation. We discuss the quantal dynamics of a particle in a
disordered system. The various regimes are defined in terms of time-disorder
`phase diagram'. As expected, the breaktime may be `disorder limited' rather
than `volume limited', leading to localization if it is shorter than the
ergodic time. Qualitative agreement with scaling theory of localization in one
to three dimensions is demonstrated.

techniques is developed to study its exponentiation. The asymptotic operation

Such expansions generalize and improve upon the well-known short-distance

effective Lagrangians are obtained to all orders of the inverse heavy mass. The
