defined for all Calabi-Yau manifolds, exhibit a specific behavior which is not
present for general K\""ahler manifolds. The variables in question, natural from
a mathematical perspective, are of physical importance because they determine
aspects of the low-energy string physics in four dimensions, such as Yukawa
couplings and threshold corrections. It is shown that these quantities,
evaluated on the complete class of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in weighted
projective 4-space, exhibit scaling behavior with respect to a new scaling

angular momentum has been investigated in the axisymmetric and nonviscous
limit. For an initial state characterized by a Bondi flow with the specific
angular momentum distributed with respect to polar angle, a travelling shock
wave forms which propagates more rapidly in the equatorial plane than in the
plane perpendicular to it resulting in the formation of a hot torus. In cases
where the incoming flow is restricted to lie near the equatorial plane, a
strong wind forms directed away from this plane with the tendency for the
formation of a nonsteady shock structure. As the height of the incoming flow is
increased it is found that the resultant wind weakens. The parameter regime
which delineates accretion flows characterized by a travelling shock and a
nearly standing shock structure is presented.

ranging from about 6,000 to 20,000 counts s$^{-1}$ in the 2 - 12.5 keV energy
band, indicating a strong dependence on source intensity. Strong harmonics are
seen, especially, at lower frequencies. As the QPO frequency increases, the
harmonic feature weakens and disappears. On the soft branch, narrow QPOs are
absent and the low frequency component of the power density spectrum is
approximated by a power-law, with index $\sim -1.25$ for low count rates and
$\sim -1.5$ for high count rates ($\gta 18000$ cts/s). Occasionally, a broad

The source was probably in the very high state similar to those of other black

allowed size for loop production E_c. Certain quantities depend significantly

if no restrictions are placed on loop production, and the fractal dimension of
the string changes smoothly from 2 to 1 as the resolution scale is decreased.
Loops are nearly all produced at the lattice cut-off. We suggest that the
lattice cut-off should be interpreted as corresponding to the string width, and
that in a real network loops are actually produced with this size. This leads
to a radically different string scenario, with particle production rather than
gravitational radiation being the dominant mode of energy dissipation. At the

investigated. The classical system is integrable and exhibits a separatrix,
dividing the phasespace into regions of oscillatory and rotational motion. The
classical separability carries over to quantum mechanics, and the Schr\""odinger
equation is shown to be equivalent to the spheroidal wave equation. The quantum
eigenvalues show a clear pattern when transformed into the classical action
space. The implication of the separatrix on the wave functions is illustrated.
A uniform WKB quantization taking into account complex orbits is shown to be
adequate for the semiclassical quantization in the presence of a separatrix.
The pattern of states in classical action space is nicely explained by this
quantization procedure. We extract an effective Maslov phase varying smoothly
on the energy surface, which is used to modify the Berry-Tabor trace formula,
resulting in a summation over non-periodic orbits. This modified trace formula
produces the correct number of states, even close to the separatrix. The
Fourier transform of the density of states is explained in terms of classical
orbits, and the amplitude and form of the different kinds of peaks is
analytically calculated.

on the boundary to spacetime. After critically discussing several routes for
deriving a boundary action, we examine their hypothesis in the context of
generic 2-D dilaton gravity. We first calculate the corresponding statistical
mechanical entropy of black holes in 1+1 deSitter gravity, which has a gauge
theory formulation as a BF-theory. Then we generalize the method to dilaton
gravity theories that do not have a (standard) gauge theory formulation. This
is facilitated greatly by the Poisson-Sigma-model formulation of these
theories. It turns out that the phase space of the boundary particles coincides
precisely with a symplectic leaf of the Poisson manifold that enters as target
space of the Sigma-model. Despite this qualitatively appealing picture, the
quantitative results are discouraging: In most of the cases the symplectic
leaves are non-compact and the number of microstates yields a meaningless
infinity. In those cases where the particle phase space is compact - such as,
e.g., in the Euclidean deSitter theory - the edge state degeneracy is finite,
but generically it is far too small to account for the semiclassical
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

show that the eigenspinors' energy-momentum is the Jacobian matrix of the

the energy momentum of the trans Planckian eigenspinors scale linearly with the

Born cross section. The initial output of over 20,000 terms could be reduced to
90, only 18 of which are shown to be numerically relevant and for which a

by Susy QM. (2) We explain the relation between topological field theories
calculating signed and unsigned sums of Euler numbers of moduli spaces. (3) We
show that the topological twist of N=4 d=4 Yang-Mills theory recently
constructed by Marcus is formally a deformation of four-dimensional super-BF
theory. (4) We construct a novel N_{T}=2 topological twist of N=4 d=3
Yang-Mills theory, a `mirror' of the Casson invariant model, with some unusual
features. (5) We give a complete classification of the topological twists of
N=8 d=3 Yang-Mills theory and show that they are realised as world-volume
theories of Dirichlet two-brane instantons wrapping supersymmetric three-cycles
of Calabi-Yau three-folds and G_{2}-holonomy Joyce manifolds. (6) We describe
the topological gauge theories associated to D-string instantons on holomorphic
curves in K3s and Calabi-Yau 3-folds.

symmetry is spontaneously broken, the Higgs sector as well has a natural
geometrical interpretation. It turns out that the Higgs field is related to the
gravitational potential.
  Since the full action functional of the standard model is derived in one
stroke, the appropriate parameters of the model have to satisfy certain
relations similar to those in the Connes-Lott approach. Likewise, this may
yield some phenomenological consequences, which is illustrated by using the
gauge group of the standard model in the case of $N-$generations of leptons and

for $f(x)=x$, the effect of this transformation is to rescale the position and
momentum operators by $e^{\epsilon(t)}$ and $e^{-\epsilon(t)}$, respectively.
This transformation is shown to lead to the identification of a previously
unknown class of exactly solvable time-dependent harmonic oscillators. It turns
out that the Caldirola-Kanai oscillator whose mass is given by $m=m_0 e^{\gamma
t}$, belongs to this class. It is also shown that for arbitrary $f(x)$, this
canonical transformations map the dynamics of a free particle with constant
mass to that of free particle with a position-dependent mass. In other words,
