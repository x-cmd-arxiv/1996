analysis suggests that a merger-induced starburst phase may not begin before
the nuclear separation between the merging galaxies reaches roughly 10 kpc. The

Moreover the large initial secondary masses account for the rarity of NLMXBs at
periods less than 3 hr. In contrast, NLMXB populations forming with large kick

is generally small compared to the pre-SN orbital velocity in a large fraction

yield the radius, age, and luminosity of a pre-main sequence star as a function
of lithium depletion. This allows for more direct comparisons to observations
of lithium depleted stars. Our results agree with those numerical calculations
that explicitly determine stellar structure during Hayashi contraction. In
agreement with Basri, Marcy, and Graham (1996), we show that the absence of
lithium in the Pleiades star HHJ 3 implies that it is older than 100 Myr. We
also suggest a generalized method for dating galactic clusters younger than 100

underluminous relative to the expectations of the standard early-and-rapidly

the mean lithium content [Li] = 2.37$+/- 0.08 +/- 0.07 is derived. This value
is slightly higher than the Spite plateau at [Li]=2.19 +/- 0.016 for field halo

upper limit may suggest the presence of some dispersion on the plateau stars of
47Tuc as it is observed in field stars of similar metallicity. When compared
with field dwarfs of [Fe/H] about -0.7 the Li content of 47Tuc turnoff stars is
among the highest observed. Considering the extreme age of 47Tuc this suggests
that no significant depletion affected these stars and it implies a mild Li
Galactic enrichment between the epoch of Pop II formation and the formation of
47Tuc stars with metallicities up to about -0.7. Spallation reactions, as
deduced from Be observations, can account for such an increase. The remaining
two stars are evolved, and only upper limits could be placed at [Li]<0.7 and
<-0.7. These very low values imply some extra depletion mechanism in addition
to dilution as it is observed in evolved field stars by Pilachowki et al (1993)

however, about lensed-quasar statistics at larger image separations, which
probe masses on the scale of galaxy clusters. We extend the results of the HST
Snapshot Survey for Lensed Quasars to the 7''-50'' range for a sub-sample of 76
quasars that is free of known selection effects. Using a combination of
multicolor photometry and spectroscopy, we show that none of the point sources
in the entire field of view of the HST observations of these quasars are lensed
images. Large-separation quasar lensing is therefore not common. We carry out a
detailed calculation of the expected statistics of large-separation lensing for
this quasar sample, incorporating realistic input for the mass profiles and
mass function of galaxy clusters. We find that the observational null results
are consistent with the expected effect of galaxy clusters, even if these have
existed in their present form and number since z of about 2. The rarity of
large-separation lensed quasars can rule out some extreme scenarios, e.g. that
the mass-function of clusters has been severely underestimated, or that large
mass concentrations that are not associated with galaxies (i.e. ``failed''
clusters) are common. The rareness of wide lensing also sets limits on the
cosmological constant that are independent of limits derived from galaxy
lensing. The lensing statistics of larger quasar samples can probe the

analysis are galaxy spectra sampled in 1300 bins between 3750 \AA~ and 6500
\AA. We make use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyse the
1300-dimensional space spanned by the spectra. Their projection onto the plane
defined by the first two principal components, the principal plane, shows that
normal galaxies are in a quasi-linear sequence that we call spectral sequence.
We show that the spectral sequence is closely related to the Hubble
morphological sequence. These results are robust in the sense that the reality
of the spectral sequence does not depend on data normalization. The existence
of this sequence suggests that a single parameter may describe the spectrum of
normal galaxies. We have investigated this hypothesis with Bruzual & Charlot
(1995) models of spectral evolution. We show that, for single age models (15
Gyr), the spectral sequence can be parametrized by the characteristic star
formation time-scales of the different morphological types. By examining the
projection of evolutionary tracks of normal galaxies onto the principal plane,
we verify that the spectral sequence is also an evolutive sequence, with galaxy
spectra evolving from later to earlier spectral types. Considering the close
correspondence between the spectral and morphological sequences, this lead us
to speculate that galaxies may evolve morphologically along the Hubble
sequence, from Sm/Im to E.

slips occurring in sequential pairs, with the second phase slip quickly

periodic solutions of varying complexity and chaotic solutions. In larger

include unifying relativity and quantum mechanics, and particles with de
Broglie waves. It also appears to provide a truly unified physical basis for
electromagnetic, gravitational and nuclear forces. The basic system is a
four-dimensional Euclidean space, containing an array of nonlinear ""flow""
waves. These repeat in one dimension, called [phi]. As in Newtonian mechanics,
time is treated as an additional, unidirectional parameter describing the
evolution of the system. Nevertheless, this wave system is shown be inherently
relativistic. Further self-organizing patterns arise within the overall wave
structure. Called ""wavicles,"" these have intrinsic quantized fields, ""spin,""
and rest energy, and represent elementary particles. Relativistic expressions
are derived for particle behavior in scalar, vector and gravitational
potentials. Proper representations of these potentials, based on the wave
fields and associated [phi] flows of wavicles, are also obtained. As in the
causal quantum mechanics of de Broglie and Bohm, wavicles exist continuously
and follow definite, stochastic trajectories. Although experimentally
equivalent to Einstein's special relativity, this theory differs fundamentally
from his general relativity and the associated Big Bang model. According to
Linde, the latter predict a large-scale space-time curvature roughly 60 orders
of magnitude greater than observed values. Here a flat large-scale geometry is
predicted, in agreement with the observed distribution of galaxies. This theory
is also consistent with recent observations pertaining to the age of the
universe.

quantum states with and without classical analogue. The interplay between
kinematics and dynamics in the evolution of a falling quantum test particle is
discussed allowing for a better understanding of the equivalence principle at
the operational level.

integrals for the motion of a point particle in flat space can be transformed
directly into those in curved space with torsion. Our procedure evolved from
well-established methods in the theory of plastic deformations, where crystals
with defects are described mathematically as images of ideal crystals under
active nonholonomic coordinate transformations.
  Our mapping procedure may be viewed as a natural extension of Einstein's
famous equivalence principle. When applied to time-sliced path integrals, it
gives rise to a new ""quantum equivalence principle"" which determines short-time
action and measure of fluctuating orbits in spaces with curvature and torsion.
The nonholonomic transformations possesses a nontrivial Jacobian in the path
measure which produces in a curved space an additional term proportional to the
curvature scalar R, thus canceling a similar term found earlier by DeWitt. This
cancelation is important for correctly describing semiclassically and quantum
mechanically various systems such as the hydrogen atom, a particle on the
surface of a sphere, and a spinning top. It is also indispensable for the
process of bosonization, by which Fermi particles are redescribed by those
fields.

  castagni@iafe.uba.ar",,,,"quant-ph",,"  It is demonstrated that, making minimal changes in ordinary quantum
mechanics, a reasonable irreversible quantum mechanics can be obtained. This
theory has a more general spectral decompositions, with eigenvectors
corresponding to unstable states that vanish when $t \to \infty .$ These
''Gamov vectors'' have zero norm, in such a way that the norm and the energy of
the physical states remain constant. The evolution operator has no inverse,
showing that we are really dealing with a time-asymmetric theory. Using
Friedrichs model reasonable physical results are obtained, e. g. : the
remaining of an unstable decaying state reappears, in the continuous spectrum
of the model, with its primitive energy.
