Submitted to ApJ, August 1996","Astrophys.J. 487 (1997) 1","10.1086/304578",,"astro-ph",,"  We consider one-loop corrections to the bispectrum and skewness of
cosmological density fluctuations induced by gravitational evolution. As has
been established by comparison with numerical simulations, tree-level
perturbation theory (PT) describes these quantities at the largest scales.
One-loop PT provides a tool to probe the transition to the non-linear regime on
smaller scales. In this work, we find that, as a function of spectral index n,
the one-loop bispectrum follows a pattern analogous to that of the one-loop
power spectrum, which shows a change in behavior at a critical index n_c =
-1.4, where non-linear corrections vanish. For the bispectrum, for n less than
n_c, one-loop corrections increase the configuration dependence of the leading
order contribution; for n greater than n_c, one-loop corrections tend to cancel
the configuration dependence of the tree-level bispectrum, in agreement with
known results from n=-1 numerical simulations. A similar situation is shown to
hold for the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA), where n_c = -1.75. Using
dimensional regularization, we obtain explicit analytic expressions for the
one-loop bispectrum for n=-2 initial power spectra, for both the exact dynamics
of gravitational instability and the ZA. We also compute the skewness factor,
including local averaging of the density field, for n=-2: S_3(R) = 4.02 + 3.83
sigma^2(R) for gaussian smoothing and S_3(R) = 3.86 + 3.18 sigma^2(R) for
top-hat smoothing, where sigma^2(R) is the variance of the density field
fluctuations smoothed over a window of radius R. Comparison with fully
non-linear numerical simulations implies that, for n < -1, one-loop PT can
extend our understanding of nonlinear clustering down to scales where the
transition to the stable clustering regime begins.

  Electrodynamics with quantized Charges","Major revision, 1 figure and 3 subsections added, 20 Pages, 2 tables,
  5 figures",,,,"gr-qc hep-th",,"  In the present paper a geometrization of electrodynamics is proposed which
makes use of a generalization of Riemannian geometry considered already by
Einstein and Cartan in the 20ies. Cartan's differential forms description of a
teleparallel space-time with torsion is modified by introducing distortion
1-forms which correspond to the distortion tensor in dislocation theory. Under
the condition of teleparallelism, the antisymmetrized part of the distorsion
1-form approximates the electromagnetic field, whereas the antisymmetrized part
of torsion contributes to the electromagnetic current. Cartan's structure
equations, the Bianchi identities, Maxwell's equations and the continuity
equation are thus linked in a most simple way. After these purely geometric
considerations a physical interpretation, using analogies to the theory of
defects in ordered media, is given. A simple defect, which is neither a
dislocation nor disclination proper, appears as source of the electromagnetic
field. Since this defect is rotational rather than translational, there seems
to be no contradiction to Noether's theorem as in other theories relating
torsion to electromagnetism. Then,congruences of defect properties and quantum
behaviour that arise are discussed, supporting the hypothesis that elementary
particles are topological defects of space-time. In agreement with the
differential geometry results, a dimensional analysis indicates that the
physical unit (lenght)^2 rather than As is the appropriate unit of the electric
charge.

assuming a proper boundary condition for the propagation of the negative-energy
states. It reduces to the (one-body)Dirac equation in the infinite limit of one
of the constituent mass. It also has the symmetries to assure the existence of
the anti-bound-state with the same mass. The interaction
kernel(pseudo-potential) is systematically constructed by diagonalizing the
Hamiltonian of the background field theory, by which the retardation effects
are included in the interaction. Its wave function at the origin(WFO) behaves
properly in a manner suggested by the covariant field theory. The equation can
well be applied in the heavy quark effective theory.

hyper-Kahler manifold X. A Feynman diagram calculation of its partition
function demonstrates that it is a finite type invariant of 3-manifolds which
is similar in structure to those appearing in the perturbative calculation of
the Chern-Simons partition function.
  The sigma-model suggests a new system of weights for finite type invariants
of 3-manifolds, described by trivalent graphs. The Riemann curvature of X plays
the role of Lie algebra structure constants in Chern-Simons theory, and the
Bianchi identity plays the role of the Jacobi identity in guaranteeing the
so-called IHX relation among the weights.
  We argue that, for special choices of X, the partition function of the
sigma-model yields the Casson-Walker invariant and its generalizations. We also
derive Walker's surgery formula from the SL(2,Z) action on the
finite-dimensional Hilbert space obtained by quantizing the sigma-model on a
two-dimensional torus.

found to be rather sensitive to the amplitudes in the resonance region, in

with the existing threshold data for both charged and neutral pion production.
