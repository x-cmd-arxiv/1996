submanifold of an affine or projective space, let $x\in X$ be a general point,
and let L^k be a linear space of dimension k osculating to order m at x. If m
is large enough, one expects L to be contained in X and thus X contains a
linear space of dimension kthrough almost every point. We show that $L\subset
X$ in the following cases: k=1 and m=n+1; k=n-1, $a\geq 2$, and m=2; $n\geq 4$,
k=n-2 and m=4. We prove these results by first deriving the order of osculation
that generically implies containment and then showing that in these cases
containment must occur.
  If X is a patch of a projective variety, we address the question as to
whether X can be a smooth variety. We show that if there is a P^k through each
point and $codim(X)<\frac{k}{n-k}$ then X cannot be a smooth variety.

the limits by a factor of 3-4 within a perturbative treatment that neglects

  for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/286.4.825",,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss the merging rates in compact groups of 5 identical elliptical
galaxies. All groups have the same mass and binding energy. We consider both
cases with individual halos and cases where the halo is common to all galaxies
and enveloping the whole group. In the latter situation the merging rate is
slower if the halo is more massive. The mass of individual halos has little
influence on the merging rates, due to the fact that all galaxies in our
simulations have the same mass, and so the more extended ones have a smaller
velocity dispersion. Groups with individual halos merge faster than groups with
common halos if the configuration is centrally concentrated, like a King
distribution of index 10. On the other hand for less concentrated
configurations the merging is initially faster for individual halo cases, and
slower after part of the group has merged. In cases with common halo, centrally
concentrated configurations merge faster for high halo-to-total mass ratios and
slower for low halo-to-total mass ratios. Groups whose virial ratio is
initially less than one merge faster, while groups that have initially
cylindrical rotation merge slower than groups starting in virial equilibrium.
In order to test how long a virialised group can survive before merging we
followed the evolution of a group with a high halo-to-total mass ratio and a
density distribution with very little central concentration. We find that the
first merging occurred only after a large number of crossing times, which with
areasonable calibration should be larger than a Hubble time. Hence, at least
for appropriate initial conditions, the longevity of compact groups is not
necessarily a problem, which is an alternative explanation to why we observe so
many compact groups despite the fact that their lifetimes seem short.

mixing of fuel and products either inside an active deflagration front or
during the global expansion and subsequent contraction of an exploding white

much larger than the width of the reaction front of a Chapman-Jouguet
detonation. However, at densities greater than simeq 5 x 10^6 g cm^-3, it is
much smaller than the size of a white dwarf. We derive the critical turbulent
intensity required to create the mixed region inside an active deflagration

notion of quasi-isolated systems is introduced, for which it is possible to
describe the state of macroscopic systems by a collection of intensive

qualitatively different steps. The theory is applied and verified by describing

rules and low-energy theorems. In the scalar sector, one finds a gluonium
having a mass $M_G=(1.5\pm 0.2)$ GeV, which decays mainly into the $U(1)_A$
channels $\eta\eta'$ and 4$\pi^0$. However, for a consistency of the whole
approach, one needs broad-low mass gluonia (the $\sigma$ and its radial
excitation), which couple strongly to the quark degrees of freedom similarly to
the $\eta'$ of the $U(1)_A$ sector. Combining these results with the ones for
the $\bar qq$ quarkonia, we present maximal quark-gluonium mixing schemes,
which can provide quite a good description of the complex spectra and various
decay widths of the observed scalar mesons
$\sigma(1.0),f_0(0.98),f_0(1.37),f_0(1.5)$ and $f_J(1.71)$. In the tensor
sector, the gluonium mass is found to be $M_T\simeq (2.05\pm 0.19)$ GeV, which
makes the $\zeta(2.2)$ a good $2^{++}$ gluonium candidate, even though we
expect a rich population of $2^{++}$ gluonia in this region. In the
pseudoscalar channel, the gluonium mass is found to be $M_P\simeq (2.05\pm
0.19)$ GeV, while we also show that the $E/\iota(1.44)$ couples more weakly to
the gluonic current than the $\eta'$, which can favour its interpretation as
the first radial excitation of the $\eta'(0.96)$.

  given at ISHEPP, Dubna, September 1996",,,"MIT-CTP 2595","nucl-th",,"  Experimental evidence has been growing for the existence of both molecular
and exotic dibaryons. The former are dominated by hadron and the latter by
quark-gluon degrees of freedom. Exotic dihadrons are of particular interest
because their properties are closely related to the parameters and
non-perturbative properties of QCD models. Molecular structures provide
information about confinement. Purely exotic models, such as bag and valence
quark models, ignore the multi-hadron phase of confinement. Multi-configuration
quark models and R-matrix boundary condition models better represent the medium
range repulsive effects leading to confinement, predicting higher excitation
energies of the exotic resonances. The ^1S_0 exotic predicted at 2.70 GeV mass
has been identified in pp spin observables, implying that there are several
more even and odd parity exotics in the NN system between 2.6 and 3.0 GeV. The
method also predicts exotic strange and doubly strange dibaryons (including a
di-lambda unbound by about 0.13 GeV) and exotics in baryon and meson channels.
The R-matrix formalism also describes the properties of molecular structures
and enables a classification of these into several types. Observed and
predicted examples of each type are discussed, including the recently observed
d'.
