images of a lensed quasar, after removal of the time delay, may be caused by
hot spots or other moving structures in the accretion disk crossing microlens
caustics caused by stellar mass objects in the lensing galaxy. Such variability
has been reported in the two images of 0957+561. The short durations would be
due to the high rotation speed of the disk (v/c ~ 0.1), rather than planetary
mass objects in the slowly moving (v/c ~ 0.001) lens. This interpretation could
be confirmed by finding periodicity, or correlations of the spectral and flux
variations due to the Doppler effect in the disk. We also propose another
signature of stationary accretion disks (with no intrinsic variability): the
gradient of the magnification over the accretion disk should cause a relative
color change between the images whose sign and amplitude are correlated with
the time derivative of the flux difference between the images. Other color
terms induced by the radial variation of disk colors are of second order in the
magnification gradient. The methods proposed here can be used first to verify
that accretion disks near supermassive black holes are the source of the
continuum radiation from quasars, and then to study them.

find that the theory can be expressed as a sum over topologically inequivalent

sum is given by the product of one factor per branching point of the surface.
Therefore branching points play the role of elementary vertices of the theory.
Their value is determined by the matrix elements of the hamiltonian constraint,

  paper pa11-048 and RU-96-71 (hep-ph/9608387)",,,"RU-96-93","hep-ph",,"  The tree-level-massless gaugino scenario predicts that the lighter chargino
mass is less than m_W and that gluino and lightest neutralino masses are $\lsi
1$ GeV. In this case the dominant decay mode of charginos and non-LSP
neutralinos is generically to three jets. The excess of ""4j"" events with total
invariant mass $\sim 105$ GeV observed in LEP running at 130-136 GeV is noted
to be consistent with pair production of $\sim 53$ GeV charginos. Data at 161
and 172 GeV from Fall, 1996, cannot conclusively test this hypothesis (because
cuts to eliminate $W^+W^-$ background reduce the efficiency significantly) but
is suggestive that the signal persists.

to neutrinoless double beta decay via the pion exchange between decaying
neutrons. The pion coupling to the final state electrons is induced by the
R-parity violating SUSY interactions. We have found this pion-exchange
mechanism to dominate over the conventional two-nucleon one. The latter
corresponds to direct interaction between quarks from two decaying neutrons
without any light hadronic mediator like pion. The constraints on the certain
R-parity violating SUSY parameters are extracted from the current experimental
neutrinoless double beta decay half-life limit. These constraints are
significantly stronger than those previously known or expected from the ongoing
accelerator experiments.

results of both the standard quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA)
