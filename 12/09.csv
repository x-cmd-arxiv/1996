  Astrophys. main Journal",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present high spatial resolution observations of the blue compact dwarf
galaxy IZW18 performed in the Halpha line with a scanning Fabry-Perot
interferometer at the CFH telescope. Morphological structure of the galaxy in
Halpha and in the red continuum is investigated. We also analyse the velocity
field of the ionized gas. Besides the two compact HII components of the main
body we find a population of small HII regions in its surroundings whose
diameter distribution and Halpha luminosity function are consistent with those
observed in dwarf Irregular galaxies. In the main body of the galaxy besides of
the NW and SE red continuum peaks which are displaced with respect to the
Halpha maxima, three new red condensations have been discovered. They have no
clear Halpha counterparts. The velocity field in IZW18 shows peculiar motions
superimposed on a quite regular background implying solid-body rotation with a
gradient of about 70km/sec/ kpc. The Halpha line profiles exhibit an asymmetric
structure, except for the NW main compact component. At least part of this
asymmetry could result from accreted and/or expelled surrounding gas from the
main star-forming core(s) of the galaxy. Contrary to previous suggestions that
the south-west and north-east extensions of this galaxy are diffused emission
produced by bipolar emitting gas we provide evidence that they are HII regions
powered by star formation sites. The redshift of the Zwicky's ""flare"" has been
measured for the first time and corresponds to the same velocity as IZW18. In
such a context the optical ridge that appears to be an isolated morphological
structure has a shape that may result from the gravitational interaction with
the Zwicky's ""flare"" if this latter is a neighbour extreme dwarf object.

a new kind of gravitational charge that couples to a short range gravitational
interaction mediated by a massive vector field. A model is constructed that
assimilates this concept into ideas of current inflationary cosmology. The
model is also consistent with the observed behaviour of galactic rotation
curves according to Newtonian dynamics. The essential idea is that stars
composed of ordinary (as opposed to dark matter) experience Newtonian forces
due to the presence of an all pervading background of massive gravitationally
charged cold dark matter. The novel gravitational interactions are predicted to
have a significant influence on pre-inflationary cosmology. The precise details
depend on the nature of a gravitational Proca interaction and the description
of matter. A gravitational Proca field configuration that gives rise to
attractive forces between dark matter charges of like polarity exhibits
homogeneous isotropic eternal cosmologies that are free of cosmological
curvature singularities thus eliminating the horizon problem associated with
the standard big-bang scenario. Such solutions do however admit dense hot
pre-inflationary epochs each with a characteristic scale factor that may be
correlated with the dark matter density in the current era of expansion. The
model is based on a theory in which a modification of Einsteinian gravity at
very short distances can be expressed in terms of the gradient of the Einstein
metric and the torsion of a non-Riemannian connection on the bundle of linear
frames over spacetime. Indeed we demonstrate that the genesis of the model
resides in a remarkable simplification that occurs when one analyses the
variational equations associated with a broad class of non-Riemannian actions.

context of (1+1)-dimensional gauge theories. We begin by reviewing the known
light-front solution of the Schwinger model, highlighting the issues that are
relevant for reproducing the $\theta$-structure of the vacuum. The most
important of these are the need to introduce degrees of freedom initialized on
two different null planes, the proper incorporation of gauge field zero modes
when periodicity conditions are used to regulate the infrared, and the
importance of carefully regulating singular operator products in a
gauge-invariant way. We then consider SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in 1+1 dimensions
coupled to massless adjoint fermions. With all fields in the adjoint
representation the gauge group is actually SU(2)$/Z_2$, which possesses
nontrivial topology. In particular, there are two topological sectors and the
physical vacuum state has a structure analogous to a $\theta$ vacuum. We
formulate the model using periodicity conditions in $x^\pm$ for infrared
regulation, and consider a solution in which the gauge field zero mode is
treated as a constrained operator. We obtain the expected $Z_2$ vacuum
structure, and verify that the discrete vacuum angle which enters has no effect
on the spectrum of the theory. We then calculate the chiral condensate, which
is sensitive to the vacuum structure. The result is nonzero, but inversely
proportional to the periodicity length, a situation which is familiar from the
Schwinger model. The origin of this behavior is discussed.
