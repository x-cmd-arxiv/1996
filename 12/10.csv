The model is based on the idea that the BL Lacs constitute a ``parameterized

is (or is associated with) the bolometric luminosity. Assuming an empirical
relation between spectral shape and luminosity the observational properties of
the two surveys, including the redshift distributions, can be reasonably well

objects to peak at lower frequencies; iii) the ratio between the two peak

Alfv\'en heating (AH) as a heating/excitation mechanism of optical filaments in
cooling flows. We use a time-dependent hydrodynamical code to follow the
evolution of cooling condensations arising from the $10^7$ K cooling flow. The
filaments contain magnetic fields and AH is at work at several degrees of
efficiency (including no AH at all). We consider two damping mechanisms of
Alfv\'en waves: nonlinear and turbulent. We calculate the optical line emission
associated with the filaments and compare our results to the observations. We
find that AH can be an important ionizing and heating source for class I

important contributor to [OI]$\lambda 6300$ emission even for the more luminous

spike) that appears downstream of strong, cosmic-ray-modified shocks. This
feature results from temporary overcompression of the flow by the combined
cosmic-ray shock precursor/gas subshock. Formation of the density spike is
expected whenever shock modification by cosmic-ray pressure increases strongly.
That occurence may be anticipated for newly generated strong shocks or for
cosmic-ray-modified shocks encountering a region of higher external density,
for example. The predicted mass density within the spike increases with the
shock Mach number and with shocks more dominated by cosmic-ray pressure. We
find this spike to be linearly unstable under a modified Rayleigh-Taylor
instability criterion at the early stage of its formation. We confirm this
instability numerically using two independent codes based on the two-fluid
model for cosmic-ray transport. These two-dimensional simulations show that the
instability grows impulsively at early stages and then slows down as the
gradients of total pressure and gas density decrease. Observational discovery
of this unstable density spike behind shocks, possibly through radio emission
enhanced by the amplified magnetic fields would provide evidence for the
existence of strongly cosmic-ray modified shock structures.

N self-gravitating particles, without any source for the radiation of energy,
we have been able to calculate the binding energy of the system by treating
these particles as fermions. Our expression for the ground state energy of the
system shows a dependence of $N^{7/3}$ on the particle number, which is in
agreement with the results obtained by other workers. We also arrive at a
compact expression for the radius of a star following which we correctly
reproduce the nucleon number to be found in a typical star. Using this value,
we obtain the well-known result for the limiting value of the mass, M, of a
neutron star $(M \simeq 3.12 M_{\odot}, M_{\odot}$ being the solar mass) beyond
which the black hole formation should take place. Generalizing the present
calculation to the case of white dwarfs,we have been able to obtain the so
called Chandrasekhar limit for the mass, $M_{Ch}$, $(M_{Ch}\simeq 1.44
M_{\odot})$ below which the stars are expected to go over to the white dwarf
state. We reproduce this by introducing a radius, equivalent to Schwarzschild
radius, at the interface of the neutron stars and white dwarfs. This is
justified by considering the fact that it gives rise to the correct value for
the degree of ionization $\mu_e (\mu_e\approx 2)$ for heavy nuclei.

approach starts with Sparling's tetrad-dependent differential forms, and our
wave equation governs the propagation of Sparling's 2-form, which in the

the desired end state of the gravitational collapse one has to give a suitable
initial velocity to the cloud. We also characterize here a wide new family of

the effective string action is only a cut-off theory for finite values of the
