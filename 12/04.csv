gas and intrinsic X-ray absorbing material in a sample of nearby, X-ray bright
cooling flow clusters observed with the Position Sensitive Proportional Counter
(PSPC) on ROSAT. Our method of analysis employs X-ray colour profiles, formed
from ratios of the surface brightness profiles of the clusters in selected
energy bands, and an adapted version of the deprojection code of Fabian et. al
(1981). We show that all of the cooling flow clusters in our sample exhibit
significant central concentrations of cooling gas. At larger radii the clusters
appear approximately isothermal. In detail, the spatial distributions and
emissivity of the cooling material are shown to be in excellent agreement with
the predictions from the deprojection code, and can be used to constrain the
ages of the cooling flows. The X-ray colour profiles also indicate substantial
levels of intrinsic X-ray absorption in the clusters. The intrinsic absorption
increases with decreasing radius, and is confined to the regions occupied by
the cooling flows. We explore a range of likely spatial distributions for the
absorbing gas and discuss the complexities involved in the measurement of
column densities from X-ray data. Comparison of our results with previously
reported observations made with Einstein Observatory Solid State Spectrometer
(White et. al 1991) shows reasonable agreement, but requires that the absorbing
material only partially covers the X-ray emitting regions. The results
presented in this paper provide strong support for the standard model of
inhomogeneous cooling flows in clusters of galaxies.

zone models by incorporating propagation of material and energy in the disk.
For reasonable values of the parameters the homogeneous steady state is
unstable to the development of inhomogeneities, leading to the development of
spatial and temporal structure. At the linearized level a prediction for the
length and time scales of the patterns is found. These instabilities arise for
the same reason that pattern formation is seen in non-equilibrium chemical and
biological systems, which is that the positive and negative feedback effects
which govern the rates of the critical processes act over different distance
scales, as in Turing's reaction-diffusion models. This shows that patterns
would form in the disk even in the absence of gravitational effects, density
waves, rotation, shear and external perturbations. These nonlinear effects may
thus explain the spiral structure seen in the star forming regions of isolated
flocculent galaxies.

quiescence (1990-1993) followed by two optical outbursts in 1994 and 1995. The
hot component (i.e. X-ray emitting compact object) turns out to be very
luminous during the quiescent phase: (9.5+/-1.5)*10^36 (D/2.5 kpc)^2 erg/s.
This suggests that the compact object is burning hydrogen-rich matter on its
surface even in the quiescent (as defined optically) state at a rate of
(3.2+/-0.5)*10^-8 (D/2.5 kpc)^2 M_sun/yr. Assuming a steady state, i.e. burning
at precisely the accretion supply rate, this high rate suggests a Roche lobe
filling cool companion though Bondi-Hoyle accretion from the companion wind
cannot be excluded. We have discovered a remarkable decrease of the X-ray flux
during both optical maxima. In the UV these events were characterized by a
large increase of the emission line and continuum fluxes. The anticorrelation
of X-ray/UV flux and optical brightness evolution is very likely due to a
temperature decrease of the hot component which could be the result of an
increased mass transfer to the burning compact object, causing it to slowly
expand to about twice its original size during each optical outburst.

quantum models are explored by exploiting the underlying algebraic structures
related to the Yang-Baxter equations. Physical meaning of abstract mathematical
notions like universal R-matrix, quantized algebras, Sklyanin algebra, braided
algebra, Hopf algebra etc. and the role played by them in integrable systems
are highlighted. Systematic construction of quantum integrable lattice as well
as field models and their exact excitation spectra are presented through
examples. The coordinate and algebraic formulations of the Bethe ansatz are
illustrated with comparison, along with the description of nested and
functional Bethe ansatzes. The techniques for deriving quantum Hamiltonians
from the Lax operators are demonstrated on concrete models. The exposition of
this review is kept in a fairly elementary level with emphasis on the physical
contents.

amplitudes which reflect the same dynamics, but which differ in the description
of their initial and final state vectors. In one version, the incident and
scattered states are elements of a perturbative Fock space, and solve the
eigenvalue problem for the `free' part of the Hamiltonian --- the part that
remains after the interactions between particle excitations have been `switched
off'. Alternatively, the incident and scattered states may be coherent states
that are transforms of these Fock states. In earlier work, we reported on the
scattering amplitudes for QED, in which a unitary transformation relates
perturbative and non-perturbative sets of incident and scattered states. In
this work, we generalize this earlier result to the case of transformations
that are not necessarily unitary and that may not have unique inverses. We
discuss the implication of this relationship for Abelian and non-Abelian gauge
theories in which the `transformed', non-perturbative states implement
constraints, such as Gauss's law.

every sequence $v_1, v_2, \ldots ,v_k$ of $k$ distinct vertices of $G$, there
exists a Hamiltonian cycle that encounters $v_1, v_2, \ldots , v_k$ in this
order. In this paper, answering a question of Ng and Schultz, we give a sharp
bound for the minimum degree guaranteeing that a graph is a $k$-ordered
Hamiltonian graph under some mild restrictions. More precisely, we show that
there are $\varepsilon, n_0> 0$ such that if $G$ is a graph of order $n\geq
n_0$ with minimum degree at least $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil + \lfloor
\frac{k}{2} \rfloor - 1$ and $2\leq k \leq \eps n$, then $G$ is a $k$-ordered
Hamiltonian graph. It is also shown that this bound is sharp for every $2\leq k

Regularity Lemma. The method is applied to find certain spanning subgraphs in
dense graphs. The other main general tool of the method, beside the Regularity
Lemma, is the so-called Blow-up Lemma. This lemma helps to find bounded degree
spanning subgraphs in $\varepsilon$-regular graphs. Our original proof of the
lemma is not algorithmic, it applies probabilistic methods. In this paper we
provide an algorithmic version of the Blow-up Lemma. The desired subgraph, for
an $n$-vertex graph, can be found in time $O(nM(n))$, where $M(n)=O(n^{2.376})$
is the time needed to multiply two $n$ by $n$ matrices with 0,1 entries over
the integers. We show that the algorithm can be parallelized and implemented in
$NC^5$.
