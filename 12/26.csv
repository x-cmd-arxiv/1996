b_+=1, similar to those of Kronheimer and Mrowka in the case b_+>1: We show
that for a 4-manifold with b_+=1 and two different period points F, G on the
boundary of the positive cone, the difference of the Donaldson invariants at F
and G satisfies the k^{th}-order simple type condition for a number k,
explicitely given in terms of F and G. We give a formula for this difference in
terms of a set of basic classes, expressed in a universal formula involving
modular forms. The leading terms coincide with the formulas of Kronheimer and
Mrowka in the simple type case. The basic classes are related to the Seiberg
Witten invariants. The proof of these results is based on the conjecture of
Kotschick and Morgan on the structure of the wall-crossing terms. We relate the
problem to new theta functions for indefinite lattices.

  Integral workshop "" The Transparent Universe"", Eds: C. Winkler et al. (St.

entirely due to the reprocessing of hard radiation impinging on the disk. The
hard radiation itself is emitted by a hot point source above the disk, that
could be physically realized by a strong shock terminating an aborted jet. This
hot source contains ultra-relativistic leptons scattering the disk soft photons
by Inverse Compton (IC) process. Using simple formula to describe the IC
process in an anisotropic photon field, we derive a self-consistent solution in
the Newtonian geometry, where the angular distribution of soft and hard
radiation, and the radial profile of the disk effective temperature are
determined in a univocal way. This offers an alternative picture to the
standard accretion disk emission law, reproducing individual spectra and
predicting new scaling laws that fit better the observed statistical
properties. General relativistic calculations are also carried out. It appears
that differences with the Newtonian case are weak, unless the hot source is
very close to the black hole.

By minimizing the scalar potential, we show that the supersymmetry breaking can
be communicated to the visible sector without breaking QCD color. In this model
there appear various scales. Supersymmetry breaking scale turns out to be the
intermediate scale ( \sim 10^{10} GeV ) between the GUT scale and the soft

point of single/double-arc phase transition with a discontinuity of the third
derivative of the free energy. The latter signifies a novel universality of
large-N correlators other than the usual single arc type. This phase structure
is consistent with the universality classification of two-level correlators for
multiple-arc models by Ambjorn and Akemann. We also establish the stability of
