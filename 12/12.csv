to be observed, at first as a probable detection, and later ``confirmed''. It
is important because it is the only case in which there is a serious likelihood
of a high D/H ratio, since the others are more ambiguous and admit a wide range
of D/H including zero. We present new high-resolution spectra with higher
quality than those published. Deuterium has been reported in two Lyman limit
systems (\zabs = 3.32, 2.80) along the line of sight. In both we find that the
absorption is readily explained by H alone and that deuterium absorption is
neither required nor suggested by the spectra. The three previous models with
high D/H values (D/H $\approx 20 \times 10^{-5}$) are not compatible with the
new data, and in some cases the differences are surprisingly large. Since the
spectrum is compatible with all values of D/H from zero up to large upper
limits, neither absorption system can be used to measure D/H, and previously
cited values should be disregarded. There is now no case in which a high value
of D/H has been established, and all data are compatible with low D/H.
Deuterium has been seen and measured in only two QSOs (Q1937--1009 and
Q1009+2956), both of which give low D/H. Several other QSOs give upper limits
which are about ten times less sensitive.

be predominantly inverse Compton losses experienced by the radio-emitting

resulting from a decreasing proportion of thermal electrons entrained in the

particular types of singularities that occur in the Gutzwiller-Voros zeta
function for bound chaotic systems. To understand the problem better we extend
the discussion to include various classical zeta functions and we contrast
properties of axiom-A scattering systems with those of typical bound systems.
Singularities in classical zeta functions contain topological and dynamical
information, concerning e.g. anomalous diffusion, phase transitions among
generalized Lyapunov exponents, power law decay of correlations. Singularities
in semiclassical zeta functions are artifacts and enters because one neglects
some quantum effects when deriving them, typically by making saddle point
approximation when the saddle points are not enough separated. The discussion
is exemplified by the Sinai billiard where intermittent orbits associated with
neutral orbits induce a branch point in the zeta functions. This singularity is
responsible for a diverging diffusion constant in Lorentz gases with unbounded
horizon. In the semiclassical case there is interference between neutral orbits
and intermittent orbits. The Gutzwiller-Voros zeta function exhibit a branch
point because it does not take this effect into account. Another consequence is
that individual states, high up in the spectrum, cannot be resolved by
Berry-Keating technique.

model and the Potts fluid (a system of interacting s-states spins which are
free to move in the continuum) to derive the low density expansion of the pair
connectedness and the mean cluster size. We prove that given an adequate
identification of functions, the result is equivalent to the density expansion
derived from a completely different point of view by Coniglio et al. [J. Phys A
10, 1123 (1977)] to describe physical clustering in a gas. We then apply our
expansion to a system of hypercubes with a hard core interaction. The
calculated critical density is within approximately 5% of the results of
simulations, and is thus much more precise than previous theoretical results
which were based on integral equations. We suggest that this is because
integral equations smooth out overly the partition function (i.e., they
describe predominantly its analytical part), while our method targets instead
the part which describes the phase transition (i.e., the singular part).

Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model at finite temperature. The final
effective theory is obtained after three successive stages of integration out
of massive particles. We obtain the full 1-loop relation between the couplings
of the reduced theory and the underlying 4D couplings and masses. The procedure
is also applied to a general two Higgs doublet model and the Next to Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model.
  We analyze the effective 3D theory constructed for the MSSM to determine the
regions of parameter space for which electroweak baryogenesis is possible. We
find that the inclusion of all supersymmetric scalars has the effect of
enhancing the strength of the phase transition. The requirement of a very light
stop is not necessary for baryogenesis. The phase transition is sufficiently
first order if the lightest Higgs mass, $m_{h} ~< 70$ GeV. We note the
existence of potentially interesting regions of parameter space for which
existing analysis techniques are inadequate to decide the question.

in the region of 0.8 < x < 1.5 and Q^2 < 20 GeV^2, separating the quasielastic
and inelastic plus deep inelastic contributions. The agreement with present
experimental data is good giving support to the results for both channels.
Predictions are made in yet unexplored regions of x and Q^2 to assert the
weight of the quasielastic or inelastic channels. We find that at Q^2 < 4 GeV^2
the structure function is dominated by the quasielastic contributions for x <
1.5, while for values of Q^2 > 15 GeV^2 and the range of x studied the
inelastic channels are over one order of magnitude bigger than the quasielastic
one. The potential of the structure function at x > 1 as a source of
information on nuclear correlations is stressed once more.

terms of three constituents. We investigate a collective model in which the
nucleon is regarded as a rotating and vibrating oblate top with a prescribed

single-particle descriptions of baryons and compare the predictions of the
model with existing data on masses, electromagnetic elastic and transition form
factors and strong decays widths.

  Physics","Eur. J. Phys. 18 (1997) 354-362",,,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.ed-ph quant-ph",,"  A new approach to chemical bonding is introduced in order to provide an
improved understanding of the connection between basic quantum mechanics and
the covalent pair bond. It's focus is on the fact that the energy of the bond
is largely given by the kinetic energy of the electrons, while the Coulomb
forces are only comparable to the kinetic energy terms close to the atomic
nuclei, where they define the shape and the size of the atomic orbitals. If
atomic orbitals are used as a starting point, the kinetic energy operator is
sufficient to determine the energy of the chemical bond. The simple
mathematical structure of this operator allows a calculation of bond energy as
a function of the distance between the atoms. For Gaussian wavefunctions, it is
possible to calculate this bonding potential analytically, determining the bond
length, the bond energy and the elasticity of the bond from only a single
parameter, the width of the atomic wavefunction. It is shown that the results
correspond surprisingly well with experimental values for diatomic molecules.

thermodynamic advantage, in apparent (but not actual) contradiction to the
second law of thermodynamics. Quantum-mechanical versions of Maxwell's demon
exhibit features that classical versions do not: in particular, a device that
gets information about a quantum system disturbs it in the process. In
addition, the information produced by quantum measurement acts as an additional
source of thermodynamic inefficiency. This paper investigates the properties of
quantum-mechanical Maxwell's demons, and proposes experimentally realizable
models of such devices.

  generalised quantum theory","31 pages, RevTeX",,,"Imperial/TP/95-96/63, DAMTP R96/44","quant-ph",,"  In standard quantum theory, the ideas of information-entropy and of pure
states are closely linked. States are represented by density matrices $\rho$ on
a Hilbert space and the information-entropy $-tr(\rho\log\rho)$ is minimised on
pure states (pure states are the vertices of the boundary of the convex set of
states). The space of decoherence functions in the consistent histories
approach to generalised quantum theory is also a convex set. However, by
showing that every decoherence function can be written as a convex combination
of two other decoherence functions we demonstrate that there are no `pure'
decoherence functions.
  The main content of the paper is a new notion of information-entropy in
generalised quantum mechanics which is applicable in contexts in which there is
no a priori notion of time. Information-entropy is defined first on consistent
sets and then we show that it decreases upon refinement of the consistent set.
This information-entropy suggests an intrinsic way of giving a consistent set
selection criterion.
