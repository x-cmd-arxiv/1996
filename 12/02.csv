flattening on the X-ray emission, particularly with regard to the X-ray
underluminosity of flat systems. The trend between the X-ray to optical ratio
$L_X/L_B$, a measure of the hot gas content of the galaxies, and $v_r/\sigma_0$
is L-shaped, with the X-ray brightest objects confined at $v_r/\sigma_0 <0.4$,
both for Es and S0s. Neither for low or intermediate, nor for high $L_X/L_B$,
there is any clear correlation between X-ray emission and rotational
properties. The trend between $L_X/L_B$ and the ellipticity $\epsilon$ is also
L-shaped: there are no high $L_X/L_B$ objects with high $\epsilon$. The
existence of a relation between $v_r/\sigma_0$ and $\epsilon$ makes it
difficult to assess whether rotation or flattening is at the basis of the
trends found. Our observational findings are finally discussed in connection
with the effects that rotation and flattening are predicted to have in the
cooling flow and in the wind/outflow/inflow scenarios.

cosmologies in both of these states. The energy scale of inflation is
calculated by finding a sharp probability peak in this distribution function

(the mean value of the corresponding Hubble constant $H\simeq 10^{-5}m_P$, its

physics potential of nucleus-nucleus interactions at the LHC. Being a general
purpose experiment, it will allow a comprehensive study of hadrons, electrons,
muons and photons, produced in the collision of heavy nuclei, up to the highest
particle multiplicities anticipated (dNch/dy=8000). In addition to heavy
systems (Pb-Pb), we will study collisions at smaller energy densities by using
lower-mass ions (e.g. A~40). Reference data will be obtained from pp and
p-nucleus collisions. The central part of ALICE covers $|\eta| < 0.9$, and
consists of an inner tracker (ITS), a TPC and a particle identification array
(PID), all embedded in a large magnet with a weak solenoidal field. The
experiment is completed by two small area spectrometers in the barrel region
(an electromagnetic calorimeter, PHOS, and a high momentum PID detector,
HMPID), a forward muon spectrometer (2 degrees to 9.5 degrees) and a ZDC.

Contrary to the charmed baryon sector, many channels of bottom baryon decays
proceed only through the external or internal W-emission diagrams. Moreover,
W-exchange is likely to be suppressed in the bottom baryon sector.
Consequently, the factorization approach suffices to describe most of the
Cabibbo-allowed bottom baryon decays. We use the nonrelativistic quark model to
evaluate heavy-to-heavy and heavy-to-light baryon form factors at zero recoil.
When applied to the heavy quark limit, the quark model results do satisfy all
the constraints imposed by heavy quark symmetry. The decay rates and up-down
asymmetries for bottom baryons decaying into $(1/2)^++P(V)$ and $(3/2)^++P(V)$
are calculated. It is found that the up-down asymmetry is negative except for
$\Omega_b \to (1/2)^++P(V)$ decay and for decay modes with $\psi'$ in the final
state. The prediction $B(\Lambda_b \to J/\psi\Lambda)=1.6 \times 10^{-4}$ for
$|V_{cb}|=0.038$ is consistent with the recent CDF measurement. We also present
estimates for $\Omega_c \to (3/2)^++P(V)$ decays and compare with various model

study such changes by using a chiral confining model of the nucleon. We use
density-dependent masses for all mesons except the pion. Within a
Dirac-Brueckner analysis, based on the relativistic covariant structure of the
NN amplitude, we show that the effect of such a density dependence in the NN
interaction on the saturation properties of nuclear matter, while not large, is
quite significant. Due to the density dependence of the $g_{\sigma NN}$, as
predicted by the chiral confining model, we find, in particular, a looping
behavior of the binding energy at saturation as a function of the saturation
density. A simple model is described, which exhibits looping and which is shown
to be mainly caused by the presence of a peak in the density dependence of the
medium modified $\sigma N$ coupling constant at low density.
  The effect of density dependence of the coupling constants and the meson
masses tends to improve the results for $E/A$ and density of nuclear matter at
saturation. From the present study we see that the relationship between binding
energy and saturation density may not be as universal as found in
nonrelativistic studies and that more model dependence is exhibited once medium

quasi-continuous ones. Such transformations are related with q-deformations of
the dilations of the Euclidean space and with the non-commutative space. We
work out two examples of Hamiltonian invariance under such symmetries. The
Schrodinger equation for a free particle is investigated in such a
non-commutative plane and a connection with anyonic statistics is found.

possibility of new ways of performing efficient calculations. The most striking
example is the factoring problem. It has recently been shown that computers
that exploit quantum features could factor large composite integers. This task
is believed to be out of reach of classical computers as soon as the number of
digits in the number to factor exceeds a certain limit. The additional power of
quantum computers comes from the possibility of employing a superposition of
states, of following many distinct computation paths and of producing a final
output that depends on the interference of all of them. This ``quantum
parallelism'' outstrips by far any parallelism that can be thought of in
classical computation and is responsible for the ``exponential'' speed-up of
computation.
  This is a non-technical (or at least not too technical) introduction to the
field of quantum computation. It does not cover very recent topics, such as
error-correction.
