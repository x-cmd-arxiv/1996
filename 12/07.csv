Thus cusps, black holes, and non-axisymmetry are not a sure recipe for chaos,
as is generally assumed. A new family of orbits, lens orbits, emerges to
replace the box orbits of models of elliptical galaxies that have
constant-density cores. Loop orbits are conspicuous by their absence. Both
lenses and boxlets (the other family of orbits), can be elongated in the
direction of the density distribution, a property that is favourable for the
construction of non-axisymmetric, self-consistent equilibrium models of
elliptical galaxies.

models having the Stackel form suggested by Kuz'min & Kutuzov. We have employed
the 2-integral DFs given by Dejonghe & de Zeeuw for which flattened
non-rotating models are characterized by counter-streaming motion and are
radially cool; we introduce net rotation in some models by changing the sign of
the z-component of angular momentum for a fraction of the particles. We have
found that all non-rotating and slowly rotating members of this sequence
rounder than E7 are stable, and that even maximally rotating models rounder
than E4 are stable. In the absence of strong rotation, the most disruptive
instability, and the last to be stabilized by increasing thickness, is a
lopsided (m=1) mode. This instability appears to be driven by counter-rotation
in radially cool models. Its vigour is lessened as rotation is increased, but
it remains strong even in models with net angular momentum 90% of that of a
maximally rotating model before finally disappearing in maximally rotating
models. Strongly rotating models are more unstable to bar-forming modes which
afflict maximally rotating models with c/a >~ 0.5, but this mode is quickly
stabilized by moderate fractions of counter-rotating particles. Bending
instabilities appear not to be very important; they are detectable in the inner
parts of the flatter models, but are less vigorous and more easily stabilized
than the lop-sided or bar modes in every case. We briefly discuss the possible
relevance of the lop-sided instability to the existence of many lop-sided disk
galaxies.

In this paper, we also use the Press-Schechter theory to construct a velocity
function theoretically. Model predictions are compared with the observed
velocity function and the HST snapshot survey. Comparison with the latter
observation shows that the predictions based on the theoretical velocity
function are consistent with the observed large separation events in COBE
normalized low-density models, especially with a non-vanishing cosmological
constant. Adopting the COBE normalization, however, we could find no model
which simultaneously satisfies both the observed velocity function and the HST
snapshot survey. We systematically investigate various uncertainties in the
gravitational lensing statistics including finite core radius, the distance
formula, magnification bias, and dust obscuration. The results are very
sensitive to these effects as well as theoretical models for the velocity
function, implying that current limits on the cosmological parameters should be
interpreted with caution. Predictions for future surveys are also presented.

the addition of a CP violating dimension six operator. We work in the context
of a first order phase transition, but the processes we describe can also occur
during the evolution of a network of topological defects. Both the approaches
we explore deal with circumstances where the bubble walls which convert the
high temperature phase to the low temperature phase are thin and rapidly
moving. We first consider the dynamics of localized configurations with winding
number one which remain in the broken phase immediately after the bubble wall
has passed. Their subsequent decay can anomalously produce fermions. In a
prelude to our analysis of this effect, we demonstrate how to define the C and
CP symmetries in the bosonic sector of the electroweak theory when
configurations with nonzero winding are taken into account. Second, we consider
the effect of the passage of the wall itself on configurations which happen to
be near the crest of the ridge between vacua as the wall arrives. We find that
neither of the simple approaches followed here can be pushed far enough to
obtain a convincing estimate of the BAU which is produced. A large scale

proved a number of interesting and sometimes unexpected mathematical results,
such as mirror symmetry. A careful examination of the behavior of string
propagation on (mildly) singular varieties similarly suggests a new type of
(co)homology theory. It has the `good behavior' of the well established
intersection (co)homology and $L^2$-cohomology, but is markedly different in
some aspects. For one, unlike the intersection (co)homology and the
$L^2$-cohomology (or any other known thus far), this new cohomology is
symmetric with respect to the mirror map. Among the available choices, this
makes it into a prime candidate for describing the string theory zero modes in
geometrical terms.

described by an N dimensional Hilbert space with a Hamiltonian of the form $E
|w >< w|$ where $| w>$ is an unknown (normalized) state. We show how to
discover $| w >$ by adding a Hamiltonian (independent of $| w >$) and evolving
for a time proportional to $N^{1/2}/E$. We show that this time is optimally
short. This process is an analog analogue to Grover's algorithm, a computation
on a conventional (!) quantum computer which locates a marked item from an
unsorted list of N items in a number of steps proportional to $N^{1/2}$.
