anticommuting integrable almost complex structures. For example, every
hyperkaehler manifold is canonically hypercomplex (the converse is not true).
For every hypercomplex manifold M, the two almost complex structures define a
smooth action of the algebra of quaternions on the tangent bundle to M. This
allows to associate to every hypercomplex manifold M of dimension 4n a certain
almost complex manifold X of dimension 4n+2, called the twistor space of M.
When M is hyperkaehler, X is well-known to be integrable. We show that for an
arbitrary hypercomplex manifold its twistor space is also integrable.

EGRET source, the lensed AGN PKS 1830-210 near the direction of the Galactic
center. We provide the best available positions for 16 more radio sources which
are also potential identifications for previously unidentified EGRET sources.
All high Galactic latitude EGRET sources (b>3 degrees) which demonstrate
significant variability can be identified with flat spectrum radio sources.
This suggests that EGRET is not detecting any type of AGN other than blazars.
This identification method has been used to establish with 99.998% confidence
that the peak gamma-ray flux of a blazar is correlated with its average 5 GHz
radio flux. An even better correlation is seen between gamma-ray flux and the
2.29 GHz flux density measured with VLBI at the base of the radio jet. Also,
using high confidence identifications, we find that the radio sources

orbit with a massive main sequence B-star companion, indicate that the system's
orbital period is decreasing on a timescale $\sim 5 x 10^{5}$ years (Kaspi et
al. 1996). Timing observations of PSR J0045-7319 also indicate that the B-star
is rotating rapidly, perhaps close to its breakup rotation rate. For rapid
(super-synchronous) prograde rotation of the B-star, tidal dissipation leads to
an increasing orbital period for the binary system, while for retrograde
rotation of any magnitude, the orbital period decreases with time. We show that
if tidal effects are to account for the observed orbital decay of the PSR
J0045-7319 binary, the B-star must have retrograde rotation. This implies that
the supernova that produced the pulsar in this binary system likely had a
dipole anisotropy.
  For a reasonably wide range of retrograde rotation rates, the energy in the
dynamical tide of the B-star needs to be dissipated in about one orbital period
in order to account for the observed orbital evolution time for the PSR
J0045-7319 binary. We show, however, that the radiative dissipation of the
dynamical tide in a rigidly rotating B-star is too inefficient by a factor of
$\approx$ 10$^3$, regardless of the magnitude of the rotation rate. We describe
how, when the surface of the B-star is rotating nearly synchronously (which is
expected from the work of Goldreich and Nicholson, 1989), the energy in the
dynamical tide is dissipated in less than an orbital period, thus reconciling
the theoretical and observed rates of orbital evolution.

in high T_c superconductors is discussed within a scenario of a mixture of
localized tightly bound electron pairs in singlet states (bi-polarons) and
itinerant electrons. Due to a local exchange between the two species of charge
carriers, antiferromagnetic correlations are induced amongst the itinerant
electrons in the vicinity of the sites containing the bound electron pairs. As
the temperature is lowered these exchange processes become spatially correlated
leading to a spin wave-like spectrum in the subsystem of the itinerant
electrons. The onset of such coherence is accompanied by the opening of a
pseudo gap in the density of states of the electron subsystem whose temperature
dependence is reflected in that of $\chi'' (q,\omega)$ near $q =(\pi,\pi)$
where a ``spin gap'' is observed by inelastic neutron scattering and NMR.

  the End of the 20th Century'' CARRUTHERS61",,,,"hep-ph",,"  In addition to its importance in describing high-energy processes themselves,
the dynamics of multiparticle production is part of the general field of
non-linear phenomena and complex systems. Multiparticle dynamics is one of the
rare fields of physics where higher-order correlations are directly accessible
in their full multi-dimensional characteristics under well-controlled
experimental conditions. Multiparticle dynamics, therefore, is an ideal testing
ground for the development of advanced statistical methods. Higher-order
correlations have, indeed, been observed as particle-density fluctuations.
Approximate scaling with finer resolution provides evidence for a self-similar
correlation effect. Quantum-Chromodynamics branching is a good candidate for a
dynamical explanation of these correlations in e+e- collisions at CERN/LEP and,
as expected, also of those in pp collisions at future CERN/LHC energies.
However, other sources such as identical-particle Bose-Einstein interference
effects also contribute. A particular question at the moment is the smooth
transition from the QCD branching domain (gluon interference before
hadronization) to the Bose-Einstein domain (identical-pion interference after
hadronization). Both mechanisms have clearly been observed in e+e- collisions
at CERN/LEP energies. The large amount of high-resolution data being collected
at LEP will allow the study of the genuine (i.e. non-trivial) higher-order
correlations in both domains.

developing the string theory classical instability due to the effect of sigma
model instantons. We argue that string theory allows for a qualitative
description of black holes with very small masses and it predicts topological
solitons with quantized spectrum of masses. These solitons would not decay into
string massless excitations but could be pair created and may annihilate also.
Semiclassical mass quantization of topological solitons in string theory is

"math/9612203","Eric Bedford","Eric Bedford and John Smillie","Polynomial Diffeomorphisms of C^2: VI. Connectivity of J",,,,"Dynamical Systems 12/18/96","math.CV math.DS",,"  Given a polynomial diffeomorphism f: C^2 -> C^2 there is a set
$J_f\subset{\bf C}^2$ which we call the Julia set of f. The set $J_f\subset
C^2$ plays the role of the Julia set $J\subset{\bf C}$ for a polynomial map of
C. In the study of polynomial maps of C a great deal of attention has been paid
to the connectivity of the Julia set. The focus of this paper is to investigate
the J-connected/J-disconnected dichotomy in the case of polynomial
diffeomorphisms of C^2.
  The Jacobian determinant of f is constant. We make the standing assumption
that $|det\ Df|\le 1$ (this can always be achieved by replacing f by $f^{-1}$
if necessary). The set $J^-$ is the set of points with bounded backward orbits.
The set $U^+$ is the set of points with unbounded forward orbits. Let p be a
periodic saddle point and let $W^u(p)$ be its unstable manifold. The set
$W^u(p)$ will be a Riemann surface conformally equivalent to C.
  Theorem 1. The following are equivalent:
  1. For some periodic saddle point p, some component of $W^u(p)\cap U^+$ is
simply connected.
  2. The set $J^-\cap U^+$ has a lamination by simply connected leaves so that
for any periodic saddle point p each component of $W^u(p)\cap U^+$ is a leaf of
this lamination.
  3. For any periodic saddle point p, each component of $W^u(p)\cap U^+$ is
simply connected.
  If f satisfies one of these conditions we say that f is unstably connected.
  Theorem 2. The set J is connected if and only if f is unstably connected.
  These results imply that we can determine the connectivity of J by
considering the forward orbits of points in a single unstable manifold. These
results open the door to computer exploration of the topology of two
dimensional Julia sets and the connectivity locus in the parameter space.

time evolution of various quark flavours in the central region of
ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The effects of thermal masses for
quarks and gluons are incorporated to take into account the in-medium
properties of these ingredients of the putative quark gluon plasma. We find
that even under very optimistic conditions, complete chemical equilibration in
the quark gluon plasma appears unlikely.

  Singapore",,,"nucl-th",,"  The initial production and dynamical expansion of hot spherical nuclei are
examined as the first stage both in the projectile-multifragmentation and in
central collision processes. The initial temperatures, which are necessary for
entering the adiabatic spinodal region, as well as the minimum temperatures and
densities, which are reached in the expansion, significantly differ for hard
and soft equations of state. Additional initial compression, occurring in
central collisions leads most likely to a qualitatively different
multifragmentation mechanism. Recent experimental data are discussed in
relation to the results of the proposed model.

exact inclusion of the final state interaction among the three emerging
protons. The absorption is described by a $\pi N \to \Delta$ vertex and a
$N\Delta - NN$ transition t-matrix which are calculated from a phenomenological
model for NN and \pi d reactions. In a calculation where the initial pion
scattering effects are neglected, the predicted peaks of the pion absorption
cross sections for ^2H and ^3He lie too high in energy in relation to the data.
The effect of the final state three-nucleon interaction turns out to be too
small for changing the magnitude and shifting the peak position of the total
absorption cross section for ^3He. We demonstrate that the adjustment of the
peak position for the deuteron cross section by small modifications of the
$\Delta$-parameters, automatically leads to the correct peak position in ^3He.

preserve the simplest scalar and vector-valued polynomial modules in two
variables have a fundamental Lie algebraic structure. Our approach is based on
a general graphical method which does not require the modules to be irreducible
under the action of the corresponding Lie (super)algebra. This method can be
generalized to modules of polynomials in an arbitrary number of variables. We
give generic examples of partially solvable differential operators which are
not Lie algebraic. We show that certain vector-valued modules give rise to new
realizations of finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras by first-order
differential operators.

complex parameter h, defines a triplet $({\hat X},{\hat Y},{\hat H})$. The
latter set forms a closed algebra under commutation relations. The nonlinear
algebra $U_{q,h}(sl(2))$, thus generated, has two different limits. For $q \to
1$, the Jordanian h-deformation $U_{h}(sl(2))$ is obtained. For $h \to 0$, the
q-deformed algebra $U_{q}(sl(2))$ is reproduced. From the nonlinear map, the
irreducible representations of the doubly-deformed algebra $U_{q,h}(sl(2))$ may
be directly and explicitly obtained form the known representations of the
algebra $U_q(sl(2))$. Here we consider only generic values of q.
