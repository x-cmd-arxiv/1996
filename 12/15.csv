  figures, a more careful and digested, major rewrite of previous version",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements over a large range of
angular scales have become sensitive enough to provide interesting constraints
on cosmological parameters within a restricted class of models. We use the CMB
measurements to study inflation-based, cold dark matter (CDM) critical density
universes. We explore the 4-dimensional parameter space having as free
parameters, Hubble's constant Ho, baryonic fraction Omega_b, the spectral slope
of scalar perturbations n and the power spectrum quadrupole normalization Q. We
calculate chi-squared minimization values and likelihood intervals for these
parameters. Within the models considered, a low value for the Hubble constant
is preferred: Ho= 30^{+18}_{-7} km/s/Mpc. The baryonic fraction is not as
well-constrained by the CMB data: Omega_b = 0.07^{+ 0.24}_{-0.07}. The power
spectrum slope is n=0.91^{+0.20}_{-0.12}. The power spectrum normalization is
Q=18 +/- 2.5 uK. The error bars on each parameter are approximately 1 sigma and
are for the case where the other 3 parameters have been marginalized. If we
condition on n=1 we obtain the normalization Q = 17 +/- 1.0 uK. The permitted
regions of the 4-D parameter space are presented in a series of 2-D
projections. In the context of the CDM critical density universes considered
here, current CMB data favor a low value for the Hubble constant. Such low-Ho
models are consistent with Big Bang nucleosynthesis, cluster baryonic
fractions, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and the ages of globular
clusters; although in disagreement with direct determinations of the Hubble
constant.

For f=1/3 this binding energy is positive, resulting in a linear critical
interface. In order to make a comparison to recent experiments, we investigate
the effect of small quenched bond disorder for f=2/5. A finite-size scaling
analysis of extensive Monte Carlo simulations strongly suggests that the

investigated. It is found that spherical membranes ( in the lightcone gauge)
moving in flat target spacetime backgrounds admit a class of integrable
solutions linked to $SU(\infty)$ SDYM equations ( dimensionally reduced to one
temporal dimension) which, in turn, are related to Plebanski 4D SD
Gravitational equations. A further rotational Killing-symmetry reduction yields
the 3D continuous Toda theory. It is precisely the latter which bears a direct
relationship to non critical $W_\infty$ string theory. The expected critical
dimensions for the ( super) membrane , (D=11) and D=27, are easily obtained.
This suggests that this particular sector of the membrane's spectrum (connected
to the $SU(\infty)$ SDYM equations ) bears a direct connection to a critical
$W_\infty$ string spectrum adjoined to a q=N+1 unitary minimal model of the W_N
algebra in the $N\rightarrow \infty$ limit. Final comments are made about the
connection to Jevicki's observation that the 4D quantum membrane is linked to
