peculiar velocities is presented. The formalism is applied to (1) the Mark III
catalogue, (2) Lauer and Postman's Abell cluster catalogue, and (3) Riess et
al.'s Type Ia supernova sample. The emphasis is drawn to the monopolar peculiar
velocities, i.e., peculiar Hubble flows, within these samples. The samples show
inconsistent peculiar Hubble flows within a depth of $\sim 60h^{-1}$ Mpc.
Beyond a depth of $\sim 80h^{-1}$ Mpc, the Hubble flows of all samples converge
to the global Hubble flow to better than 10% at the $2\sigma$ level. The
results are compared with theoretical predictions. They at face value disfavor
models predicting smaller peculiar velocities such as the tilted Cold Dark
Matter model. Limitations of the catalogues are discussed, so are ways to
improve the catalogues so that an accurate map of Hubble flows in our local
universe can be drawn and be compared with theoretical predictions.

0.08$ around the Solar-type star 16 Cyg B, together with earlier discoveries of
other planets in orbits of significant eccentricity, raises the question of the
origin of these orbits, so unlike the nearly circular orbits of our Solar
system. In this paper I consider close encounters between two planets, each
initially in a nearly circular orbit (but with sufficient eccentricity to
permit the encounter). Such encounters are described by a two-body
approximation, in which the effect of the attracting star is neglected, and by
the approximation that their separation vector follows a nearly parabolic path.
A single encounter cannot produce the present state of these systems, in which
one planet is in an eccentric orbit and the other has apparently been lost.
Even if the requirement that the second planet be lost is dropped, nearly
circular orbits cannot scatter into eccentric ones.

least two connected components $U_a^1$ and $U_a^2$.

an event $b\in U_a^2$, and join the boundaries of formed two holes by means of
4-dimensional cylinder. As result we have a four-dimensional wormhole C, which
is a Time machine if b belongs to the past of event a. The past of a is lying
arbitrarily nearly. The distant Past is more accessible than the near Past. It
seems that real global space-time V^4 is a resilient one, i.e. is a resilient

Some motivation for this scenario is first presented. We then use a systematic,
analytic expansion (including some threshold corrections) to calculate the
$\mu$ parameter needed for proper electroweak breaking and the radiative
corrections to the B parameter, which fortuitously cancel at leading order. If
B = 0 at the messenger scale then $tan\beta$ is naturally large and calculable;
we calculate it. We then confront this prediction with classical and quantum
vacuum stability constraints arising from the Higgs-slepton potential, and
indicate the preferred values of the top quark mass and messenger scale(s). The
possibility of vacuum instability in a different direction yields an upper
bound on the messenger mass scale complementary to the familiar bound from
gravitino relic abundance. Next, we calculate the rate for $b\to s\gamma$ and
show the possibility of large deviations (in the direction currently favored by
experiment) from standard-model and small $tan\beta$ predictions. Finally, we
discuss the implications of these findings and their applicability to future,
broader and more detailed investigations.
