on the temperature-density relation of the intergalactic medium in the low
density limit (overdensity less than 5). It is applied to the study of
photo-reionization models in which the amplitude, spectrum and onset epoch of
the ionizing flux, as well as the cosmology, are systematically varied. We find
that the mean temperature-density relation at z=2-4 is well approximated by a
power-law equation of state for uniform reionization models. We derive
analytical expressions for its evolution and exhibit its asymptotic behavior:
it is found that for sufficiently early reionization, imprints of reionization
history prior to z=10 on the temperature-density relation are washed out. In
this limit the temperature at cosmic mean density is proportional to (\Omega_b
h/\sqrt\Omega_0)^{1/1.7}. While the amplitude of the radiation flux at the
ionizing frequency of HI is found to have a negligible effect on the
temperature-density relation as long as the universe reionizes before z=5, the
spectrum can change the overall temperature by about 20%, through variations in
the abundances of helium species. However the slope of the mean equation of
state is found to lie within a narrow range for all reionization models we
study, where reionization takes place before z=5. We discuss the implications
of these findings for the observational properties of the Lyman-alpha forest.
In particular, uncertainties in the temperature of the intergalactic medium,
due to the uncertain reionization history of our universe, introduces a 30%
scaling in the amplitude of the column density distribution while the the slope
of the distribution is only affected by about 5%. Finally, we discuss how a
fluctuating ionizing field affects the above results. We argue that under

Australia Telescope Compact Array. At 1.4, 2.4, 4.8 and 8.6 GHz, the flux
density of the radio remnant has increased monotonically since emission was
redetected 1200 days after the explosion. On day 3200, the remnant was
expanding at 2800 +/- 400 km/s, which we interpret as indicating significant
deceleration of the fastest moving ejecta. Since day 1787 the spectral index
has remained constant at alpha = -0.95 +/- 0.04. These observations are all
consistent with the shock having encountered a denser, shocked, component of
the progenitor's stellar wind. At the current rate of expansion, the shock is
expected to encounter the inner optical ring in the year 2006 +/- 3.
  Using super-resolution, we have also obtained 9 GHz images of the remnant
(resolution approx 0"".5) at four epochs. The emission is distributed around the
rim of a near-circular shell, but has become increasingly asymmetric with time.
There are two ""hotspots"" to the east and west, aligned along the major axis of
the optical ring. This morphology is most likely indicative of an axisymmetric
circumstellar medium into which the shock is expanding, consistent with present
understanding of the progenitor star and its environment.

Addition of salt is treated implicitly through a screened Coulomb potential for
the electrostatic interactions.
  For the flexible model the electrostatic persistence length shows roughly
three regimes in its dependence on the Debye-H\""{u}ckel screening length,
$\kappa^{-1}$.As long as the salt content is low and $\kappa^{-1}$ is longer
than the end-to-end distance, the electrostatic persistence length varies only
slowly with $\kappa^{-1}$. Decreasing the screening length, a controversial
region is entered. We find that the electrostatic persistence length scales as
$sqrt{\xi_p}/\kappa$, in agreement with experiment on flexible
polyelectrolytes, where $\xi_p$ is a strength parameter measuring the
electrostatic interactions within the polyelectrolyte. For screening lengths
much shorter than the bond length, the $\kappa^{-1}$ dependence becomes
quadratic in the variational calculation. The simulations suffer from numerical
problems in this regime, but seem to give a relationship half-way between
linear and quadratic.
  A low temperature expansion only reproduces the first regime and a high
temperature expansion, which treats the electrostatic interactions as a
perturbation to a Gaussian chain, gives a quadratic dependence on the Debye
length.
  For a sufficiently stiff chain, the persistence length varies quadratically
with $\kappa^{-1}$ in agreement with earlier theories.

neutrino oscillation experiments, the amplitude of neutrino oscillation of the
``one mass scale dominance''framework vanishes for certain values of mixing
angles as a result of opposite signs of two equal and opposite contributions.
Recent astronomical observations leave open the possibility that one of the

oscillation phenomenology with a superposition of two relativistic, and one
non-relativistic, mass eigenstates is constructed. It is concluded that if the

isomonodromic deformation equations. Through examples, it is shown how
operators belonging to rank one bispectral algebras may be viewed equivalently
as defining 1-parameter families of rational first order differential operators
with matricial coefficients on the Riemann sphere, whose monodromy is trivial.
By interchanging the r\^oles of the two variables entering in the bispectral
pair, a second 1-parameter family of operators with trivial monodromy is
obtained, which may be viewed as the dual isomonodromic deformation system.
