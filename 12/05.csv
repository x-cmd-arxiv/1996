electron population, via, respectively, the synchrotron process and the inverse
Compton mechanism. We suggest that a key parameter for understanding the
overall energy distributions of both classes of objects is the energy at which
the synchrotron emission peaks in a $\nu-\nu F(\nu)$ representation.

Ia, but the shape of the spectra (i.e. the colors) are opposite to that of the

relatively cool temperatures, and could be used to determine whether large
amounts of gas are really cooling out of the X-ray band (below 10e6 K). By
comparing the fluxes of many X-ray lines, we could determine the amounts of gas
at different temperatures and densities. This would allow one to test the idea
that cooling flows are highly inhomogeneous, as required to explain their
surface brightness profiles. High resolution X-ray spectra can be used to
determine velocities in the hot gas in cooling flows. If the gas is
homogeneous, significant inflow velocities are expected. However, if the gas is
as inhomogeneous as we currently believe, the inflow velocities are likely to
be rather low (v < 30 km/s). Most of the central galaxies in cooling flows host
radio sources, and it appears that the radio lobes are expanding against,
displacing, and compressing the cooling X-ray gas. Significant motions
associated with the expansion of radio sources should be detectable in X-ray
lines. If the cooling X-ray gas rotates and viscosity is not important,
rotational motions may also be detectable in X-ray line spectra.

propagating into a fully ionized medium of uniform density on a scale
representative of the narrow line region (NLR) in Seyfert galaxies with
associated radio jets. In this regime the cooling distance of the swept up gas
in the bowshock of the jet is of the same order as the transverse extent of the
jet bowshock, as opposed to the more extreme regimes found for more powerful
adiabatic large scale jets or the slow galactic jets which have been simulated
previously. We calculate the emissivity for the H_alpha line and radio
synchrotron emission. We find that the structure of the line emitting cold
envelope of the jet cocoon is strongly dependent on the non-stationary dynamics
of the jet head as it propagates through the ambient medium. We observe the
formation of cloud-like high density regions which we associate with NLR clouds
and filaments. We find that some of these clouds might be partially neutral and
represent sites of jet induced star formation. The calculated H_alpha flux and
the spectral line width are consistent with NLR observations. The simulation of
the radio-optical emission with radiative cooling confirms the basic result of
the geometric bowshock model developed by Taylor et al. (1989) that the start
of noticeable optical line emission can be significantly offset from the
hotspot of the radio emission. However, the time-dependent nature of the jet
dynamics implies significant differences from their geometric bowshock model.

soft X-ray provides the only direct evidence for a major repository for the
cooled gas. Unfortunately, the frequency of occurrence of large excess columns
is uncertain. There is also great uncertainty about the physical state of the
material producing the absorption. Radio observations have ruled out most forms
of cold gas. Recent radio observations show that the plasma in cooling flows is
strong magnetized. Models for cooling flows including the dynamical effects of
the magnetic field are needed. We also need to understand what ultimately
happens to the advected magnetic flux. At present, it appears most likely that
the field is by field line reconnection. The radio sources associated with the
central galaxies in cluster cooling flows seem to come in two varieties. There
are ``lobe-dominated sources'' with strong radio jets and well-defined radio
lobes, and ``amorphous'' sources without strong jets or lobes. In the
lobe-dominated sources, the radio pressures agree approximately with the
pressures of the X-ray emitting thermal gas, the X-ray and radio images
anticorrelate, and the radio sources are highly polarized and have very large
Faraday rotations. In the amorphous sources, the radio pressures are much
smaller than the X-ray pressures, the X-ray and radio images correlate, and the
radio sources are strongly depolarized. These results suggest that the lobes in
the lobe-dominated sources have displaced the X-ray emitting gas, while in the
amorphous sources, the radio and thermal plasma are mixed.

the inferred masses of hot gas are consistent with those expected given the
present rates of stellar mass loss. The required rates of heating of the gas
are also roughly consistent with those expected from the motions of gas losing
stars. X-ray observations, particularly X-ray spectra, require a low rate of
Type Ia supernova heating and chemical enrichment in the gas. In the brightest
X-ray galaxies, the cooling times in the gas are short, which suggests that the
gas forms steady-state cooling flows. Steady cooling models explain most of the
properties of the brighter X-ray galaxies, including their luminosities, the
X-ray--optical correlation, their temperatures, and their surface brightness
profiles. Although the optical and X-ray luminosities of early-type galaxies
are strongly correlated, there is a large dispersion in this correlation. The
origin of the emission in the X-ray faint ellipticals is less certain. All
ellipticals appear to have a hard X-ray spectral component due to accreting
binary systems. X-ray faint ellipticals also have a very soft X-ray component,
which may be residual hot interstellar gas. The X-ray spectra of ellipticals
indicate that the abundance of iron is well below the solar value, which
implies that the rate of Type Ia supernova contamination is small. The
abundances and evidence for gradient gradients suggest that stellar abundance

understanding of B decays. The emphasis here is on applications of QCD using
perturbative and non-perturbative techniques. In some cases, however,
phenomenological models must at present be invoked to make meaningful
comparison with data. The resulting picture is consistent with the standard
model (SM) and this agreement is quantified in terms of the branching ratios,
mixing probabilities, and lifetimes which measure the charge current and
effective flavour changing neutral current transitions involving B hadrons.
This, in turn, enables a determination of five of the nine elements of the
quark mixing matrix. We discuss several proposals on improving the precision on
the parameters of this matrix in forthcoming experiments. Issues intimately
related to the quark mixing matrix such as the profile of the unitarity
triangle and CP-violating asymmetries in B decays are discussed. In particular,
we emphasize the role of rare B decays and B^0 - $\overline{B^0}$ mixings in
testing the SM quantitatively and in searching for physics beyond the SM.

can generate superpotential for $N_f=N_c-1$ as well as lead to quantum
corrections to the moduli space for $N_f=N_c$. Finally we argue that Seiberg's

parity in molecular physics. Theory indicates that these doubles can occur in
molecules that are reflection-asymmetric. Such parity doubles occur in nuclear
physics as well, among nuclei with odd A $\sim$ 219-229. We have also suggested
elsewhere that such doubles occur in particle physics for baryons made up of
`cbu' and `cbd' quarks. In this article, we discuss the theoretical foundations
of these doubles in detail, demonstrating their emergence as a surprisingly
subtle consequence of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and emphasizing their
bundle-theoretic and topological underpinnings. Starting with certain ``low
energy'' effective theories in which classical symmetries like parity and time
reversal are anomalously broken on quantization, we show how these symmetries
can be restored by judicious inclusion of ``high-energy'' degrees of freedom.
This mechanism of restoring the symmetry naturally leads to the aforementioned
doublet structure. A novel by-product of this mechanism is the emergence of an
approximate symmetry (corresponding to the approximate degeneracy of the
doubles) at low energies which is not evident in the full Hamiltonian. We also
discuss the implications of this mechanism for Skyrmion physics, monopoles,
anomalies and quantum gravity.

any satisfactory causal theory for particles of integer spin. In this paper, it
is shown that the quantal behaviour is the result of
direct-particle-interaction of the particle with all of its possibilities. The
formulation is, then, extended to the relativistic particles of arbitrary spin.
The presented theory has the following advantages. (1) It leads to a deeper
understanding of the quantal behaviour. (2) It has no superluminal motion. (3)
It is applicable to any spin. (4) It provides a framework for understanding the
problem of creation and annihilation of particles. (5) It provides a framework
for understanding the spin-statistics relationship. (6) It does not need the
two fundamental assumptions of the de-Broglie-Bohm quantum theory of motion,
i.e., the guiding-formula postulate and the statistical postulate.
