were found between the two observations. The total spectrum shows a red
continuum, $f_\nu \sim \nu^{-1.89}$, with an observed flux of $\rm 2.2 \times
10^{-14}~erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~\AA^{-1}$ at 1450 A, slightly above the historical
mean. Intrinsic absorption in Lyman $\beta$ is visible as well as absorption
from O~vi 1032,1038, N~v 1239,1243, Si~iv 1394,1403, and C~iv 1548,1551. The UV
absorption lines are far weaker than is usual for NGC~3516, and also lie closer
to the emission line redshift rather than showing the blueshift typical of
these lines when they are strong. The neutral hydrogen absorption, however, is
blueshifted by $400~\rm km~s^{-1}$ relative to the systemic velocity, and it is
opaque at the Lyman limit. The sharpness of the cutoff indicates a low
effective Doppler parameter, $b < \rm 20~km~s^{-1}$. For $b = \rm 10~km~s^{-1}$
the derived intrinsic column is $\rm 3.5 \times 10^{17}~cm^{-2}$. As in

the peculiar giant elliptical galaxy NGC 1316. The inner profile is well fit by
a nonisothermal core model with a core radius of 0.41"" +/- 0.02"" (34 pc). At an
assumed distance of 16.9 Mpc, the deprojected luminosity density reaches $\sim
2.0 \times 10^3 L_{\sun}$ pc$^{-3}$.
  Outside the inner two or three arcseconds, a constant mass-to-light ratio of
$\sim 2.2 \pm 0.2$ is found to fit the observed line width measurements. The
line width measurements of the center indicate the existence of either a
central dark object of mass $2 \times 10^9 M_{\sun}$, an increase in the
stellar mass-to-light ratio by at least a factor of two for the inner few
arcseconds, or perhaps increasing radial orbit anisotropy towards the center.
The mass-to-light ratio run in the center of NGC 1316 resembles that of many
other giant ellipticals, some of which are known from other evidence to harbor
central massive dark objects (MDO's).
  We also examine twenty globular clusters associated with NGC 1316 and report
their brightnesses, colors, and limits on tidal radii. The brightest cluster
has a luminosity of $9.9 \times 10^6 L_{\sun}$ ($M_V = -12.7$), and the
faintest detectable cluster has a luminosity of $2.4 \times 10^5 L_{\sun}$

radii are too small to be measured. The tidal radii in this region appear to be

of energy index 0.78. The low energy absorbing column is significantly less
than previously seen. Prominent O~vii and O~viii absorption edges are visible,
but, consistent with the much lower total absorbing column, no Fe K absorption
edge is detectable. A weak, narrow Fe~K$\alpha$ emission line from cold
material is present as well as a broad Fe~K$\alpha$ line. These features are
similar to those reported in other Seyfert 1 galaxies. A single warm absorber
model provides only an imperfect description of the low energy absorption. In
addition to a highly ionized absorber with ionization parameter $U = 1.66$ and
a total column density of $1.4 \times 10^{22}~\rm cm^{-2}$, adding a lower
ionization absorber with $U = 0.32$ and a total column of $6.9 \times

resonant line scattering to our warm absorber models limits the Doppler
parameter to $< 160~\rm km~s^{-1}$ at 90\% confidence. Turbulence at the sound
speed of the photoionized gas provides the best fit. None of the warm absorber
models fit to the X-ray spectrum can match the observed equivalent widths of
all the UV absorption lines. Accounting for the X-ray and UV absorption
simultaneously requires an absorbing region with a broad range of ionization
parameters and column densities.

luminosity function (Jimenez \& Padoan 1996). We show that the luminosity
function depends on both age and distance modulus and that it is possible to
distinguish between the two. This method provides at the same time independent
determinations of distance and age of a GC by simply counting the number of
stars found inside specified luminosity bins. The main uncertainties in other
traditional methods for determining GCs ages are absent (e.g. mixing length,
color-$T_{\rm eff}$ calibration, morphology of the color-magnitude diagram ).
  The distance modulus is the biggest uncertainty in determining the age of
GCs. Here we show that the age can be determined with small uncertainty for any
value of distance modulus using the LF and that the LF allows a determination
of the distance modulus itself. This is explained by the fact that the
luminosity function is affected by a change in distance-modulus in a way that
is different from its time evolution.
  If GC stellar counts with statistical errors not larger than $3\%$ are
available, the age can be determined with an uncertainty of about 0.4 Gyr
(independent of distance modulus, mixing length and color calibration) and the
distance modulus with an uncertainty of about 0.04 mag.

1400--1900 Ang and show that the morphologies of the z>3 galaxies are generally
compact, although we find a few cases of more diffuse light profiles and
objects comprised of multiple compact structures. Overall, the dispersion of
morphologies is relatively narrow, in contrast to the variety found in
star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z~1). The galaxies with
compact morphology are typically characterized by a small but resolved
``core'', approximately <0.7 arcsec in radius, or about 5 h_50 (8.5 h_50) kpc
with q_0=0.5 (0.05), and half-light radii of 0.2--0.3 arcsec, or 1.4--2.1 h_50

present-day bulges or intermediate-luminosity spheroids. The ``cores'' are
often surrounded by lower surface-brightness nebulosities, generally
asymmetrically distributed. The minority of more diffuse galaxies do not
possess this core, and an exponential function provides a very good fit to

disordered electron systems subject to strong magnetic fields, is analyzed
numerically in the light of the random matrix theory. The energy dependences of
the effective level repulsion parameter, the two level correlation, the GUE-GOE
crossover parameter, and the rigidity (or $\Delta_3$-statistics) of the level
distributions are investigated for different system sizes by unfolding the
original data and by dividing the unfolded spectrum into small regions. It is
shown that the critical exponent of the localization length as a function of
energy can be determined through the energy dependence of the level statistics.
The analyses are carried out not only for the lowest Landau band (LB) but also
for the second lowest LB. Furthermore the effect of finite range of disordered
potential is studied. The short-ranged potential case in the second lowest LB
is found to be pathological as in other studies of critical behavior, and it is
confirmed that this pathological behavior is improved in the case of disordered
potential with finite ranges.

Kalkreuter's lattice analysis of the spectrum of the massive (hermitean) Dirac

equation in the quenched approximation. The quenched spectrum shows a
Mott-transition from a (delocalized) Goldstone phase softly broken by the
current mass, to a (localized) heavy quark phase, with quarks localized over
their Compton wavelength. Both phases are distinguishable by the quark density
of states at zero virtuality, with a critical quark mass of the order of
100-200 MeV. At the critical point, the quark density of states is given by
$\nu_Q (\lambda) \sim |\lambda|^{1/3}$. Using Grassmannian techniques, we
derive an integral representation for the resolvent of the massive Dirac
operator with one-flavor in the unquenched approximation, and show that near
zero virtuality, the distribution of eigenvalues is quantitatively changed by a
non-zero quark mass. The generalization of our construction to arbitrary
flavors is also discussed. Some recommendations for lattice simulations are
suggested.

general conjecture of de Vos and van Driel relating the multiplicities of
W-algebra irreducible modules to the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of a certain
double coset. Granting this conjecture, the singular-vector argument provides a
direct way of recovering all known integrable perturbations. However, W models
bring a slight complication in that the conserved densities of some (1,2)-type

N=2,4,8 theories is found to be universal: in d=4 it is always given by the
square of the largest of the central charges extremized in the moduli space.
The proof of universality is based on the fact that the doubling of unbroken
supersymmetry near the black hole horizon requires that all central charges
other than Z=M vanish at the attractor point for N=4,8. The ADM mass at the
extremum can be computed in terms of duality symmetric quartic invariants which
are moduli independent. The extension of these results for d=5, N=1,2,4 is also
reported. A duality symmetric expression for the energy of the ground state
with spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry is provided by the power 1/2 (2/3)
of the black hole area of the horizon in d=4 (d=5). It is suggested that the

limit the Lagrangian of 2+1 dimensional pseudo-euclidean topologically massive
electrodynamics has indeed the same form of the Lagrangian of the damped
harmonic oscillator. On the hyperbolic plane a set of two damped harmonic
oscillators, each other time-reversed, is shown to be equivalent to a single
undamped harmonic oscillator. The equations for the damped oscillators are
proven to be the same as the ones for the Lorentz force acting on two particles
carrying opposite charge in a constant magnetic field and in the electric
harmonic potential. This provides an immediate link with Chern-Simons-like
dynamics of Bloch electrons in solids propagating along the lattice plane with
hyperbolic energy surface. The symplectic structure of the reduced theory is
finally discussed in the Dirac constrained canonical formalism.

required by the string/fivebrane duality conjecture. As a consequence the
worldvolume anomaly vanishes if the heterotic fields consist of 16 (rather than
32) complex Weyl fermions on the worldvolume. This implies that the
string/fivebrane duality conjecture can not be based on a ``heterotic""
super--fivebrane sigma--model with only fermions in the heterotic sector.

the Higgs field naturally appears in the theory as a particular `gauge boson',
connected to the discrete internal space, and its quartic potential, fixed by
the model, is not vanishing only when more than one fermion generation is
present. Moreover, the exact hypercharge assignments and relations among the
masses of particles have been obtained. This paper analyzes the possibility of
extensions of this model to larger unified gauge groups. Noncommutative
geometry imposes very stringent constraints on the possible theories, and
remarkably, the analysis seems to suggest that no larger gauge groups are
compatible with the noncommutative structure, unless one enlarges the fermionic
degrees of freedom, namely the number of particles.

the phase transition is constructed. In order to reproduce the lowering of the

{nucleons} rather than constituent quarks in negative energy states, down to a

significant dependence of the final state interactions on the missing energy is
found, which is important for interpretation of forthcoming color transparency
experiments. A new, more stringent kinematic restriction on the region where
the contribution of short-range nucleon correlations is enhanced in
semi-exclusive knock-out processes is derived. It is also demonstrated that the
use of light-cone variables leads to a considerable simplification of the
