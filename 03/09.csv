To appear in Ap.J","Astrophys.J.468:269,1996","10.1086/177689","POP-651","astro-ph",,"  The structure of stationary photodissociation fronts is revisited. H_2 self-
shielding is discussed, including the effects of line overlap. We find that
line overlap is important for N(H_2) > 10^{20} cm^{-2}. We compute multiline UV
pumping models, and compare these with simple analytic approximations for the
effects of self-shielding.
  The overall fluorescent efficiency of the photodissociation front is obtained
for different ratios of chi/n_H (where chi characterizes the intensity of the
incident UV) and different dust extinction laws. The dust optical depth
tau_{pdr} to the point where 50% of the H is molecular is found to be a simple
function of a dimensionless quantity phi_0 depending on chi/n_H, the rate
coefficient for H_2 formation on grains, and the UV dust opacity. The
fluorescent efficiency of the PDR also depends primarily on phi_0 for chi<3000
and n_H<10^4 cm^{-3}; for stronger radiation fields and higher densities
radiative and collisional depopulation of vibrationally-excited levels
interferes with the radiative cascade. The emission spectrum from the PDR is
essentially independent of the color temperature $T_{color}$ of the incident UV
for T_{color}>10^4K, but shows some sensitivity to the v-J distribution of
newly-formed H_2. The 1-0S(1)/2-1S(1) and 2-1S(1)/6-4Q(1) intensity ratios, the
ortho/para ratio, and the rotational temperature in the $v$=1 and $v$=2 levels
are computed as functions of the temperature and density, for different values
of chi and n_H.
  We apply our models to the reflection nebula NGC 2023. We are best able to
reproduce the observations with models having chi=5000, n_H=10^5 cm^{-3}.

Fortran code available from the authors","Astrophys.J.469:437-444,1996","10.1086/177793",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background
(CMB) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon
past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a
time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The
geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions which do not depend on the
particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of
photon, baryon and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a
small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates between
the dynamical and geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More
importantly, it allows to significantly reduce the computational time compared
to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on
the model and is generally the most time consuming part of calculation, is a
slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small
number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than
the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed
in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms and require a
much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about two orders of
magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically
requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should
be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters
from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become possible
with the next generation of experiments. A programm implementing this method
can be obtained from the authors.

``surrogate'') data for testing hypotheses about a given data set. The first
and more straightforward approach is to fit a single ``best'' model to the
original data, and then to generate surrogate data sets that are ``typical
realizations'' of that model. The second approach concentrates not on the model
but directly on the original data; it attempts to constrain the surrogate data
sets so that they exactly agree with the original data for a specified set of
sample statistics. Examples of these two approaches are provided for two simple
cases: a test for deviations from a gaussian distribution, and a test for
serial dependence in a time series. Additionally, we consider tests for
nonlinearity in time series based on a Fourier transform (FT) method and on
more conventional autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) fits to the data. The
comparative performance of hypothesis testing schemes based on these two
approaches is found to depend on whether or not the discriminating statistic is
pivotal. A statistic is ``pivotal'' if its distribution is the same for all
processes consistent with the null hypothesis. The typical-realization method
requires that the discriminating statistic satisfy this property. The
constrained-realization approach, on the other hand, does not share this
requirement, and can provide an accurate and powerful test without having to
sacrifice flexibility in the choice of discriminating statistic.

in $2+1$ dimensional constant curvature spacetimes solves the Sinh-Gordon
equation, the Cosh-Gordon equation or the Liouville equation. We show that in
both de Sitter and anti de Sitter spacetimes (as well as in the $2+1$ black
hole anti de Sitter spacetime), {\it all} three equations must be included to
cover the generic string dynamics. The generic properties of the string
dynamics are directly extracted from the properties of these three equations
and their associated potentials (irrespective of any solution). These results
complete and generalize earlier discussions on this topic (until now, only the
Sinh-Gordon sector in de Sitter spacetime was known). We also construct new
classes of multi-string solutions, in terms of elliptic functions, to all three
equations in both de Sitter and anti de Sitter spacetimes. Our results can be
straightforwardly generalized to constant curvature spacetimes of arbitrary
dimension, by replacing the Sinh-Gordon equation, the Cosh-Gordon equation and
the Liouville equation by higher dimensional generalizations.

the non commutative case using Tomita's involution $J$. We then write a
spectral action, the trace of a function of the length element in Planck units,
which when applied to the non commutative geometry of the Standard Model will
be shown (in a joint work with Ali Chamseddine) to give the SM Lagrangian
coupled to gravity. The internal fluctuations of the non commutative geometry
are trivial in the commutative case but yield the full bosonic sector of SM
with all correct quantum numbers in the slightly non commutative case. The
group of local gauge transformations appears spontaneously as a normal subgroup
of the diffeomorphism group.

of the scalar field in the rotating black holes. As one approaches the
stationary limit surface rather than the event horizon in comoving frame, those
become divergent. Only when the field is comoving with the black hole (i.e.
$\Omega_0 = \Omega_H$) those become divergent at the event horizon. In the
Hartle-Hawking state the leading terms of the entropy are $ A \frac{1}{h} + B
\ln(h) + finite$, where $h$ is the cut-off in the radial coordnate near the
horizon. In term of the proper distance cut-off $\epsilon$ it is written as $ S
= N A_H/\epsilon^2$. The origin of the divergence is that the density of state
on the stationary surface and beyond it diverges.

one-particle multiplicity distributions and two-particle correlations in nearly
central relativistic heavy-ion collisions that contains nine adjustable
parameters, which are necessary and sufficient to properly characterize the
gross properties of the source during its freezeout from a hydrodynamical fluid
into a collection of noninteracting, free-streaming hadrons. These nine
physically relevant parameters fall into three categories of three parameters
each, with the first category corresponding to the source's longitudinal
motion, the second category corresponding to its transverse motion, and the
third category corresponding to its intrinsic properties. As an initial
application, we apply our model to the analysis of invariant pi^+, pi^-, K^+,
and K^- one-particle multiplicity distributions and pi^+ and K^+ two-particle
correlations for nearly central Si + Au collisions at p_lab/A = 14.6 GeV/c. In
a minimization with 1416 data points, the resulting chi-square is 1484.6, which
corresponds to an acceptable chi-square per degree of freedom of 1.055. We list
the values of the nine parameters determined this way plus several additional
calculated freezeout quantities of physical interest, along with their
uncertainties at 99% confidence limits.
