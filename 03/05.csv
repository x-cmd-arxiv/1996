of the UV continuum and the Ly-alpha and C IV emission lines of the broad-line
radio galaxy 3C390.3 are studied. The UV continuum between 1220 and 1990 A has
varied considerably. In 1991 August, the flux at 1360 A reached a maximum level
~27 times as high as its minimum level. At 1850 A, the continuum varies by a
factor of ~12. Significant variations are frequently observed in periods as
short as one month. The total flux of Ly-alpha and C IV emission varies by a
factor of ~5. Their profiles are fitted with one narrow component, unresolved
at the instrumental resolution of FWHM ~2000 km/s, and three broad components
(FWHM ~6000 km/s). The narrow component varies by a factor of ~2.5. The broad
components on the blue and red wings of the Ly-alpha and C IV emission profile,
which correspond to the double humps in the H-alpha and H-beta emission
feature, display a close correlation to the varying continuum, with a time lag
of ~45 days. The blue Ly-alpha component has been stronger than the red
component except for several epochs in 1980 and 1991. The C IV/Ly-alpha flux
ratio is ~0.4 for the narrow component. For the broad components, this ratio
varies considerably around an average value of unity. In 1991 March, the blue
Ly-alpha component was stronger than the red, while for C IV the red component
was stronger. Such differential variations do not match the accretion disk
characteristics. The findings suggest that the narrow- and broad-line region in
3C 390.3 may be associated with a radio jet.

found that these calibrations yield a self-consistent set of atmospheric
parameters for \teff$>4400$~K, representing a clear improvement over results
obtained with older model atmospheres. Using this \teff-scale and Fe
equilibrium of ionization, we obtained very low gravities (implying
luminosities incompatible with that expected for RGB stars) for metal-poor
stars cooler than 4400~K; this might be due either to a moderate Fe
overionization (expected from statistical equilibrium calculations) or to
inadequacy of Kurucz models to describe the atmospheres of very cool giants.
Our \teff\ scale is compared with other scales recently used for metal-poor
stars; it agrees well with those obtained using Kurucz (1992) models, but it
gives much larger \teff's than those obtained using OSMARCS models (Edvardsson
et al. 1993). This difference is attributed to the different treatment of
convection in the two sets of models. For the Sun, the Kurucz (1992) model
appears to be preferable to the OSMARCS ones because it better predicts the
solar limb darkening; furthermore, we find that our photometric \teff's for

with \teff's derived from H$\alpha$\ wings when using Kurucz models.

on the properties of distant galaxies responsible for the DLA absorption. After
subtracting the point spread function associated with the QSO light, we have
detected galaxies very close to the QSO line of sight (projected distance
1.2-1.3arcsec) in two fields. These sources therefore represent promising
candidate galaxies responsible for the DLA absorption. Placed at the absorber's
redshift, the impact parameter is 10h_50^-1kpc and the luminosity is close to
L_K^*. Such parameters are consistent with the hypothesis, verified for
metallic systems at lower redshift, that slowly-evolving massive galaxies
produce at least some of the absorption systems of high column density in QSO
spectra out to beyond z=2. In addition to detecting these candidate DLA
galaxies, the radio-loud QSOs in our sample show a significant excess of
sources on larger scales (theta=7arcsec); this excess is not present in the
radio-quiet QSO sightlines. We calculate that such an excess could be produced
by luminous galaxies in the cores of clusters associated with radio-loud QSOs.
Both results confirm that deep imaging of selected QSOs can be a powerful
method of finding samples of likely z~2 galaxies. Follow-up near-infrared
spectroscopy is required to secure galaxy redshifts and star formation rates,
while deep HST imaging can determine sizes and morphologies, providing valuable
information on galaxy properties at large look-back times.

$P(k)$ caused by galaxy peculiar motions. We find some evidence for an effect,

$(\lambda\Phi^4)_4$. In the usual approach, inspired by perturbation theory,
one predicts a second-order phase transition, the Higgs mass $m_h$, related to
the value of the renormalized 4-point coupling, gets smaller when increasing
the ultraviolet cutoff and this leads to the generally quoted upper bounds
$m_h<$700-900 GeV. On the other hand, by exploring the structure of the
effective potential in those approximation consistent with `triviality', where
the Higgs mass does not represent a measure of any observable interaction, SSB
does not require an ultraviolet cutoff, the phase transition is first-order,
such that the massless `Coleman-Weinberg' regime lies in the broken phase, and
one gets only $m_h<$3 TeV from vacuum stability. To separate out the two
alternatives, we present a precise lattice computation of the slope of the
effective potential in the region of bare parameters indicated by the
Luscher~\&~Weisz and Brahm's analysis of the critical line. Our lattice data
strongly support the latter description of SSB. Indeed, our data cannot be
reproduced in perturbation theory, and then they confirm the existence on the
lattice of a remarkable phase of $(\lambda\Phi^4)_4$ where SSB is generated
through ``dimensional transmutation'', and show no evidence for residual
self-interaction effects of the shifted ``Higgs'' field
$h(x)=\Phi(x)-\langle\Phi\rangle$, in agreement with ``triviality''.

metric perturbations can be set to zero at the boundary, are then analyzed in
detail. Last, the evaluation of the 1-loop divergence in the axial gauge for
gravity is obtained. Interestingly, such a divergence turns out to coincide
with the one resulting from transverse-traceless perturbations.

shown that the multiple connectedness of the configuration space of a physical
system can determine the quantum nature of physical observables, such as the
angular momentum. In particular, quantum mechanics in compactified Kaluza-Klein
spaces is examined. These compactified spaces give rise to an additional
angular momentum which can adopt half-integer values and, therefore, may be
identified with the intrinsic spin of a quantum particle.

"math/9603215","Wolfram Koepf","Wolfram Koepf","The identification problem for transcendental functions",,,,"OP-SF 5 Mar 1996","math.CA",,"  In this article algorithmic methods are presented that have essentially been
introduced into computer algebra systems like Mathematica within the last
decade. The main ideas are due to Stanley and Zeilberger. Some of them had
already been discovered in the last century by Beke, but because of their
complexity the underlying algorithms have fallen into oblivion. We combined
these ideas, and added a factorization algorithm in noncommutative rings
(Melenk--Koepf \cite{MK}) leading to a solution of the identification problem
for a large class of transcendental functions. We present implementations of
these algorithms in computer algebra systems.

"math/9603216","Wolfram Koepf","Wolfram Koepf, Dieter Schmersau","On the De Branges theorem",,,,"OP-SF 5 Mar 1996","math.CA",,"  Recently, Todorov and Wilf independently realized that de Branges' original
proof of the Bieberbach and Milin conjectures and the proof that was later
given by Weinstein deal with the same special function system that de Branges
had introduced in his work.
  In this article, we present an elementary proof of this statement based on
the defining differential equations system rather than the closed
representation of de Branges' function system. Our proof does neither use
special functions (like Wilf's) nor the residue theorem (like Todorov's) nor
the closed representation (like both), but is purely algebraic.
  On the other hand, by a similar algebraic treatment, the closed
representation of de Branges' function system is derived. In a final section,
we give a simple representation of a generating function of the de Branges
functions.

positivity result of special functions which follows from an identity about
Jacobi polynomial sums that was found by Askey and Gasper in 1973, published in
1976.
  In 1991 Weinstein presented another proof of the Bieberbach and Milin
conjectures, also using a special function system which (by Todorov and Wilf)
was realized to be the same as de Branges'.
  In this article, we show how a variant of the Askey-Gasper identity can be
deduced by a straightforward examination of Weinstein's functions which
intimately are related with a L\""owner chain of the Koebe function, and
therefore with univalent functions.

algorithms it is now possible to combine high-dimensional quantum dynamical
calculations of the dissociative adsorption of molecular beams with reliable
ab-initio potential energy surfaces (PES). In this brief review two recent
examples of such studies of the systems H_2/Cu(111), where adsorption is
hindered by a noticeable energy barrier, and H_2/Pd(100), where activated as
well as non-activated paths to adsorption exist, are presented. The effect of
lateral surface corrugations on the sticking probability in the tunneling and
the classical regime and the role of additional parallel momentum are discussed
in the context of the H_2/Cu(111) results. For the system H_2/Pd(100) it is
shown that the initial decrease of the sticking probability with increasing
kinetic energy, which is usually attributed to a precursor mechanism, can be
explained by dynamical steering. In addition, the influence of rotation on the
adsorption and desorption dynamics is examined.
