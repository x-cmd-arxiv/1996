  Our conclusions are that existing redshift surveys provide little constraints
on the volume-density distribution of field galaxies faintwards of B Mag = -18.
The local MLRS suffer from poor statistics over inhomogeneous volumes, while
the faint MLRS are ambiguous because of the unknown nature of the ``faint blue

  Adopting a functional form similar to that seen in rich clusters we find that
the maximum allowable faint end slope, based on the Mt Stromlo-APM redshift

infrared lines. There must also be considerable opacity in the HeI 2 3P-2 3S

good agreement with most of the observed data if the hottest star present has

model we show that the model is equivalent to interacting WZW fields modulo
free fields. In this scheme, the order and disorder operators of the $Z_k$
parafermion theory are constructed as gauge invariant composites. We find that
the theory presents a duality symmetry that interchanges the roles of the spin
and dual spin operators. For two particular values of the coupling constant we
find that the theory recovers conformal invariance and the gauge symmetry is
enlarged. We also find a novel self-dual point.
