sweep of a binary inspiral [characterized by its chirp mass] to high accuracy.
The observed chirp mass is the intrinsic chirp mass of the binary source
multiplied by $(1+z)$, where $z$ is the redshift of the source. Assuming a
non-zero cosmological constant, we compute the expected redshift distribution
of observed events for an advanced LIGO detector. We find that the redshift
distribution has a robust and sizable dependence on the cosmological constant;
the data from advanced LIGO detectors could provide an independent measurement
of the cosmological constant.

unambiguously between stars and galaxies to $I=26.3$. We find no stars with
$V-I>1.8$ in the outer 90\% of the volume probed. This result places strong and
general constraints on the $I$ band luminosity of the constituents of the
Galactic dark halo: $$M_I > 15.9 + {5\over 3}\log\biggl(f{0.5 M_\odot\over

their density as a fraction of the local halo density, taken to be
$\rho_0=9\times 10^{-3}\,M_\odot\,\pc^{-3}$. If the halo is made of white
dwarfs, this limit implies that these objects have $M_V\gsim 18.4$ and
$V-I\gsim 2.5$. That is, they are $\gsim 2$ magnitudes fainter than the end of
the disk white dwarf sequence. Faint red dwarfs account for $<1\%$ of the
Galactic dark halo for $M_I<14$, and $<6\%$ for $M_I<15$ at the 95\% confidence
level. The density of inter-galactic Local Group stars is at least a factor
3000 smaller than the density of local Population II stars.

MNRAS in press",,"10.1093/mnras/281.3.830","CAP-9603003","astro-ph",,"  We report on an extensive series of numerical experiments of binary--binary
scattering, analysing the cross--section for close approach during interactions
for a range of hard binary parameters of interest in globular cluster cores. We
consider the implied rate for tidal interactions for different globular
clusters and compare our results with previous, complementary estimates of
stellar collision rates in globular clusters. We find that the collision rate
for binary--binary encounters dominates in low density clusters if the binary
fraction in the cluster is larger than $0.2$ for wide main--sequence binaries.
In dense clusters binary--single interactions dominate the collision rate and
the core binary fraction must be $\ltorder 0.1$ per decade in semi--major axis
or too many collisions take place compared to observations. The rates are
consistent if binaries with semi--major axes $\sim 100 AU$ are overabundant in
low density clusters or if breakup and ejection substantially lowers the binary
fraction in denser clusters. Given reasonable assumptions about fractions of
binaries in the cores of low density clusters such as NGC~5053, we cannot
account for all the observed blue stragglers by stellar collisions during
binary encounters, suggesting a substantial fraction may be due to coalescence
of tight primordial binaries.

the theory at certain `base points' of the Cauchy horizon, which are defined as
`past terminal accumulation points' of the horizon generators. Thus, the
theorems may be interpreted as giving support to Hawking's `Chronology
Protection Conjecture', according to which the laws of physics prevent one from
manufacturing a `time machine'. Specifically, we prove: Theorem 1: There is no
extension to (M,g_{ab}) of the usual field algebra on the initial globally
hyperbolic region which satisfies the condition of F-locality at any base
point. In other words, any extension of the field algebra must, in any globally
hyperbolic neighbourhood of any base point, differ from the algebra one would
define on that neighbourhood according to the rules for globally hyperbolic
spacetimes. Theorem 2: The two-point distribution for any Hadamard state
defined on the initial globally hyperbolic region must (when extended to a
distributional bisolution of the covariant Klein-Gordon equation on the full
spacetime) be singular at every base point x in the sense that the difference
between this two point distribution and a local Hadamard distribution cannot be
given by a bounded function in any neighbourhood (in MXM) of (x,x). Theorem 2
implies quantities such as the renormalized expectation value of \phi^2 or of
the stress-energy tensor are necessarily ill-defined or singular at any base
point. The proofs rely on the `Propagation of Singularities' theorems of
Duistermaat and H\""ormander.

in the restricted case of gap-one first-order differential Kac-Schwarz
operators. While the pair of constraints satisfying $[{\cal K}_1,W] = 1$ always
leads to Kontsevich type models, in the case of $[{\cal K}_1,W] = W$ the
corresponding KP $\tau$-functions are represented as more sophisticated matrix
integrals.

S-matrix. We find that the validity of the S-matrix implies violation of the
semi-classical approximation at scales large compared to the Planck scale. We
also show that the effect of the centrifugal barrier on the S-matrix is crucial
even for large transverse distances.

we obtain a new boson algebra having a shifted vacuum structure and define a
global operatal $U(1)$ gauge transformation.

commitment schemes, and they claim that their attack applies to the 1993
protocol of Brassard, Cr\'epeau, Jozsa and Langlois (BCJL). The intuition
behind their attack is correct, and indeed they expose a weakness common to all
proposals of a certain kind, but the BCJL protocol does not fall in this
category. Nevertheless, it is true that the BCJL protocol is insecure, but the
required attack and proof are more subtle. Here we provide the first complete
proof that the BCJL protocol is insecure.

the correlation established between observables of the apparatus and the
measured system. Using the framework of quantum measurement theory, necessary
and sufficient conditions for a measurement interaction to produce strong
correlations are given and are found to be related to properties of the final
object and apparatus states. These general results are illustrated with
reference to the standard model of the quantum theory of measurement.
