relativistic plasmas occupy the same volumes and are regulated by common
underlying parameters. The logarithmic slope of the relationship, ln(Sx-ray) =
1.2 x Sradio + ln(k) implies that the variations in brightness are primarily
due to path length differences. The X-ray and radio emissivities are both high
in the same general locations, but their more detailed relationship is poorly
constrained and probably shows significant scatter. The strongest radio and
X-ray absorption is found at the western boundary of Cas A. Based on the
properties of Cas A and the absorbing molecular cloud, we argue that they are
physically interacting. We also compare ASCA derived column densities with 21
cm H I and 18 cm OH optical depths in the direction of Cas A, in order to
provide an independent estimate of ISM properties. We derive an average value
for the H I spin temperature of about 40 K and measure the ratio of OH to

present a measurement of the deuterium to hydrogen ratio (D/H) in a newly
discovered high redshift metal-poor gas cloud at redshift $z=2.504$. This
confirms our earlier measurement of D/H (Tytler, Fan & Burles 1996), and
together they give the first accurate measurement of the primordial D
abundance, and a ten fold improvement in the accuracy of the cosmological
density of ordinary matter.This is a high density, with most ordinary matter
unaccounted or dark, which is too high to agree with measurements of the
primordial abundances of helium-4 and lithium-7. Since the D/H measurement is
apparently simple, direct, accurate and highly sensitive, we propose that
helium requires a systematic correction, and that population II stars have less
than the primordial abundance of $^7$Li. Alternatively, there is no concordance
between the light element abundances, and the simple model of the big bang must
be incomplete and lacking physics, or wrong.

Observations of high-redshift Ly-$\alpha$ clouds have provided discordant

previously accepted upper limit on ($^2$H + $^3$He)/H; and one system with a
significantly lower upper bound on $^2$H/H than those previously obtained. The
high value of $^2$H/H agrees well with the current observationally-inferred

$^2$H/H does not fit well with the current observationally-inferred primordial

is indicative of the primordial deuterium abundance, then significant depletion
of $^7$Li in old, hot Pop II halo stars is probably required to obtain a
concordant range of $\eta$, for {\em any} effective number of neutrino flavors.

we show that the intermittency can be described by a multifractal structure

result is summarized as a ground-state phase diagram drawn in terms of the
number of patterns per site, $\alpha$, and the strength of the transverse
field, $\Delta$. The phase diagram coincides very accurately with that of the

homogeneously the whole sample. While in the first description the tunneling
takes place mainly through photo sidebands in the case of homogeneous
illumination the main effective tunneling channels correspond to the coupling
between different electronic states due to photon absorption and emission. The
difference of tunneling mechanisms between these configurations is strongly
reflected in the transmission and current density which present very different
features in both cases. In order to analyze these effects we have obtained,
within the Transfer Hamiltonian framework, a general expression for the
transition probability for coherent resonant tunneling in terms of the Green's
function of the system.

analyzed. The interface undergoes a depinning transition where the order
parameter is the interface velocity $v$, which increases as $v \sim
(F-F_c)^\theta$ for driving forces $F$ close to its threshold value $F_c$. We
consider a Langevin-type equation which is expected to be valid close to the
depinning transition of an interface in a statistically isotropic medium. By a
functional renormalization group scheme the critical exponents characterizing
the depinning transition are obtained to the first order in $\epsilon=4-D>0$,
where $D$ is the interface dimension. The main results were published earlier

present details of the perturbative calculation and of the derivation of the
functional flow equation for the random-force correlator. The fixed point
function of the correlator has a cusp singularity which is related to a finite
value of the threshold $F_c$, similar to the mean field theory. We also present
extensive numerical simulations and compare them with our analytical results
for the critical exponents. For $\epsilon =1$ the numerical and analytical
results deviate from each other by only a few percent. The deviations in lower

gives rise to viable thermal inflation, and so does not suffer from a
Polonyi/moduli problem, should contain right-handed neutrinos which acquire
their masses due to the vacuum expectation value of the flaton that drives
thermal inflation. This strongly disfavours SO(10) Grand Unified Theories. The
$\mu$-term of the MSSM should also arise due to the vev of the flaton. With the
extra assumption that $ m_L^2 - m_{H_u}^2 < 0 $, but of course $ m_L^2 -
m_{H_u}^2 + |\mu|^2 > 0 $, we show that a complicated Affleck-Dine type of
baryogenesis employing an $LH_u$ $D$-flat direction can naturally generate the
baryon asymmetry of the Universe.

nonrelativistic particle, and compare the probabilities it yields with the ones
estimated indirectly in terms of the flux of the Schr\""odinger current. We
derive a well defined uncertainty relation between time-of-arrival and energy;
this result shows that the well known arguments against the existence of such a
relation can be circumvented. Finally, we define a ``time-representation'' of
the quantum mechanics of a free particle, in which the time-of-arrival is
diagonal. Our results suggest that, contrary to what is commonly assumed,
quantum mechanics exhibits a hidden equivalence between independent (time) and
