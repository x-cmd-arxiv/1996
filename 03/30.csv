can be detected by monitoring microlensed stars in the Galactic bulge. The star
and its planet act as a binary lens which generates a lightcurve which can
differ substantially from the lightcurve due only to the star itself. We show
that the planetary signal remains detectable for planetary masses as small as
an Earth mass when realistic source star sizes are included in the lightcurve
calculation. These planets are detectable if they reside in the ``lensing zone""
which is centered between 1 and 4 AU from the lensing star and spans about a
factor of 2 in distance. If we require a minimum deviation of 4\% from the
standard point-lens microlensing lightcurve, then we find that more than 2\% of
all $\mearth$ planets and 10\% of all $10\mearth$ in the lensing zone can be
detected. If a third of all lenses have no planets, a third have $1\mearth$
planets and the remaining third have $10\mearth$ planets then we estimate that
an aggressive ground based microlensing planet search program could find one
earth mass planet and half a dozen $10\mearth$ planets per year.

  Viscosity in Accretion Disks","22 pages, 1 figure",,"10.1086/178019",,"astro-ph",,"  We examine the speed of inward traveling cooling fronts in accretion disks.
We show that their speed is determined by the rarefaction wave that precedes
them and is approximately $\alpha_F c_{F} (H/r)^q$, where $\alpha_F$ is the
dimensionless viscosity, $c_{F}$ is the sound speed, $r$ is the radial
coordinate, $H$ is the disk thickness, and all quantities are evaluated at the
cooling front. The scaling exponent $q$ lies in the interval $[0,1]$, depending
on the slope of the $(T,\Sigma)$ relation in the hot state. For a Kramer's law
opacity and $\alpha\propto (H/r)^n$, where $n$ is of order unity, we find that
$q\sim 1/2$. This supports the numerical work of Cannizzo, Chen and Livio
(1995) and their conclusion that $n\approx3/2$ is necessary to reproduce the
exponential decay of luminosity in black hole X-ray binary systems. Our results
are insensitive to the structure of the disk outside of the radius where rapid
cooling sets in. In particular, the width of the rapid cooling zone is a
consequence of the cooling front speed rather than its cause. We conclude that
the exponential luminosity decay of cooling disks is probably compatible with
the wave-driven dynamo model. It is not compatible with models with separate,
constant values of $\alpha$ for the hot and cold states.

its application to target-space duality. In this article, we explore another
direction it motivates. In Sec.\ 1, conformal symmetry and some algebraic
structures of the system that are related to interacting strings are discussed.
These lead one naturally to the study of Lorentz surfaces in Sec.\ 2. In
contrast to the case of Riemann surfaces, we show in Sec.\ 3 that there are
Lorentz surfaces that cannot be conformally deformed into Mandelstam diagrams.
Lastly in Sec.\ 4, we discuss speculatively the prospect of Lorentzian
conformal field theory.
  Additionally, to have a view of what quantum picture a string Hamiltonian
system may lead to, we discuss independently in the Appendix a formal geometric
quantization of the string phase space.

gauge invariance in the continuum can be restored in some models by choosing
special boundary conditions for the fermions. Evidence is presented that gauge
averaging the overlap phases in these models produces correct continuum

planes so that it is equivalent to the usual equal-time formulation. This
construction is quite helpful in resolving the puzzling aspects of the
light-cone formalism. It furthermore allows the extraction of effective
Hamiltonians that incorporate vacuum physics, but that act in a Hilbert space
in which the vacuum state is simple. The discussion is fairly informal, and
focuses mainly on the conceptual issues. [Talk presented at {\sc Orbis

non-perturbative superpotential and use the original (s)quark and gauge fields,

a dual gauge group $SU(N_f-N_c)$. The presence of negative squark mass squared
terms leads to spontaneous breakdown of flavor and color symmetry. We determine
this breaking pattern, derive the spectrum, and argue that the masses vary
smoothly as one crosses from the Higgs phase into the confining phase.
