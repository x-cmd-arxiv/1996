We present accelerated algorithms for dilute spin glasses and display
explicitly their relation to the effective dynamics of specific collective
degrees of freedom (macros).
  We discuss the difficulties in applying multiscale-cluster algorithms(MCA) to
general frustrated systems: MCA does not succeed to break the system into
clusters. We relate these difficulties to rigorous negative results in systems
with an ultrametric space of ground states: the tunneling between vacua cannot
be expressed into an algorithm acting upon independent macros.

model leads to an asymptotic length-scale $L \sim (\rho t)^{1/2} \sim t^{1/3}$

density, $\rho \sim L^{-1}$. For $T>0$, activated kinetics recovers the
standard asymptotic growth-law, $L \sim t^{1/2}$. However, at all temperatures,
infinite-range energy-transport is allowed by the spin-exchange dynamics. A
better implementation of global conservation, the microcanonical Creutz
algorithm, is well behaved and exhibits the standard non-conserved growth law,
$L \sim t^{1/2}$, at all temperatures.

than any physical scale into a renormalization of the operators. In this work
we compute the renormalization constants of all bilinear quark operators of
leading twist and spin up to four. The calculation is done for Wilson fermions

Unruh ``box'' that arise when the accelerated box is replaced by a ``two level
ion'' immersed in a constant electric field and treated in second quantization.
There are two kinds of corrections, those due to recoil effects induced by the
momentum transfers and those due to pair creation. Taken together, these
corrections show that there is a direct relationship between pair creation
amplitudes described by the Heisenberg-Euler-Schwinger mechanism and the Unruh
effect, i.e. the thermalisation of accelerated systems at temperature $a/ 2
\pi$ where $a$ is the acceleration. In particular, there is a thermodynamical
consistency between both effects whose origin is that the euclidean action
governing pair creation rates acts as an entropy in delivering the Unruh
temperature. Upon considering pair creation of charged black holes in an
electric field, these relationships explain why black holes are created from
vacuum in thermal equilibrium, i.e. with their Hawking temperature equal to
their Unruh temperature.
