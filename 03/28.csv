with high rms velocity) derives from the decay of a heavier particle. Such
models based on cold+volatile dark matter (CVDM) differ from the standard
mixture of CDM and massive neutrinos, usually known as CHDM, in that they
involve a component which has a non--thermal phase space distribution function.
As a consequence, and differently from CHDM models, the value of the redshift
at which volatile particles become non relativistic, $z_{nr}$, can be varied
almost independently of the volatile fraction, $\Omega_X$. We compute transfer
functions for a selection of such models, having $0.1\le \Omega_X\le 0.5$ and
different values of $z_{nr}$. Using linear theory and assuming a scale--free
primordial spectrum, we compare such models with observational constraints on
large--scale galaxy clustering and bulk flows, as well as on the abundance of
galaxy clusters and high--redshift damped Ly$\alpha$ systems. We find that
these constraints enable us to discriminate between different $\Omega_X$ and
$z_{nr}$; within the range of the models inspected, those which can be most
easily accommodated by the data correspond to the parameter choice
$\Omega_X\simeq 0.2$ and $z_{nr} \simeq 2\times 10^4\Omega_X$.

than the electrons and forming an ion-supported torus. We show that the
electron te mperature then saturates at approximately 100keV independent of
model parameters. At this temperature the hard X-ray emission is dominated by
bremsstrahlung radiation. We find that this physical model gives an excellent
fit to the spectrum of the XRB in the 3-60 keV range, provided that there is
some evolution associated with the spectral emissivity which must peak at a
redshift of about 2. We estimate that such galaxies contribute only to a small

examined, and a linear stability analysis is performed to obtain response
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Both the static behavior and the linear
response show an inertial range with a relatively simple scaling structure. Our
main results are: (i) The response frequencies cover a wide range of scales,
with ratios which can be understood in terms of the frequency scaling
properties of the model. (ii) Even small viscosities play a crucial role in
determining the model's eigenvalue spectrum. (iii) As a parameter within the

energy and become massless. Our explicit construction of the diagonal resolvent

probability decays as a non-universal power law, S_N(t) is proportional to
t^{-beta_N}, with the decay exponent beta_N proportional to ln N. The crossover
behavior as a function of the relative diffusivities of the lions and the lamb
is also discussed. When N--->oo, the lamb survival probability exhibits a
log-normal decay, exp(-ln^2 t).

obtain the wave function of the scattering state in this system. In spite of
working with a plane wave as an incident wave we obtain the same wave function
as was given by Aharonov and Bohm. Another method to solve the scattering
problem is given by making use of a modified version of Gordon's idea which was
invented to consider the scattering by the Coulomb potential. These two methods
give the same result, which guarantees the validity of taking an incident plane
wave as usual to make an analysis of this scattering problem. The scattering
problem by a solenoid of finite radius is also discussed, and we find that the
vector potential of the solenoid affects the charged particles even when the
magnitude of the flux is an odd integer as well as noninteger. It is shown that
the unitarity of the $S$ matrix holds provided that a plane wave is taken to be
an incident one.

reduction is performed by imposing a nonlinear superfield constraint which
turns out to be a mixture of a first- and second-class constraint on
supercurrent components. Supersymmetry of the model is realized nonlinearly and
is spontaneously broken. The set of independent current fields which survive
the Hamiltonian reduction contains (in the holomorphic sector) one bosonic
current of spin 2 (the stress--tensor of the spin 0 Liouville mode) and two
fermionic fields of spin ${3/2}$ and $-1/2$. The $n=1$ superconformal system
thus obtained is of the same kind as one describing noncritical fermionic
strings in a universal string theory. The generalization of this procedure
allows one to produce from any bosonic Lie algebra super--Toda models and
associated super-W algebras together with their nonstandard realizations.

the Wu-Yang (1976) criterion in which dynamics result as a consequence of the
constraint defining the monopole as a topological obstruction in the field. The
usual path-integral approach is adopted, but using loop space variables of the
type introduced by Polyakov (1980). An anti-symmetric tensor potential
$L_{\mu\nu}[\xi|s]$ appears as the Lagrange multiplier for the Wu-Yang
constraint which has to be gauge-fixed because of the ``magnetic''
$\widetilde{U}$-symmetry of the theory. Two sets of ghosts are thus introduced,
which subsequently integrate out and decouple. The generating functional is
then calculated to order $g^0$ and expanded in a series in $\widetilde{g}$. It
is shown to be expressible in terms of a local ``dual potential''
$\widetilde{A}_\mu (x)$ found earlier, which has the same progagator and the
same interaction vertex with the monopole field as those of the ordinary
Yang-Mills potential $A_\mu$ with a colour charge, indicating thus a certain
degree of dual symmetry in the theory. For the abelian case the Feynman rules
obtained here are the same as in QED to all orders in $g$, as expected by dual
symmetry.

kinetic term in order to obtain a quantization invariant under scaling. Namely,
BRST quantization does not lead to the curvature term used in the literature as
a means to get that invariance. The inclusion of the potential in the kinetic
term, far from being unnatural, is beautifully justified in light of the
Jacobi's principle.

the same universal-existential sentences Th(F$_2$)$\cap \forall \exists $ in a
first-order language L$_o$ appropriate for group theory. It is shown that in
every model of Th(F$_2$)$\cap \forall \exists $ the maximal Abelian subgroups
are elementarily equivalent to locally cyclic groups (necessarily nontrivial
and torsion free). Two classes of groups are interpolated between the
non-Abelian locally free groups and Remeslennikov's $\exists $-free groups.
These classes are the \textbf{almost locally free groups} and the
\textbf{quasi-locally free groups}. In particular, the almost locally free%
\textbf{\ }groups are the models of Th(F$_2$)$\cap \forall \exists $ while the
quasi-locally free groups are the $\exists $-free groups with maximal Abelian
subgroups elemenatarily equivalent to locally cyclic groups (necessarily
nontrivial and torsion free). Two principal open questions at opposite ends of
a spectrum are: (1.) Is every finitely generated almost locally free group
free? (2.) Is every quasi-locally free group almost locally free? Examples
abound of finitely generated quasi-locally free groups containing nontrivial
torsion in their Abelianizations. The question of whether or not almost locally
free groups have torsion free Abelianization is related to a bound in a free
group on the number of factors needed to express certain elements of the
derived group as a product of commutators.

nuclei is evaluated starting from a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction. The
calculations are performed directly for the finite nucleus $\,^{16}$O making
use of the Green's function approach. The emphasis is focused on the
correlations induced by the excitation modes at low energies described within a
model-space of shell-model configurations including states up to the sdg shell.
Our analysis demonstrates that these long-range correlations do not produce any
significant enhancement of the momentum distribution at high missing momenta
and low missing energies. This is in agreement with high resolution $(e,e'p)$
experiments for this nucleus. We also try to simulate the corresponding effects
in large nuclei by quenching the energy-spacing between single-particle orbits.
This yields a sizable enhancement of the spectral function at large momenta and
small energy. Such behavior could explain the deviation of the momentum
distribution from the mean field prediction, which has been observed in
$(e,e'p)$ experiments on heavy nuclei like $^{208}$Pb.

when the entropy per baryon is of order 1 or 2 and neutrinos are trapped on
dynamical timescales. In all cases, the thermal effects for an entropy per
baryon of order 2 or less are small when considering the maximum neutron star
mass. Neutrino trapping, however, significantly changes the maximum mass due to
the abundance of electrons. When matter is allowed to contain only nucleons and
leptons, trapping decreases the maximum mass by an amount comparable to, but
somewhat larger than, the increase due to finite entropy. When matter is
allowed to contain strongly interacting negatively charged particles, in the
form of strange baryons, a kaon condensate, or quarks, trapping instead results
in an increase in the maximum mass of order $0.2M_\odot$, which adds to the
effects of finite entropy. The presence of negatively-charged particles has two
major implications. First, the value of the maximum mass will decrease during
the early evolution of a neutron star as it loses trapped neutrinos, so that if
a black hole forms, it either does so immediately after the bounce or it is
delayed for a neutrino diffusion timescale of $\sim 10$ s. The latter case is
most likely if the maximum mass of the hot star with trapped neutrinos is near
$1.5M_\odot$. In the absence of negatively-charged hadrons, black hole
formation would be due to accretion and therefore is likely to occur only
immediately after bounce. Second, the appearance of hadronic negative charges
results in a general softening of the equation of state that may be observable
in the neutrino luminosities and average energies. Further, these additional
negative charges decrease the electron fraction and may be observed in the
relative excess of electron neutrinos compared to other neutrinos.
