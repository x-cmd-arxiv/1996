problem by merging a NLO calculation of direct photon production with extra
multiple parton emissions via the parton shower (PS) algorithm. Our calculation
maintains the integrity of the underlying NLO calculation while avoiding
ambiguities due to double counting of multiple parton emissions. We find that
the NLO+PS calculation can account for much of the theory/CDF data discrepancy
at $\sqrt{s}=1.8$ TeV. It can also account for much of the theory/UA2
discrepancy if a very large virtuality is assumed to initiate the initial state
parton shower. For lower energy data sets ({\it e.g.} $\sqrt{s}< 63$ GeV),
NLO+PS calculations alone cannot account for the data/theory discrepancy, so
that some additional non-perturbative $k_T$ smearing is needed.

of 't Hooft. These dual operators provide a complete description of the
physical phase space of the theories.

particular, the ZFC Replacement and Separation schemata in the language
containing the membership and standardness predicates, and Saturation for
well-orderable families of internal sets.
  This theory admits an adequate formulation of the isomorphism property IP:
""any two elementarily equivalent internally presented structures of a
wellorderable language are isomorphic.""
  IP implies, for instance, that all infinite internal sets are equinumerous,
and there exists a unique (modulo isomorphisms) internal elementary extension
of the standard reals.
  We prove that IP is independent of HST (using the class of all sets
constructible from internal sets) and consistent with HST (using generic
extensions of $\HST$ models by a sufficient number of generic isomorphisms).
