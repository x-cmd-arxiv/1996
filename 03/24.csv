  mode)",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  We provide a new proof of the following result:
  Let $X$ be a variety of finite type over an algebraically closed field $k$ of
characteristic 0, let $Z\subset X$ be a proper closed subset. There exists a
modification $f:X_1 \rar X$, such that $X_1$ is a quasi-projective nonsingular
variety and $Z_1 = f^{-1}(Z)_\red$ is a strict divisor of normal crossings.
  Needless to say, this theorem is a weak version of Hironaka's well known
theorem on resolution of singularities. Our proof has the feature that it
builds on two standard techniques of algebraic geometry: semistable reduction
for curves, and toric geometry.
  Another proof of the same result was discovered independently by F. Bogomolov
and T. Pantev. The two proofs are similar in spirit but quite different in
detail.

"alg-geom/9603019","Tony Pantev","Fedor Bogomolov and Tony Pantev","Weak Hironaka theorem","11 pages, minor corrections, version revised for publication LATEX 2e",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  The purpose of this note is to give a simple proof of the following theorem:
Let $X$ be a normal projective variety over an algebraically closed field $k$,
$\op{char} k = 0$ and let $D \subset X$ be a proper closed subvariety of $X$.
Then there exist a smooth projective variety $M$, a strict normal crossings
divisor $R \subset M$ and a birational morphism $f : M \to X$ with $f^{-1} D =
R$. The method of proof is inspired by A.J. de Jong alteration ideas. We also
use a multidimensional version of G.Belyi argument which allows us to simplify
the shape of a ramification divisor. By induction on the dimension of $X$ the
problem is reduced to resolving toroidal singularities. This process however is
too crude and does not permit any control over the structure of the birational
map $f$. A different proof of the same theorem was found independently by D.
Abramovich and A.J. de Jong. The approach is similar in both proofs but they
seem to be rather different in details.

  Soc. Jpn. vol.65 (1996) No. 4",,"10.1143/JPSJ.65.992",,"cond-mat",,"  The structure of moving nonlinear excitations in one-dimensional
electron-phonon systems is studied semi-phenomenologically by using an
effective action in which the width of the nonlinear excitation is treated as a
dynamical variable. The effective action can be derived from Su, Schrieffer and
Heeger's model or its continuum version proposed by Takayama, Lin-Liu and Maki
with an assumption that the nonlinear excitation moves uniformly without any
deformation except the change of its width. The form of the action is
essentially the same as that discussed by Bishop and coworkers in studying the
dynamics of the soliton in polyacetylene, though some details are different.
For the moving excitation with a velocity $v$, the width is determined by
minimizing the effective action. A requirement that there must be a minimum in
the action as a function of its width provides a maximum velocity. The velocity
dependence of the width and energy can be determined. The motions of a soliton
in p olyacetylene and an acoustic polaron in polydiacetylene are studied within
this formulation. The obtained results are in good agreement with those of
numerical simulations.

simplified model of string dynamics. The dynamics incorporates some novel
features which, to our knowledge, have not been studied in previous numerical
simulations: The existence of two types of string which may have different
tensions, and the possibility that two non-commuting strings may intersect.
Simulation of the non-commuting fluxes presents a computational challenge as it
requires a rather complex gauge-fixing procedure. The flux definitions change
as strings change their positions and orientations relative to each other and
must be carefully updated as the network evolves. The method is described here
in some detail, with results to be presented elsewhere.

When the four-Fermi interaction is absent, the $\beta$-function for the
electromagnetic coupling vanishes in the leading order in $1/N$. By solving the
Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion propagator, we show that in $1/N$
expansion, for any electromagnetic coupling, dynamical symmetry breaking occurs
due to the presence of Landau energy gap by the external magnetic field.

classical flat directions that are only lifted quantum mechanically, are
presented. Finally, by integrating in vector matter, the strongly coupled
region of chiral models with a dynamically generated superpotential is shown to
be continuously connected to a weakly coupled description in terms of confined
degrees of freedom, with supersymmetry broken at tree level.

This definition consists of a ``skew-symmetry'' relation and a ``Jacobi
identity'' relation in a categorical setting. In this paper, we show directly
that these chiral algebras are essentially the same as vertex algebras without
vacuum vector (and without grading), by establishing an equivalence between the
skew-symmetry and Jacobi identity relations of Beilinson-Drinfeld and the
(similarly-named, but different) skew-symmetry and Jacobi identity relations in
