determined by solving the basic sets of linear algebraic equations which
describe the coupling the tangential electric fields on the right and left

numerical simulations of the dependence of electrodynamic characteristics on
the number of connections between the modes taken into account. Based on these

variations, often giving rise to red-noise components in their power spectra.
Searching for a narrow power spectrum peak resulting from a periodic modulation
over the frequency range in which ``coloured'' noise components are dominant
has proven a very complex task. We develop here a technique aimed at detecting
periodicities in the presence of ``coloured'' power spectrum components, while
mantaining the highest Fourier frequency resolution. First we introduce a
simple approximation to the statistical properties of the ``coloured'' power
spectra from celestial objects, based on a few examples and the theory of
linear processes. We then estimate the continuum components in the power
spectrum through an ad hoc smoothing technique. By dividing the sample spectrum
by the smoothed one, a white-noise like spectrum is obtained, the approximate
probability distribution of which is derived. A search for coherent pulsations
is then carried out by looking for peaks in the divided spectrum, the chance
probability of which is below a given detection threshold. The technique is
tested and its range of applicability determined through extensive numerical
simulations. We present also an application to the X-ray light curves of
V0332+53, a highly variable accreting X-ray pulsar, and GX13+1, a bright and

matter halos within the initial density field are determined by the peak
formalism and by an extension of the Press-Schechter formalism, respectively.
Modifications of these distributions caused by gravitationally induced motions
are treated using a spherical collapse model. We test our model against results
from a variety of N-body simulations. The model works well for peaks and for
halos that are identified earlier than the time when the moments are
calculated. Because halos are spatially exclusive at the time of their
identification, our model is only qualitatively correct for halos identified at
the same time as the moments are calculated. The S_j depend only weakly on the
bias parameter b for large b but increase rapidly with decreasing b at b\sim 1.
Thus if galaxies are associated with peaks in the initial density field, or
with dark halos formed at high redshifts, a measurement of S_j in the
quasilinear regime should determine whether galaxies are significantly biased
relative to the mass. We use our model to interpret the observed high order
correlation functions of galaxies and clusters. We find that if the values of
S_j for galaxies are as high as those given by the APM survey, then APM
galaxies should not be significantly biased.

during 1994 November as part of the MUSICOS-94 campaign. The star has two
closely-spaced periods of about 0.75 d and is the brightest member of a new
class of variable early F-type stars. A previously suspected third period, very
close to the other two, is confirmed. Previous observations indicated that
sudden changes could be expected in the spectrum, but none were found during
the campaign. The radial velocities rule out the possibility of a close
companion. The phasing between the radial velocity and light curve of the
strongest periodic component rules out the starspot model. The only viable
mechanism for understanding the variability is nonradial pulsation. We used the
method of moments to identify the modes of pulsation of the three periodic

More than half of the present clusters (52%-58% for the OC galactic model, and
75%-86% for the BSS model) will be destroyed in the next Hubble time. For the
evolution of individual clusters we use a Fokker-Planck code including two-body
relaxation, tidal truncation of clusters, compressive gravitational shocks
while clusters pass through the Galactic disk, and tidal shocks due to passage
close to the bulge. Gravitational shocks are treated comprehensively, using a
recent result by Kundic & Ostriker (1995) that the shock-induced relaxation
term, driving an additional dispersion of energies, is generally more important
than the usual energy shift term. We discuss some implications for a past
history of the Globular Cluster System, and the initial distribution of the
destruction times raising the possibility that the current population is but a
very small fraction of the initial population with the remnants of the
destroyed clusters constituting presently a large fraction of the spheroid

consequence the effective axial-current neutrino-nucleon scattering cross

perturbative limit $\Gamma_\sigma\ll T$. By virtue of an exact sum rule of the
spin-density structure function, we express the modified cross section in terms
of the matrix element for neutrino-nucleon scattering in the presence of a
spin-dependent nuclear potential. This representation allows for a direct
comparison with and confirmation of Sawyer's related perturbative result. In a
supernova core with a typical temperature $T=10\,\rm MeV$, the perturbative
limit is relevant for densities $\rho\alt10^{13}\,\rm g\,cm^{-3}$ and thus
applies around the neutrino sphere. There, the cross-section reduction is of
order a few percent and thus not large; however, a new mode of energy transfer
between neutrinos and nucleons is enabled which may be important for neutrino
spectra formation. We derive an analytic perturbative expression for the rate
of energy transfer.

Schwinger-Dyson equation and the Pagels-Stokar formula. It is particularly
emphasized that the critical phenomenon gives a simple reason why the top quark
can have an extremely large mass compared with other quarks and leptons. Then
we discuss the Bardeen-Hill-Lindner (BHL) formulation based on the
renormalization-group equation and the compositeness condition, which
successfully picks up 1/N_c-sub-leading effects disregarded by MTY. In fact BHL
is equivalent to MTY at the 1/N_c-leading order. Such a simplest version of the
model predicts the top quark mass, m_t \simeq 250 GeV (MTY) and m_t \simeq 220
GeV (BHL), for the cutoff on the Planck scale. In this version we cannot take
the cutoff beyond the Landau pole of U(1)_Y gauge coupling, which yields a
minimum value of the top mass prediction m_t \simeq 200 GeV. We then propose a
``top mode walking GUT'' : The standard gauge groups are unified into a
(``walking'') GUT so that the cutoff can be taken to infinity thanks to the
renormalizability of the four-fermion theory coupled to ``walking'' gauge
theory. The top and Higgs mass prediction is then controlled by the
Pendleton-Ross infrared fixed point at GUT scale and can naturally lead to m_t
\simeq m_H \simeq 180 GeV.

of disoriented chiral condensates (DCCs). We find that instabilities exist for
proper times which are less than 3 fm/c. We also show that an experimental
signature of domain growth is an increase in the low momentum spectrum of
outgoing pions when compared to an expansion in thermal equilibrium. In
comparison to particle production during a longitudinal expansion, we find that
in a spherical expansion the system reaches the ``out'' regime much faster and

analogies with the Witten-Seiberg story about $N=2$ $QCD$. Though the
microscopic theory is apparently not integrable, the effective theory is shown
to be integrable at classical level, and a general solution of it in terms of
hypergeometric functions is obtained. An effective theory for the multiparticle
soft scattering is sketched.

propose new strategies for extracting the source lifetime. Longitudinal
expansion of the source can be seen directly in the rapidity dependence of the
