lattices containing up to $256^3$ spins. These results were obtained by means
of the Cluster Processor, a newly built special-purpose computer for the Wolff
cluster simulation of the 3D Ising model. We find that the magnetization $M(t)$
is perfectly described by $M(t)=(a_0-a_1 t^{\theta} - a_2 t) t^{\beta} $, where
$t=(T_{\rm c}-T)/T_{\rm c}$, in a wide temperature range $0.0005 < t < 0.26 $.
If there exist corrections to scaling with higher powers of $t$, they are very
small. The magnetization exponent is determined as $\beta=0.3269$ (6). An
analysis of the magnetization distribution near criticality yields a new
determination of the critical point: $K_{\rm c}=J/k_B T_{\rm c}=0.2216544$,
with a standard deviation of $3\cdot 10^{-7}$.

framework of the statistical mechanics of random diluted systems. We find that
at the transition the entropy is finite and hence that the transition itself is
due to the abrupt appearance of logical contradictions in all solutions and not
to the progressive decreasing of the number of these solutions down to zero. A
physical interpretation is given for the different cases $K=1$, $K=2$ and $K
\geq 3$.

and oscillating external fields. We consider Bloch oscillations and
Wannier-Stark localization caused by dc fields, and compare these effects to
dynamic localization that occurs in the presence of additional ac fields. Our
analysis relies on quasienergy eigenstates, which take over the role of the
usual Bloch waves. The widths of the quasienergy bands depend non-monotonically
on the field parameters. If there is lattice disorder, the degree of the
resulting Anderson localization is determined by the ratio of disorder strength
and quasienergy band width. Therefore, the localization lengths can be
controlled, within wide ranges, by adjusting the ac amplitude. Experimental
realizations of our model systems are given by semiconductor superlattices in
far-infrared laser fields, or by ultracold atoms in modulated standing light
waves. In both cases the system parameters, as well as the field amplitudes and
frequencies, are readily accessible to experimental control, suggesting these
as highly attractive candidates for systematic study of localization phenomena.

(secondary structures, tertiary symmetries, etc.) absent in random compact
conformations. We demonstrate in a simple lattice model of protein folding that
structural regularities are related to high designability and evolutionary
stability. We measure the designability of each compact structure by the number
of sequences which can design the structure, i.e., which possess the structure
as their nondegenerate ground state. We find that compact structures are
drastically different in terms of their designability; highly designable
structures emerge with a number of associated sequences much larger than the
average. These structures are found to have ``protein like'' secondary
structure and even tertiary symmetries. In addition, they are also
thermodynamically more stable than ordinary structures. These results suggest
that protein structures are selected because they are easy to design and stable
against mutations, and that such a selection simutaneously leads to
thermodynamic stability.

show that an ideal (Gaussian) chain of N monomers remains expanded as long as
M<<N; its mean squared end to end distance growing as r^2 ~ M/N. A possible
collapse transition (to a region of order unity) is related to percolation in a
one dimensional model with long--ranged connections. A directed version of the
model is also solved exactly. Based on these results, we conjecture that the
typical size of a self-avoiding polymer is reduced by the links to R >

dimensions thus scales as N^(phi), with (phi) > 0.43.

breaking. In particular the chiral condensate of q anti-q pairs is parametrized
with two angles, phi which measures the chiral condensation, and theta which
measures the chiral rotation. The strong CP problem arises when it is assumed
that the current quark masses of the Standard Model, have a theta phase that
differs from the phase induced by the instanton term wich is originated in the
QCD sector of the Standard Model. We show how chiral symmetry breaking may
solve the strong CP problem at the BCS level. We show variationally that the
physical vacuum is CP conserving and therefore the interplay of the instanton
and the current mass terms cannot produce any strong CP violation. We also
study the possible effect of theta in weak interactions, and conclude that it
does not produce weak CP.
