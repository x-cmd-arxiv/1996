keV and low-energy turnovers that are much steeper than a Wien spectrum. Baring
(1995) found that the spectra of cascades due to photon splitting in a very
strong, homogeneous magnetic field can soften spectra and produce good fits to
the soft spectra of SGRs. Magnetic field strengths somewhat above the QED
critical field strength $B_{\rm cr}$, where $B_{\rm cr} = 4.413 \times 10^{13}$
G, is required to produce cutoffs at 30-40 keV. We have improved upon this
model by computing Monte Carlo photon splitting cascade spectra in a neutron
star dipole magnetic field, including effects of curved space-time in a
Schwarzschild metric. We investigate spectra produced by photons emitted at
different locations and observer angles. We find that the general results of
Baring hold for surface emission throughout most of the magnetosphere, but that
emission in equatorial regions can best reproduce the constancy of SGR spectra
observed from different bursts.

extreme ultraviolet. We initiate the first large-scale, multi-line
investigation of correlations between the QSO soft X-ray continuum and UV line
emission, using an IUE/Einstein sample. We characterize the distributions of
line equivalent and velocity widths (EW and FWHM) of 85 QSOs in the IUE atlas
of Lanzetta et al. (1993), using a new error analysis for objective, automated
line measurements, and contrast measured line parameters to the QSO continuum
spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We find significant correlations between
EW and UV luminosity (e.g., the well-studied Baldwin effect) for Lya, CIV,
HeII, and CIII. EW(CIII) and EW(HeII) show previously unreported correlations
with Lx which for CIII appears to be primary. The line ratios CIII/Lya and
HeII/Lya both show strongest dependence on Lx. EW(Lya) correlates strongly with
spectral slopes \alpha_{uv} and \alpha_{ox}, but NOT with Lx. We argue that one
simple geometrical interpretation of the Baldwin effect (BEff) as a result of a
distribution of disk inclinations is not plausible. The BEff weakens or
disappears when line emission is correctly compared to the luminosity in the
continuum bandpass relevant to its production, which suggests that the BEff is
due to a change in SED with luminosity. Our prediction that no BEff relative to
X-ray luminosity should be found for FeII or MgII emission lines, will be
tested in a later paper, extended to a wider redshift/luminosity range.

cluster masses range between 6 x 10^14 solar masses and 4 x 10^15 solar masses,
and they are examined at redshifts between 1 and 0. We compute the X-ray
emission of the intracluster gas by thermal bremsstrahlung, add background
contamination, and mimic imaging and spectral observations with current X-ray
telescopes. Although the beta model routinely provides excellent fits to the
X-ray emission profiles, the derived masses are typically biased low because of
the restricted range of radii within which the fit can be done. For beta values
of ~ 2/3, which is the average in our numerically simulated sample, the mass is
typically underestimated by ~ 40 per cent. The masses of clusters which exhibit
pronounced substructure are often substantially underestimated. We suggest that
the ratio between peak temperature and emission-weighted average cluster
temperature may provide a good indicator for ongoing merging and, therefore,
for unreliable mass estimates. X-ray mass estimates are substantially improved
if we fit a King density profile rather than the beta model to the X-ray
emission, thereby dropping the degree of freedom associated with beta. Clusters
selected for their strong lensing properties are typically dynamically more
active than typical clusters. Bulk flows in the intracluster gas contain a
larger than average fraction of the internal energy of the gas in such objects,
hence the measured gas temperatures are biased low. The bulk of the optical
depth for arc formation is contributed by clusters with intermediate rather
than high X-ray luminosity. Arcs occur predominantly in clusters which exhibit
substructure and are not in an equilibrium state. Finally we explain why the

contrasted to the effective potential obtained in several covariant
gauge-fixing schemes, and the gauge invariant quantities that can be reliably
extracted from these are identified. It is pointed out that the gauge invariant
effective potential in the one-loop approximation is complex for {\em all
values} of the order parameter between the maximum and the minimum of the tree
level potential, both at zero and non-zero temperature. The imaginary part is
related to long-wavelength instabilities towards phase separation. We study the
real-time dynamics of initial states in the spinodal region, and relate the
imaginary part of the effective potential to the growth rate of equal-time
gauge invariant correlation functions in these states. We conjecture that the
spinodal instabilities may play a role in non-equilibrium processes {\em
inside} the nucleating bubbles if the transition is first order.

this way we get an effective field theory with SU(N)$\times$SU(N) gauge
symmetry. In the instanton approximation our effective theory has in addition a
N=2 supersymmetry, and when we sum over all possible solutions we find a
Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetry. These extra symmetries can then be broken
explicitly by a SU(N) invariant and power counting renormalizable mass term.
Our results suggest that the confinement mechanism which has been recently
identified in the N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory might also help to
understand color confinement in ordinary, pure Yang-Mills theory. In
