  some minor errors and adds some references",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  In this paper we develop an equivariant intersection theory for actions of
algebraic groups on algebraic schemes. The theory is based on our construction
of equivariant Chow groups. They are algebraic analogues of equivariant
cohomology groups which satsify the formal properties of ordinary Chow groups.
In addition, they enjoy many of the properties of equivariant cohomology. The
principal results are: (1) We prove the existence of canonical intersection
products on the Chow groups of geometric quotients of smooth varieties- even
when the stabilizers of geometric points are non-reduced. (2) We construct a
Todd class map from equivariant $K$-theory of coherent sheaves to a completion
of equivariant Chow groups, and prove that a completion of equivariant
$K$-theory is isomorphic to the completion of equivariant Chow groups. (3) We
prove a localization theorem for torus actions and use it to give a
characteristic free proof of the Bott residue formula for actions of tori on
complete smooth varieties.

  We have investigated the soft X-ray and broad band spectral properties and
discuss the consequences for the X-ray emission processes. For the first time a
clear dependence of the X-ray spectral steepness on the radio to X-ray spectral
energy distribution is found: {alpha}_{rx} and {alpha}_{x} are correlated in
the X-ray selected (XBL) subsample and anticorrelated in the radio selected
(RBL) subsample. The objects with intermediate {alpha}_{rx} values thus do have
the steepest soft X-ray spectra. Simulated PSPC spectra based on a set of
simple two component multifrequency spectra are in good agreement with the
measurements and suggest a broad range of synchrotron cutoff energies.
  We have calculated synchrotron self-Compton beaming factors for a subsample
of radio bright objects and find a correlation of the beaming factors
{delta}_{IC} with {alpha}_{rx} and {alpha}_{x}.
  The most extreme RBL objects are very similar to flat spectrum radio quasars
in all their broad band and X-ray properties.

admit hole doping without altering its structure of coupled copper oxide

spin gap and a spin-liquid state, NMR results indicate magnetic order at low
temperatures. These seemingly contradictory results may be reconciled if in
fact the magnetic state is near the crossover from spin liquid to
antiferromagnet, and we investigate this possibility. From a tight-binding fit
to the valence LDA bandstructure, we deduce that the strength of the
interladder hopping term is approximately half that of intraladder hopping,
showing that the material is three-dimensional in character. A mean-field
treatment of the insulating magnetic state gives a spin-liquid phase whose spin
gap decreases with increasing interladder coupling, vanishing (signalling a
transition to the ordered phase) at a value somewhat below that obtained for
LaCuO$_{2.5}$. The introduction of an on-site repulsion term, $U$, to the band
scheme causes a transition to an antiferromagnetic insulator for rather small
but finite values of $U$, reflecting the predominance of (one-dimensional)
ladder behavior, and an absence of any special nesting features.

and for small center-of-mass velocities the flux lines prefer traveling in
narrow channels uniquely determined by the pinning configuration. At a certain
critical drag force there is a dynamic transition from this glassy state into a
more ordered crystalline state, in which the channel structure vanishes. The
channels are studied by monitoring the particle trajectories and the spatial
distribution of vortices. By explicitly including a Magnus force in the
Langevin equations of motion we induce a Hall field and we find that the
effective Hall angle is strongly reduced by the formation of channels, i.e. the
channels introduce a transverse energy barrier that guides the motion,
predominantly in a direction parallel to the external force. The transverse
depinning force is larger than the depinning force in the direction of the drag
and thus the Hall field actually vanishes at finite velocities. We propose that
the Hall angle can serve as an order parameter for experimental detection of
the glass to crystal transition. Our results are in excellent agreement with
recent predictions made by Giamarchi and Le Doussal (cond-mat/9512006).

bound-state equations from four-dimensional ones. Unlike ``quasi-potential
approaches'' this procedure does not involve the use of delta-function
constraints on the relative four-momentum. In the absence of negative-energy
states, the kernels of the three-dimensional equations derived by this
technique may be represented as sums of time-ordered perturbation theory
diagrams. Consequently, such equations have two major advantages over
quasi-potential equations: they may easily be written down in any Lorentz
frame, and they include the meson-retardation effects present in the original
four-dimensional equation. Secondly, a simple four-dimensional equation with
the correct one-body limit is obtained by a reorganization of the generalized
ladder Bethe-Salpeter kernel. Thirdly, our approach to deriving
three-dimensional equations is applied to this four-dimensional equation, thus
yielding a retarded interaction for use in the three-dimensional bound-state
equation of Wallace and Mandelzweig. The resulting three-dimensional equation
has the correct one-body limit and may be systematically improved upon. The
quality of the three-dimensional equation, and our general technique for
deriving such equations, is then tested by calculating bound-state properties
in a scalar field theory using six different bound-state equations. It is found
that equations obtained using the method espoused here approximate the wave
functions obtained from their parent four-dimensional equations significantly
better than the corresponding quasi-potential equations do.
