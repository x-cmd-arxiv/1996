very cautious in utilizing Type II for distance determinations. However, we
caution that the link between the asphericity of a supernova and the measured
``intrinsic'' polarization is complicated by reflected light from the
circumstellar material and the intervening interstellar material, the so-called
light echo. This effect may contribute more substantially to SN II than to SN
Ia. The tight limits on polarization of SN Ia may constrain progenitor models

based on a model of Thomson or resonance scattering of photons traveling

the supernova light by a dusty circumstellar material (CSM), or the ``light
echo'' effect. At a given epoch after the explosion, the observed photons
consist of both those propagating directly from the supernova and those
scattered by dust particles in the CSM. Polarized light can be produced if the
distribution of the dust particles is aspherical. The model can reproduce both
the time evolution of the observed broad band polarization of SN 1987A and
major features of the polarization spectra. It is also successful in providing
a natural model for the early infrared light curve, in particular the observed
30 day delay of the IR maximum compared to the maximum of the bolometric light

those of the nova shells of CP Puppis and T Pyxidis decades after outburst. SN
1987A and the novae are characterized by emission from material with electron
temperatures of only a few hundred degrees Kelvin, and show narrow Balmer
continuum emission and strong emission lines from O$^+$. The Balmer continuum
shape requires the electron temperature in the supernova ejecta to be as low as
500 K on day 1862 and 400 K on day 2210 after outburst. The \OIIUV\ doublet is
surprisingly strong and is plausibly powered by collisional ionization of
neutral oxygen to excited states of O$^+$.

the gravitational field produced by the linear density perturbations present on
a $\Omega\neq 1$ universe can generate anisotropies at low z (these
anisotropies would manifest on large angular scales). However, secondary
anisotropies are inevitably produced during the nonlinear evolution of matter
at late times even in a universe with a standard thermal history. Two effects
associated to this nonlinear phase can give rise to new anisotropies: the
time-varying gravitational potential of nonlinear structures (Rees-Sciama RS
effect) and the inverse Compton scattering of the microwave photons with hot
electrons in clusters of galaxies (Sunyaev-Zeldovich SZ effect). These two
effects can produce distinct imprints on the CMB temperature anisotropy. We

ramifications in a number of other bond-disordered 2D systems. The vortex
Hamiltonian is that of a Coulomb gas in a background of quenched random
dipoles, which is capable of forming either a dielectric insulator or a plasma.

is smaller than a critical value $\sigma_c$, the system is in a phase with
quasi-long-range order at low temperatures, without a reentrance transition.
This conclusion is reached through a nearly exact calculation of the
single-vortex free energy, and a Kosterlitz-type renormalization group analysis
of screening and random polarization effects from vortex-antivortex pairs. The
critical strength of disorder $\sigma_c$ is found not to be universal, but
generally lies in the range $0<\sigma_c<\pi/8$. Argument is presented to
suggest that the system at $\sigma>\sigma_c$ does not possess long-range glassy
order at any finite temperature. In the ordered phase, vortex pairs undergo a
series of spatial and angular localization processes as the temperature is
lowered. This behavior, which is common to many glass-forming systems, can be
quantified through approximate mappings to the random energy model and to the
directed polymer on the Cayley tree. Various critical properties at the
order-disorder transition are calculated.

universe in terms of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian defined on the universe.
We concentrate only on one specific problem along this line: To introduce a
concept of distance between universes in terms of the difference in the
spectra.
  We can find out such a measure of closeness from a general discussion. The
basic properties of this `spectral distance' are then investigated. It can be
related to a reduced density matrix element in quantum cosmology. Thus,
calculating the spectral distance gives us an insight for the quantum
theoretical decoherence between two universes. The spectral distance does not
in general satisfy the triangular inequality, illustrating that it is not
equivalent to the distance defined by the DeWitt metric on the superspace.
  We then pose a question: Whether two universes with different topologies
interfere with each other quantum mechanically? We concentrate on the
difference in the orientabilities. Several concrete models in 2-dimension are
set up, and the spectral distances between them are investigated: Tori and
Klein's bottles, spheres and real projective spaces. Quite surprisingly, we
find many cases of spaces with different orientabilities in which the spectral
distance turns out to be very short. It may suggest that, without any other
special mechanism, two such universes interfere with each other quite strongly.

adding additional counterterms to the operator and adjusting these order by

are consequences of the physical motion of stuck open strings along the D-brane

abelian factor for which the chiral matter content of the theory is anomalous
$\sum_{f} q^f_A \neq 0 \neq \sum_{f} (q^f_A)^3$ ; ii) a nonanomalous factor
$G$. In these models, the calculation of consistent gauge anomalies usually
found in the literature as a solution to the Zumino-Stora descent equations is
reconsidered. Another solution of the descent equations that differs on the
terms involving mixed gauge anomalies is presented on this paper. The origin of
their difference is analysed, and using Fujikawa's formalism the second result
is argued to be the divergence of the usual chiral current. Invoking
topological arguments the physical equivalence of both solutions is explained,
but only the second one can be technically called the consistent anomaly of a
classically invariant theory. The first one corresponds to the addition of
noninvariant local counterterms to the action. A consistency check of their
physical equivalence is performed by implementing the four dimensional string
inspired Green-Schwarz mechanism for both expressions. This is achieved adding
slightly different anomaly cancelling terms to the original action, whose
difference is precisely the local counterterms mentioned before. The complete
anomaly free action is therefore uniquely defined, and the resulting
constraints on the spectrum of fermion charges are the same. The Lorentz
invariance of the fermion measure in four dimensions forces the Lorentz
variation of the Green-Schwarz terms to cancel by itself, producing an
additional constraint usually overlooked in the literature. This often happens
when a dual description of the theory is used without including all local
counterterms.

discussed in the context of experimental data obtained in measurements recently
done on LEAR utility at CERN. Another quantity which characterizes the
deviation of the average nuclear densities ratio from the corresponding ratio
of the homogeneous densities is introduced too. It was shown that it is also a
good indicator of the neutron halo. The results are compared to experimental

measurements carried out at definite moments of time. However, realistic
measurements do not take place in an instant, but are extended over a period of
time. The assumption of instantaneous alternatives in usual quantum mechanics
is an approximation whose validity can be investigated in the generalized
quantum mechanics of closed systems in which probabilities are predicted for
spacetime alternatives that extend over time. In this paper we investigate how
alternatives extended over time reduce to the usual instantaneous alternatives
in a simple model in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show
how the decoherence of a particular set of spacetime alternatives becomes
automatic as the time over which they extend approaches zero and estimate how
large this time can be before the interference between the alternatives becomes
non-negligible. These results suggest that the time scale over which coarse
grainings of such quantities as the center of mass position of a massive body
may be extended in time before producing significant interference is much
longer than characteristic dynamical time scales.
