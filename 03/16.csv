  To be published in Proc. ""Science with the HST - II""",,,"Astron. Inst. Basel Preprint 88","astro-ph",,"  HST has so far provided Cepheid distances to nine galaxies. Although not
sufficient yet to determine the distance of the extended Virgo cluster, they
are decisive for the distance scale in two ways. (1) Seven of the galaxies
contribute to a much improved calibration of the Tully-Fisher relation.
Applying this to a complete sample of Virgo spirals one obtains a cluster
distance of (m-M)=31.79 +/- 0.09. Other distance indicators support this value.
The adopted linear distance of 22.0 +/- 0.8 Mpc combined with the cluster
velocity of 1178 +/- 32 km s^-1 (in the CMB frame) gives H_0=54 +/- 2 (internal
error). (2) Six of the galaxies have been the site of seven SNe Ia with well
observed maxima. Their resulting calibration in absolute magnitudes gives
M_B(max)=-19.53 +/- 0.07 and M_V(max)=-19.49 +/- 0.07 with negligible intrinsic
scatter. If this calibration is used to determine the distances of all distant
SNe Ia with known maxima and with 1100 < v < 30'000 km s^-1, H_0 becomes 56 +/-
3 (internal error). Systematic errors tend to make this an upper limit; in
particular the case H_0 >= 70 can be excluded.
  The conclusion is that the large-scale value of the Hubble constant is H_0=55
+/- 10 (external error).

of about $10^{13}$G. However, controversy has risen over whether a lower field
scenario may account for the alleged absence or weakness of a lower energy
fundamental harmonic feature. This work explores these two alternatives through
the generation of theoretical cyclotron spectra. For lower field models, a
cylindrical geometry of the line forming region and the strong angle dependence
of the cross section for resonant scattering conspire to fill in a first
harmonic at around 57 keV. Higher field models (B $\simeq$ 10.75 TG), however,
yield significantly better fits (${\cal X}^2_{low}/{\cal X}^2_{high} \sim 71$),
thus strengthening the case for a near-critical field ($B_{crit} \simeq 44$
TG). Phase-resolved OSSE spectra are not yet available but would greatly help
in resolving this issue.

maintaining the slow rotation of classical disk-accreting T Tauri stars.
Current estimates for the frequency and duration of FU Orionis outbursts and
the mass accretion rates of T Tauri and FU Orionis stars suggest that more mass
may be accreted during the outbursts than during the T Tauri phases. If this is
the case, then the outbursts should also dominate the accretion of angular
momentum. During the outbursts, the accretion rate is so high that the magnetic
field of the star should not disrupt the disk, and the disk will extend all the
way in to the stellar surface. Standard thin disk models then predict that the
star should accrete large amounts of angular momentum, which will produce a
secular spinup of the star. We present boundary layer solutions for FU Orionis
parameters which show that the angular momentum accretion rate drops below zero
for stellar rotation rates which are always substantially below breakup, but
depend on the mass accretion rate and on the adopted definition of the stellar
radius. When the angular momentum accretion rate drops close to zero, the star
will stop spinning up. Faster stellar rotation rates will produce negative
angular momentum accretion which will spin the star down. Therefore, FU Orionis
outbursts can keep the stellar rotation rate close to some equilibrium value
for which the angular momentum accretion rate is small. We show that this
equilibrium rotation rate may be similar to the observed rotation rates of T
Tauri stars; thus we propose that FU Orionis outbursts may be responsible for
the observed slow rotation of T Tauri stars. This mechanism is independent of
whether the disk is disrupted by the stellar magnetic field during the T Tauri
phase.

Ly$\alpha$, and the DI column by its saturation, leading to a 95\% confidence

Rindler-like space-time is investigated within the conical Euclidean approach
in the manifold $C_\be\times\M^N$, $C_\be$ being the 2-dimensional cone, making
use of the zeta-function regularisation. Due to the presence of conical
singularities, it is shown that the relation between the zeta-function and the
heat kernel is non trivial and, as first pointed out by Cheeger, requires a
separation between small and large eigenvalues of the Laplace operator. As a
consequence, in the massless case, the (naive) non existence of the Mellin
transform is by-passed by the Cheeger's analytical continuation of the
zeta-function on manifold with conical singularities. Furthermore, the
continuous spectrum leads to the introduction of smeared traces. In general, it
is pointed out that the presence of the divergences may depend on the smearing
function and they arise in removing the smearing cutoff. With a simple choice
of the smearing function, horizon divergences in the thermodynamical quantities
are recovered and these are similar to the divergences found by means of
off-shell methods like the brick wall model, the optical conformal
transformation techniques or the canonical path integral method.

study of the purely elastic boundary reflection matrix $K_a(\theta)$ for
integrable quantum field theory defined on a space-time with a boundary.
However, general structure of that principle in the form as was originally
introduced by Fring and K\""oberle has remained unclear. In terms of a new
matrix $J_a(\theta)=\sqrt{K_a(\theta)/K_{\bar{a}}(i\pi +\theta)}$, the boundary
bootstrap takes a simple form. Incidentally, a hypothesised expression of the
boundary reflection matrix for simply-laced $ADE$ affine Toda field theory
defined on a half line with the Neumann boundary condition is obtained in terms
of geometrical quantities of root systems \`a la Dorey.

due to nuclear effects in the deuteron. At small x, the F_2D/F_2p ratio
measured by the New Muon and Fermilab E665 Collaborations is interpreted to
suggest a small amount of shadowing in deuterium, which acts to enhance F_2^n
for x < 0.1. A careful treatment of Fermi motion, binding and nucleon off-shell
effects in the deuteron also indicates that the neutron/proton structure
function ratio as x -> 1 is consistent with the perturbative QCD expectation of
3/7, but larger than the traditional value of 1/4.
