Virgo cluster is presented in an attempt to use the frequency and spatial
distribution of galaxies with specific morphological features to study the
efficiency of various environmental effects on the evolution of disk galaxies
in clusters. The velocity distribution of the barred spirals in the Virgo
region is clearly different than that of the nonbarred spirals, suggesting that
barred spirals are more common in the main condensation of the cluster. A
sample cleansed of galaxies not belonging to the main cluster condensation
using the subcluster assignments of Binggeli et al. [A&AS, 98, 275 (1993)]
bears this out, showing that the radial distribution of barred spirals is more
centrally condensed than that of nonbarred spirals. In contrast to the spiral
galaxies, the distribution of barred S0 galaxies is statistically
indistinguishable from that of nonbarred S0's. Consideration of the level of
tidal perturbation due to the cluster mass distribution as compared to that due
to individual galaxies suggests that tidal triggering by the cluster mass
distribution is the most likely source of the enhanced fraction of barred
spirals in the cluster center.

The time and dimensional analysis of the vacuum instability is presented. It is
shown that the distributions of particles created by quasiconstant electric
fields can be written in a form which has a thermal character and seems to be
universal. Its application, for example, to the particles creation in external
constant gravitational field reproduces the Hawking temperature exactly.

vortices of the abelian Higgs model is developed. A static vortex is
asymptotically identical to a solution of the linearized field theory (a
Klein-Gordon/Proca theory) in the presence of a singular point source at the
vortex centre. It is shown that this source is a composite scalar monopole and
magnetic dipole, and the respective charges are determined numerically for
various values of the coupling constant. The interaction potential of two well
separated vortices is computed by calculating the interaction Lagrangian of two
such point sources in the linear theory. The potential is used to model type II
vortex scattering.

relativistic mean-field approximation to the nuclear matter energy functional.
Based on ideas of effective field theory, nonlinear interactions between the
fields are introduced to parametrize the density dependence of the energy
functional. Various types of nonlinearities involving scalar-isoscalar
($\sigma$), vector-isoscalar ($\omega$), and vector-isovector ($\rho$) fields
are studied. After calibrating the model parameters at equilibrium nuclear
matter density, the model and parameter dependence of the resulting equation of
state is examined in the neutron-rich and high-density regime. It is possible
to build different models that reproduce the same observed properties at normal
nuclear densities, but which yield maximum neutron star masses that differ by
more than one solar mass. Implications for the existence of kaon condensates or
quark cores in neutron stars are discussed.
