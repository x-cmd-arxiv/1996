Standard BBN (N_nu =3) and allows N_nu \leq 3.6 at 95% C.L., but is

N_nu = 1.9 +/- 0.3 at 68% C.L., excluding Standard BBN at 99.9% C.L., unless
the systematic uncertainties in the 4He observations have been underestimated

nebula that has been photoionised by the quasar, but an additional component of
continuum light -perhaps quasar light scattered from dust in the companion

explain the observations. These observations may be indicative of the first

Type Ia supernovae played an important role, heating the gas in dwarf

cooling flow clusters we propose a model relevant to plasmas with comparable
thermal and magnetic pressures. Magnetic field reconnection may play a major
role in changing the topology of the magnetic field in the central cooling flow
regions. The effect of the topology change is that cool flux loops can
reconnect to hot flux loops that are connected to the overall thermal reservoir
of the cluster. There can be a rapid recycling of mass between hot and cold
phases on a time scale of 3 x 10^8-10^9 yr which may reduce the inferred inflow
and mass condensation rates by at least an order of magnitude. A central
multiphase medium is a direct consequence of such a model. Throughout the
cooling flow the filling factor of the hot loops (T > 2 x 10^7 K) is of order
unity. The filling factor of the cool loops (T < 2 x 10^7 K) is 0.1-1% with a
corresponding mass fraction of cold phase of 1-10%. A crucial parameter is the
coherence length of the field relative to the cooling radius and the
distribution of field energy with scale. When the cooling radius is greater
than the field coherence length then cooling flows proceed as usual. When the
coherence length is greater than the central cooling radius, however, the
thermal energy of the reservoir can be tapped and the mass condensation rates
may be very significantly reduced. Three additional conditions must be
satisfied: I. Cold loops must be able to fall at least as far as the mean
distance between hot loops in a cooling time; II. Loops must enter an
evaporative phase on reconnecting; and III. A sufficient number of hot loops
penetrate the cold phase region to power the radiative losses.

1 galaxy Mrk 766 are reported. In the ASCA observation we observed rapid
variability with a doubling time scale of 1000 seconds. A spectral variability
event was observed in which the spectrum softened and hardened above and below
~1 keV, respectively, as the flux increased. The spectra could be modeled with
5 components: a power law, warm absorber, iron K(alpha) line and soft excess
component flux. The spectral variability resulted from a highly significant
change in the intrinsic photon law index from Gamma ~1.6 to ~2.0, an increase
in the warm absorber ionization, and a marginally significant decrease in the
soft component normalization. A ~100 eV equivalent width narrow iron K(alpha)
line was detected in the high state spectrum. Spectral hardening during flux
increases was observed in three ROSAT observations.
  The change in intrinsic photon index and disappearance of the soft excess
component in the ASCA spectra can be explained as a transition from a first
order pair reprocessed spectrum to a pair cascade brought about by a sudden
increase in the injected electron Lorentz factor. The change in the ionization
of the warm absorber, though model dependent, could correspond to the increase
in flux at the oxygen edges resulting from the spectral index change. The ROSAT
spectral variability can be interpreted by variable intensity hard power law
and a relatively nonvarying soft component, possibly primary disk emission.
These results are compared with those reported from other narrow-line Seyfert 1
galaxies.

detect the presence of bulk non-circular motion or elliptical orbits. In a disk
galaxy with both a radial color gradient and non-circular motion, isochromes or
iso-color contours should follow the shape of closed stellar orbits, and the
ellipticity of the isophotes should vary as a function of wavelength. A
difference in the ellipticity of isochromes and the isophotes can be used to
detect the presence of non-circular motion. A model galaxy is constructed which
demonstrates this phenomenon. The difference between isochrome and isophote
ellipticity is directly related to the ellipticity of the potential. This
provides a new way to measure the ellipticity of the dark matter in the outer
parts of galaxies.
  As an example, we apply this technique to two dwarf galaxies NGC 1800 and NGC
7764. We detect a bar in NGC 1800 which has only previously been suggested from
the HI velocity field. In NGC 7764 there is no color gradient along its bar so
we cannot detect non-circular motion in this region; however ellipticities
observed in a star forming ring at the end of the bar are consistent with this
ring being located near the corotation resonance.

such models are studied on (2+1)-dimensional Minkowski space. If the dynamics
of the gauge fields is governed by a Maxwell term the appropriate potential is
a sum of generalised Higgs potentials known as Fayet-Iliopoulos D-terms. Many
interesting topological solitons of Bogomol'nyi type arise in models of this
kind, including various types of vortices (e.g. Nielsen-Olesen, semilocal and
superconducting vortices) as well as, in certain limits, textures (e.g.
CP^(m-1) textures and gauged CP^(m-1) textures). This is explained and general
results about the spectrum of topological defects both for broken and partially
broken gauge symmetry are proven. When the dynamics of the gauge fields is
governed by a Chern-Simons term instead of a Maxwell term a different scalar
potential is required for the theory to be of Bogomol'nyi type. The general
form of that potential is given and a particular example is discussed.

target space theory describes the world-volume dynamics of 2+2 dimensional

particular vacua of the N=(2,1) string: Type IIA/B strings and supermembranes
arise in the standard moduli space of toroidal compactifications, while type
${\rm I}'$ and heterotic strings arise from a $\bf Z_2$ orbifold of the N=2
algebra. Yet another vacuum describes M-theory on a ${\bf T}^5/{\bf Z}_2$
orientifold, the type I string on $ {\bf T}^4$, and the six-dimensional
self-dual string. We find that open membranes carry `Chan-Paton fields' on

Born-Infeld effective dynamics of the Dirichlet two-brane in the presence of a

interplay between linear and anti-linear operations on spinor fields and on the
other hand simple linear reflections of the Minkowski space. We define
operations for T, CP and CPT leading to both kinds of actions. These operations
extend the action of SL(2,C), representing the action of the proper
orthochronous Lorentz group SO^+(1,3) on the Weyl spinors, to an action of the
full group O(1,3). But it is more instructive to reverse the arguments. The
action of O(1,3) is the natural way how SL(2,C) together with its conjugation
structure acts on Minkowski space.
  Focusing on the symmetries of these (anti-)linear operations we can for
example distinguish between CP-invariant and CP-violating symmetries. This is
important if gauge symmetries are included. It turns out that, contrary to the
general belief, CP and T are not compatible with SU(n) for n > 2, especially
with colour-SU(3) or with the U(3)-Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix.
