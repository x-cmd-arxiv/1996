the photodissociation region near theta1C is 175 - 220 K, the density is
greater than 2x10 ^5 cm-3, and the hydrogen column density is about 1.5x10 ^22
cm-2. A somewhat lower temperature and column density are found in the IRc2
region, most likely reflecting the smaller UV flux. The observed width of the O
I line is 6.8 km/s (FWHM) at theta1C, which is slightly broadened over the
intrinsic linewidth by optical depth effects. No significant other differences
between the O I and C II line profiles are seen, which shows that the narrow
emission from both neutral atomic oxygen and ionized carbon comes from the PDR.
The O I data do not rule out the possibility of weak broad-velocity emission
from shock-excited gas at IRc2, but the C II data show no such effect, as
expected from non-ionizing shock models.

significantly large, being grossly of the same order of magnitude as the
previous 2PN order, but opposite in sign. However finite mass effects at 2.5PN

mass relation $m_t/m_b=v_u/v_d$ is recovered when $G_W=0$; and another special
relation $m_t/m_b=G_E/G_W$ appears when $v_d=0$, where $G_{E,W}$ are Yukawa
coupling constants and $v_{u,d}$ are VEVs. To facilitate this discussion, a set
of $O(10)$ $\gamma$- matrices is offered based on a physical representation of
the spinors and that of the vector of the $SO(10)$ group. Flavor changing
neutral currents in such models are also discussed.

studied in pure gauge theories of the Maxwell type in 2+1D. These states are
usually unphysical because of the subsidiary condition imposed on the physical
subspace by Gauss' law. A dual Maxwell theory which possesses a topological
electric charge is introduced. Pure Electrodynamics lies in the sector where
the topological charge identically vanishes. Charge bearing operators fully
expressed in terms of the gauge field, however, can create physical states in
the nontrivial topological sectors which thereby generalize QED. An order
disorder structure exists relating the charged operators and the magnetic flux
creating (vortex) operators, both through commutation rules and correlation
functions. The relevance of this structure for bosonization in 2+1D is
discussed.
