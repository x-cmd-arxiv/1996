similar samples belonging to the Cambridge-Cambridge ROSAT Serendipity Survey

given optical luminosity, the typical X-ray luminosity of NELGs is about one or
two orders of magnitude higher than that of normal galaxies; b) the ratio of
the surface density of NELGs compared with BLAGN increases from about 0.04 at
fx >= 6 x 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} to about 0.1 at fx >= 10^{-14} erg

very close to that of BLAGN at fx ~ 10^{-15} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}; c) we find
that these objects are described by a cosmological evolution rate similar to
that of soft X-ray selected BLAGN; d) the de-evolved (z=0) XLF of NELGs in the
luminosity range 10^{41} - 5 x 10^{43} erg s^{-1} is steeper than the BLAGN

significantly lower than the spatial density of X-ray selected BLAGN at Lx(z=0)

of the emission in the soft X-ray band (Finley et al. 1992). In addition, we
find strong evidence of a harder component, described equally well with a
blackbody at T about 2x10^6 K, or with a steep power law with photon index
Gamma about 4.5. This bimodal emission is also supported by an analysis of the
light curve shape as a function of the energy. The 0.1--2.4 keV light curve of
PSR 0656+14, with a pulsed fraction of about 9%, is interpreted with a simple
model for the temperature distribution on the neutron star surface, coupled
with the geometrical information derived from radio data. In this model, which
includes the effects of relativistic light bending and gravitational redshift,
the X--rays originate from two thermal components resulting from neutron star
cooling and blackbody emission released in the hotter polar cap regions. The
observed modulation can be reproduced only if PSR 0656+14 has a relatively high
dipole inclination (about 30 deg) and (1+z) is less than about 1.15. The
overall pulsed fraction cannot be significantly increased by including the
polar cap contribution, if its temperature and intensity are to be consistent

produced by hybridization between planes and chains, the order parameter
changes sign on a single sheet of the Fermi surface resulting in nodes in the

d-wave models. One reason is that impurities produce essentially plane-plane

$T_{c } $ is reduced by plane-chain scattering, which is smaller by a factor of
order hybridization coupling over Fermi energy. In the specific case which we

a further reduction of the sensitivity of $T_{c}$ to impurities with a
behaviour which can vary continuously from s-wave like to d-wave like depending

  The radiative corrections from the Yukawa couplings of the third generation
are found to dominate over the contributions from charginos and neutralinos.
  Large Higgs mass uncertainties are due to the top mass uncertainty and the

of the lightest Higgs is found to be below 103 GeV for a top mass below 190
GeV. The cross section at a LEP energy of 192 GeV is sufficient to find or

to predict the low energy gauge couplings and masses of the 3. generation
particles from a few parameters at the GUT scale. In addition the MSSM predicts
elektroweak symmetry breaking due to large radiative corrections from Yukawa
couplings, thus relating the Z^0 boson mass to the top quark mass. From a
\chi^2 analysis, in which these constraints can be considered simultaneously,
one can calculate the probability for each point in the MSGUT parameter space.
Our fits include full second order corrections for the gauge and Yukawa
couplings, low energy treshold effects, contributions of all (s)particles to
the Higgs potential and corrections to m_b from qluinos and higgsinos, which
exclude (in our notation) positive values of the mixing parameter in the Higgs
potential \mu for the large tan \beta region. Further constraints can be
derived from the branching ratio for the radiative (penguin) decay of the
b-quark into s \gamma and the lower limit on the lifetime of the universe,
which requires the dark matter density due to the Lightest Supersymmetric
Particle (LSP) not to overclose the universe. For particles, which are most
likely to have masses in the LEP II energy range, the cross sections are given
for the various energy scenarios at LEP II. For low tan \beta the production of
the lightest Higgs boson, which is expected to have a mass below 103 GeV, is
the most promising channel, while for large tan \beta the production of
charginos and/or neutralinos covers the preferred parameter space.

theories in four dimensions with gauge groups G of rank r>1 and matter
multiplets. Special emphasis is put on G=SU(3) and those matter contents that
yield perturbatively finite theories. There is no direct interpretation of the
soliton spectra in terms of naive selfduality under strong--weak coupling and
exchange of electric and magnetic charges. We argue that, in general, the
standard procedure of finding the dyon spectrum will not give results that
support a conventional selfduality hypothesis --- the SU(2) theory with four
fundamental hypermultiplets seems to be an exception. Possible interpretations
of the results are discussed.

multi-field theories are investigated. Particular attention is devoted to the
interplay between temperature effects, ultraviolet structure, and the
interdependence of the gap equations. Results are presented explicitly in the
case of the evaluation of the finite temperature effective potential of a
theory with two scalar fields which has attracted interest as a toy model for
symmetry nonrestoration at high temperatures. The lowest nontrivial order of
approximation of the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective potential is shown to
lead to consistent results, which are relevant for recent studies of symmetry
nonrestoration by Bimonte and Lozano.

viewed as a prediction for the infinite family of constants F_n measuring the
n-instanton contribution to the prepotential F. Here we examine the instanton
physics directly, in particular the contribution of the general self-dual
solution of topological charge n constructed by Atiyah, Drinfeld, Hitchin and
Manin (ADHM). In both the bosonic and supersymmetric cases, we determine both
the large- and short-distance behavior of all the fields in this background.
This allows us to construct the exact classical interaction between n ADHM
(super-)instantons mediated by the adjoint Higgs. We calculate the one- and
two-instanton contributions to the low-energy Seiberg-Witten effective action,
and find precise agreement with their predicted values of F_1 and F_2.

$X_1,...,X_k$ and $X_{k+1},...,X_n$ are equal to the joint distributions of
$Y_1,...,Y_k$ and $Y_{k+1},...,Y_n,$ respectively, but $Y_i$ and $Y_j$ are
independent for every $1\le i \le k,\ k+1\le j \le n.$
  We prove that $\Bbb E (f(X)) \ge \Bbb E (f(Y))$ where $f$ is any continuous,
positive, homogeneous of the order $p\in (-n,0)$ function on $\Bbb R^n\setminus
\{0\}$ such that $f$ is a positive definite distribution in $\Bbb R^n,$ and
$f(u,v)=f(u,-v)$ for every $u\in \Bbb R^k,\ v\in \Bbb R^{n-k}.$

presented. The spectroscopic factors determined from the former reaction are
used to fix the magnitude of the knockout contribution to the (gamma, p)
reaction at 60 MeV. The results obtained for several nuclei indicate that the
knockout contributions are much larger in magnitude and hence closer to the
data than predicted in an earlier comparison based on non-relativistic
calculations. We discuss the sensitivity of the results to the choice of
parameters for the binding and final state interactions. We find these
uncertainties to be more pronounced at the larger missing momenta explored by
the (gamma, p) reaction. The implications of the present results for the size
of contributions due to meson exchange currents are discussed.
