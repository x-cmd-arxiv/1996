  A&A",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We describe a search for molecular absorption at millimetre wavelengths
associated with dusty molecular tori in active galactic nuclei (AGN). The
sample observed consists of 11 flat-spectrum radio sources known to have red
optical to infra-red colours plus two steep-spectrum narrow-line radio
galaxies. Spectra of the sources were obtained in the 3-, 2- and 1.3-millimetre
bands at frequencies corresponding to common molecular transitions of CO, HCO+,
HCN and CS at the AGN redshift. No absorptions were detected in any of the
sources. We calculated upper limits to the column density in molecular
absorption, using an excitation temperature of 10 K, to be N(CO) < 10^{15} -
10^{16} cm^-2, equivalent to hydrogen columns of order N(H) < 10^{19} - 10^{20}
cm^-2.
  These limits are significantly lower than the values N(H) \approx (2 - 6)
10^{21} cm^-2 that might be expected if the red colours of these sources were
due to dust absorption at the quasar redshift as suggested by Webster et al.
(1995). Should the excitation temperature of the molecular transitions be
higher than 100K, the upper limits to the H2 column densities would be greater
than those derived from the red colours. To explain the lack of molecular
absorption we conclude that either the optical extinction takes place outside
the host galaxy (along the line of sight), or the excitation temperature of the
molecular transitions is very high, or the obscuration is not associated with
significant amounts of cold molecular gas. It is quite possible that the hard
X-ray flux from the central source of these AGN is strong enough to
photo-dissociate the molecules.

  Dimension","20 pages, LaTeX, submitted to Phys. Rev. E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.54.1497",,"chao-dyn nlin.CD",,"  We establish exact inequalities for the structure-function scaling exponents
of a passively advected scalar in both the inertial-convective and
viscous-convective ranges. These inequalities involve the scaling exponents of
the velocity structure functions and, in a refined form, an intermittency
exponent of the convective-range scalar flux. They are valid for 3D
Navier-Stokes turbulence and satisfied within errors by present experimental
data. The inequalities also hold for any ``synthetic'' turbulent velocity
statistics with a finite correlation in time. We show that for time-correlation
exponents of the velocity smaller than the ``local turnover'' exponent, the
scalar spectral exponent is strictly less than that in Kraichnan's soluble
``rapid-change'' model with velocity delta-correlated in time. Our results
include as a special case an exponent-inequality derived previously by
Constantin \& Procaccia [Nonlinearity {\bf 7} 1045 (1994)], but with a more
direct proof. The inequalities in their simplest form follow from a
Kolmogorov-type relation for the turbulent passive scalar valid in each space
dimension $d.$ Our improved inequalities are based upon a rigorous version of
the refined similarity hypothesis for passive scalars. These are compared with
the relations implied by ``fusion rules'' hypothesized for scalar gradients.

current response is delayed by the large time $t_E = \lambda^{-1} |\ln \hbar|$,
where $\lambda$ is the Lyapunov exponent. In the semiclassical regime $t_E$ is
much larger than the transport lifetime. Thus, the fundamental characteristic
of the classical chaotic motion, Lyapunov exponent, may be found by measuring
the frequency or temperature dependence of WLC.

DOS persists even at electron energies exceeding the inverse transport
relaxation time, which could not be expected from the well-known
Altshuler-Aronov-Lee (AAL) theory. This correction originates from the
interference between the electron waves scattered by an impurity and by the
Friedel oscillation this impurity creates. Account for such processes also
revises the AAL formula for the DOS in the diffusive limit.

gauge fields are defined on the lattice only, but are interpolated to the
interior of the lattice cells, where they couple to continuum fermions. The
purpose of this approach is to avoid doublers and keep the chiral symmetry of
the action intact. In two dimensional models (Schwinger model and chiral
Schwinger model) many results for this hybrid approach can be obtained
analytically. For the vectorlike Schwinger model we concentrate on proving the
existence of a critical point where the continuum limit can be constructed, on
analyzing the chiral properties and on proving the Osterwalder-Schrader
positivity which allows the reconstruction of the physical Hilbert space. We
conclude with outlining how the results can be generalized to the chiral
Schwinger model.
