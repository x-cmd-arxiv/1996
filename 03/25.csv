wavelength measurements of a sample of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo cluster
described in paper I. Our main goal is to test how star formation inducing
mechanisms depend on several parameters of the galaxies, such as morphological
type and hydrogen content. We derive the star formation rate and star formation
histories of the galaxies, and check their dependence on other parameters.
  Comparison of the sample galaxies with population synthesis models shows that
these objects have significantly lower metallicity than the Solar value. The
colors can generally be explained as a combination of two different stellar
populations: a young (3--20 Myr) population which represents the stars
currently forming, and an older (0.1--1 Gyr) population of previous stellar
generations. This is consistent with the explanation that star formation in
this type of objects takes place in short bursts followed by long quiescent
periods.
  No significant relation is found between the star formation properties of the
sample galaxies and their hydrogen content. Apparently, when star formation
occurs in bursts, other parameters influence the star formation properties more
significantly than the amount of hydrogen. No correlation is found between the
projected Virgocentric distance and the rate of star formation in the galaxies.

and the near universality of the FIR/radio correlation for late-type field
galaxies. We develop theoretical models for the radio and far-infrared (FIR)
emission of normal galaxies and study the influence of their main parameters on
the ratio of the two emissions. In addition, data are used from a sample of 114
late-type galaxies which allow an estimate of the mean energy densities of the
radiation field and the magnetic field, and of the dust opacity. These data
reveal, for the first time, a reasonably good, linear correlation between the
energy density of the radiation field and the energy density of the magnetic
field. Furthermore we find that on average the galaxies are marginally
optically thick for the non-ionizing UV light. Including their extended
magnetic halos, galaxies are also found to be on average marginally optically
thick regarding the radiative energy losses of the Cosmic Ray electrons.
Combining these semi-empirical results with the theoretical emission models we
show that in the optically thick case the linear correlation between the energy
densities of the radiation field and the magnetic field is a necessary
condition for the existence of the observed FIR/radio correlation. Furthermore
we show that the individual dispersion of the FIR to radio continuum ratio
caused by uncertainties of any single one of the parameters considered is
significantly less than the empirical dispersion of the FIR/radio correlation.
The radio and the FIR emission are mainly determined by their sources, i.e.
massive supernova precursor stars, because galaxies act in a reasonable
approximation as calorimeters for the stellar UV radiation and for the energy
flux of the Cosmic Ray electrons.

when $\alpha \neq 0$, topological symmetry is not broken, but when $\alpha =0$
and solutions of the Einstein equations exist then topological symmetry is
broken. This conditions connect to the Yamabe conjecture. Namely negative
constant scalar curvature exist on manifolds of any topology, but existence of
nonnegative constant scalar curvature is restricted by topology. This fact is
easily seen in this theory. Topological symmetry breaking means that BRS
symmetry breaking in cohomological field theory. But it is found that another

ways of constructing symmetries through an algebraic stepping process using
knotted graphs. The hope is that this may lead to an algebraic formulation of
string theory. In the conclusion I speculate that the stepping process is a
form of quantisation for which the most general form must be sought. By
applying the quantisation step a sufficient number (possibly infinite) of times
we may construct an algebra which is equivalent to its own quantisation.

{\it with ergoregion but no event horizon}. Such complex frequency modes must
be included in the quantization of the field. As a model for this system, we
have investigated a real scalar field with mass $\mu $ in a one-dimensional
square-well potential. If the depth of the potential is greater than $\mu^2$,
then there exist imaginary frequency modes. It is possible to quantize this
simple system, but the mode operators for imaginary frequencies satisfy unusual
commutation relations and do not admit a Fock-like representation or a ground
state. Similar properties have been discussed already by Fulling for a complex
scalar field interacting with an external electrostatic potential. We are
interested in the field dynamics in the physical case where the initial state
of the quantum field is specified before the complex frequency modes develop.
As a model for this, we investigated a free scalar field whose ``mass"" is
normal in the past and becomes ``tachyonic"" in the future. A particle detector
in the far future placed in the in-vacuum state shows non-vanishing excitations
related to the imaginary frequency modes as well. Implications of these results
for the question of vacuum stability near rapidly rotating stars and possible
applications to other fields in physics are discussed briefly.

Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky is a homological construction for the reduction of
the Poisson algebra $P = C^\infty (W)$ of smooth functions on a Poisson
manifold $W$ by the ideal $I$ of functions which vanish on a constraint locus.
This ideal is called first class if $I$ is closed under the Poisson bracket;
geometers refer to the constraint locus as coisotropic. The physicists' model
is crucially a differential Poisson algebra extension of a Poisson algebra $P$;
its differential contains a piece which reinvented the Koszul complex for the
ideal $I$ and a piece which looks like the Cartan-Chevalley-Eilenberg
differential.
  The present paper is concerned purely with the homological (Poisson)
algebraic structures, using the notion of ``model'' from rational homotopy
theory and the techniques of homological perturbation theory to establish some
of the basic results explaining the mathematical existence of the classical
BRST-BFV construction. Although the usual treatment of BFV is basis dependent
(individual constraints) and nominally finite dimensional, I take care to avoid
assumptions of finite dimensionality and work more invariantly in terms of the
ideal. In particular, the techniques are applied to the `irregular' case (the
ideal is not generated by a regular sequence of constraints), although the
geometric interpretation is less complete.

simulations show that when the value of the smoothing parameter is not too
small the coherent phase state distributions can be obtained with sufficiently
well accuracy. With decreasing value of the smoothing parameter the
determination of the coherent phase state distributions may be an effort,
because both the numerical calculation of the sampling function and the

with drastically increasing accuracy.
