Lett., 78, 1452, (1997)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.1452",,"chao-dyn cond-mat hep-th nlin.CD",,"  We consider the tails of probability density functions (PDF) for different
characteristics of velocity that satisfies Burgers equation driven by a
large-scale force. The saddle-point approximation is employed in the path
integral so that the calculation of the PDF tails boils down to finding the
special field-force configuration (instanton) that realizes the extremum of
probability. We calculate high moments of the velocity gradient $\partial_xu$
and find out that they correspond to the PDF with $\ln[{\cal
P}(\partial_xu)]\propto-(-\partial_xu/{\rm Re})^{3/2}$ where ${\rm Re}$ is the
Reynolds number. That stretched exponential form is valid for negative
$\partial_xu$ with the modulus much larger than its root-mean-square (rms)
value. The respective tail of PDF for negative velocity differences $w$ is
steeper than Gaussian, $\ln{\cal P}(w)\sim-(w/u_{\rm rms})^3$, as well as
single-point velocity PDF $\ln{\cal P}(u)\sim-(|u|/u_{\rm rms})^3$. For high
velocity derivatives $u^{(k)}=\partial_x^ku$, the general formula is found:
$\ln{\cal P}(|u^{(k)}|)\propto -(|u^{(k)}|/{\rm Re}^k)^{3/(k+1)}$.

thermalization of carriers in a simplified two-component two-band model of a
semiconductor. The main feature of our approach is the theoretically sound
treatment of collisions. We abandon Fermi's Golden rule in favor of a
nonequilibrium field theoretic formalism as the former is applicable only in
the long-time regime. We also introduce the concept of nonequilibrium dynamical
screening. The dephasing of excitonic quantum beats as a result of
carrier-carrier scattering is brought out. At low densities it is found that
the dephasing times due to carrier-carrier scattering is in picoseconds and not
femtoseconds, in agreement with experiments. The polarization dephasing rates
are computed as a function of the excited carrier density and it is found that
the dephasing rate for carrier-carrier scattering is proportional to the
carrier density at ultralow densities. The scaling relation is sublinear at
higher densities, which enables a comparison with experiment.

B 54, 9756 (1996)","10.1103/PhysRevB.54.9756",,"cond-mat",,"  In this paper we propose a short range generalization of the $p$-spin
interaction spin-glass model. The model is well suited to test the idea that an
entropy collapse is at the bottom-line of the dynamical singularity encountered
in structural glasses. The model is studied in three dimensions through Monte
Carlo simulations, which put in evidence fragile glass behavior with stretched
exponential relaxation and super-Arrhenius behavior of the relaxation time. Our
data are in favor of a Vogel-Fulcher behavior of the relaxation time, related
to an entropy collapse at the Kauzmann temperature. We however encounter
difficulties analogous to those found in experimental systems when
extrapolating thermodynamical data at low temperatures. We study the spin glass
susceptibility investigating the behavior of the correlation length in the
system. We find that the the increase of the relaxation time is not accompanied
by any growth of the correlation length. We discuss the scaling properties of
off-equilibrium dynamics in the glassy regime, finding qualitative agreement
with the mean-field theory.

quantum microstates of the hole which are distinguishable from the hole's
exterior, and which correspond to a given hole's macroscopic configuration. We
compute this number explicitly from first principles, for a Schwarzschild black
hole, using nonperturbative quantum gravity in the loop representation. We
obtain a black hole entropy proportional to the area, as in the
Bekenstein-Hawking formula.
