relaxation in nearly Keplerian star clusters, such as those found in the
centers of galactic nuclei containing massive black holes. The enhanced
relaxation arises because the radial and azimuthal orbital frequencies in a
Keplerian potential are equal, and hence may be termed {\em resonant
relaxation}. We explore the dynamics of resonant relaxation using both
numerical simulations and order-of-magnitude analytic calculations. We find
that the resonant angular momentum relaxation time is shorter than the
non-resonant relaxation time by of order $M_\star/M$, where $M_\star$ is the
mass in stars and $M$ is the mass of the central object. Resonance does not
enhance the energy relaxation rate. We examine the effect of resonant
relaxation on the rate of tidal disruption of stars by the central mass; we
find that the flux of stars into the loss cone is enhanced when the loss cone
is empty, but that the disruption rate averaged over the entire cluster is not
strongly affected. We show that relativistic precession can disable resonant
relaxation near the main-sequence loss cone for black hole masses comparable to
those in galactic nuclei. Resonant dynamical friction leads to growth or decay
of the eccentricity of the orbit of a massive body, depending on whether the
distribution function of the stars is predominantly radial or tangential. The
accelerated relaxation implies that there are regions in nuclear star clusters
that are relaxed in angular momentum but not in energy; unfortunately, these
regions are not well-resolved in nearby galaxies by the Hubble Space Telescope.

discussion of methods for estimating cosmological parameters from large data

in principle. In practice, the data set is so large that both a brute force
likelihood analysis and a direct expansion in signal-to-noise eigenmodes will
be computationally unfeasible. We argue that it is likely that a Karhunen-Loeve

is found to be strongly correlated with that derived from the local geometry of
atoms on the adatom-free surface or step edges. This correlation preserves a
strict correspondence between the barrier determining features in the spatial
variation of the adatom potential energy and the same derived from the local
geometry for the Si(111) surface and the [$\overline{2}11$] step. It is
therefore argued that the Schwoebel barrier on the [$\overline{2}11$] step is
robust {\it i.e.} a feature that would survive in more satisfactory {\it ab

adatom concentration the relevance of the barrier to electromigration of steps

an upper bound on the Schwoebel barrier and a lower bound on the

coalescence has been identified as a computational ``Grand Challenge'' whose
solution is the object of a coordinated effort, just reaching its half-way
point, by more than two-score researchers at nearly a dozen institutions. In
this report I highlight what I see as the most serious problems standing
between us and a general computational solution to the problem of binary black
hole coalescence:
  * the computational burden associated of the problem based on reasonable
extrapolations of present-day computing algorithms and near-term hardware
developments;
  * some of the computational issues associated with those estimates, and how,
through the use of different or more sophisticated computational algorithms we
might reduce the expected burden; and

with density, as if the nucleons were non interacting. The main correction

  In classical mechanics, where $p(\rho,\sigma)=\dl_{\rho\sigma}$, unitarity
  poses no restriction on the Poisson structure. Quantum mechanics is
characterized by a specific (complex Hilbert space) form of $p$, and by the
property that the irreducible components of $P$ as a transition probability
space coincide with the symplectic leaves of $P$ as a Poisson space. In
