an analysis of the strong-coupling expansion of the two-point fundamental
Green's function $G(x)$, calculated up to 21st order on the square lattice,
15th order on the triangular lattice, and 30th order on the honeycomb lattice.
For $N<2$ the critical behavior is of power-law type, and the exponents
$\gamma$ and $\nu$ extracted from our strong-coupling analysis confirm exact
results derived assuming universality with solvable solid-on-solid models. At
$N=2$, i.e., for the 2-$d$ XY model, the results from all lattices considered
are consistent with the Kosterlitz-Thouless exponential approach to
criticality, characterized by an exponent $\sigma=1/2$, and with universality.
The value $\sigma=1/2$ is confirmed within an uncertainty of few per cent. The
prediction $\eta=1/4$ is also roughly verified. For various values of $N\leq
2$, we determine some ratios of amplitudes concerning the two-point function
$G(x)$ in the critical limit of the symmetric phase. This analysis shows that
the low-momentum behavior of $G(x)$ in the critical region is essentially
Gaussian at all values of $N\leq 2$. New exact results for the long-distance
behavior of $G(x)$ when $N=1$ (Ising model in the strong-coupling phase)

particularly attractive, arising naturally from geometrical compactifications

renormalization group running in the E_6 model given one discrete choice of

obtained that allows a clear understanding of the different ``coarse graining''
approximations usually involved in a kinetic description. This method leads to
a systematic perturbative expansion to obtain the kinetic equations including
hard-thermal loop resummation and to an improvement including renormalization,
off-shell effects and contributions that change chemical equilibrium on short
time scales. As a byproduct of these methods we establish the relation between
the relaxation time scale in the linearized equation of motion of the
quasiparticles and the thermalization time scale of the quasiparticle
distribution function in the ``relaxation time approximation''. Hard thermal
loop resummation dramatically modifies the scattering rate for long wavelength
modes as compared to the usual (semi) classical estimate. Relaxation and
kinetics are studied both in the unbroken and broken symmetry phases of the

adsorption of atoms on surfaces is well established, and based on recent
calculations using gradient corrections, it has been shown that it also
describes well the dissociative adsorption of molecules at surfaces -
admittedly however, the data base for reactions at surfaces is still somewhat
small. In the present paper the power of density functional theory calculations
is demonstrated by investigations for two different adsorption systems, namely,
one with a strongly electropositive adsorbate [Na on Al(111)] and one with a
strongly electronegative adsorbate [O on Ru(0001)]. In each case, new hitherto
not expected adsorbate phases have been predicted by the theory: For Na on
Al(111) the stability of a ""four-layer"" surface alloy was identified while for
O on Ru(0001) it was predicted that the formation of a (1 x 1)-O adlayer should
be possible which implies that the apparent saturation coverage of 1/2 is due
to kinetic hindering.
