show that the vertex generating function for a local Lagrangian mapping applied

reproduces nearly exactly the hierarchical amplitudes given by perturbation
theory for gravitational evolution. When extended to smoothed density fields

simulations, examining both the numerics and the general physical properties of
gravitationally driven, hierarchical collapse in a mixed baryonic/dark matter
fluid. We demonstrate that, under certain restrictions, such simulations
converge with increasing resolution to a consistent solution. The dark matter
achieves convergence provided that the relevant scales dominating nonlinear
collapse are resolved. If the gas has a minimum temperature (as expected when
intergalactic gas is heated by photoionization due to the ultraviolet
background) and the corresponding Jeans mass is resolved, then the baryons also
converge. However, if there is no minimum baryonic collapse mass or if this
scale is not resolved, then the baryon results err in a systematic fashion. In
such a case, as resolution is increased the baryon distribution tends toward a
higher density, more tightly bound state. We attribute this to the fact that
under hierarchical structure formation on all scales there is always an earlier
generation of smaller scale collapses, causing shocks which irreversibly alter
the state of the baryon gas. In a simulation with finite resolution we miss
such earlier generation collapses, unless a physical scale is introduced below
which structure formation is suppressed in the baryons. We also find that the
baryon/dark matter ratio follows a characteristic pattern, such that collapsed
structures possess a baryon enriched core (enriched by factors of 2 or more
over the universal average) which is embedded within a dark matter halo, even
without accounting for radiative cooling of the gas. The dark matter is
unaffected by changing the baryon distribution (at least in the dark matter
dominated case investigated here).

the periodic solution which has the spatial driver period undergoes period
doublings as the governing parameter changes. Two types of chaotic behavior are
considered. The first type is a weak chaos, where only a small chaotic
deviation from the periodic solution occurs. The second type corresponds to the
developed chaos where the solution ``ignores'' the driver period and represents
a random sequence of uncorrelated shocks. In the case of weak chaos the shock
coordinate being repeatedly mapped over the driver period moves on a chaotic
attractor, while in the case of developed chaos it moves on a repellor. Both
solutions depend on a parameter indicating the reference shock position in the
shock-train. The structure of a one dimensional set to which this parameter
belongs is investigated. This set contains measure one intervals around the
fixed points in the case of periodic or weakly chaotic solutions and it becomes
a fractal in the case of strong chaos. The capacity dimension of this set is

density fluctuation of the plasmon modes above the plasma frequency form
standing waves across the slab. The spectra below the plasma frequency is
qualitatively different to that of local optics calculations, due to the

In order to cancel the contributions of the fourth generation of quarks to the

group. This model has many features similar to the Standard Model and, for
example, includes a natural generalisation of the Standard Model charge
quantisation rule. We discuss the phenomenology of this model and, in
particular, show that the infrared quasi-fixed point values of the Yukawa
coupling constants put upper limits on the new quark masses close to the

predicted to exist together with the three observed chiral families. The
existence of these two vector--like families turns out to be crucial especially
for an explanation of the inter--family mass--hierarchy and therefore for the
SUSY preon model itself. This paper is devoted to a detailed study of the
expected masses, mixings and decay modes of the vector--like fermions.
Including QCD renormalization--effects, the masses of the vector--like quarks
are expected to lie in the range of 500 GeV to about 2.5 TeV, while those of
the vector--like leptons are expected to be in the range of 200 GeV to 1 TeV.

on the other hand, are incorporated in the guise of spin-1/2 charges acting on
a set of RSOS kinks associated with su(n) at level n. To test the proposed
S-matrix, calculations of the change in the ground-state energy in the presence
of a coupling to a background charge are carried out. The results derived from
the lagrangian using perturbation theory and from the S-matrix using the TBA
are found to be in complete agreement for a variety of background charges which
pick out, in turn, the highest weight states in each of the fundamental
representations of SU(n). In particular, these methods rule out the possibility
of additional CDD factors in the S-matrix. Comparison of the expressions found
for the free-energy also yields an exact result for the mass-gap in these
models: m/Lambda_{MS-bar}=(n/pi)sin(pi/n).

the theory of perfect crystals is presented.
  Let $U_q(\g)$ be a quantum affine algebra. Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional
$U'_q(\g)$-module with a perfect crystal base of level~$l$. Let $V_\aff\simeq
V\otimes\C[z,z^{-1}]$ be the affinization of $V$, with crystal base
$(L_\aff,B_\aff)$. The wedge space $V_\aff\wedge V_\aff$ is defined as the
quotient of $V_\aff\otimes V_\aff$ by the subspace generated by the action of
$U_q(\g)[z^a\otimes z^b +z^b\otimes z^a]_{a,b\in\Z}$ on $v\otimes v$ ($v$ an
extremal vector). The wedge space $\bigwedge^r V_\aff$ ($r\in\N$) is defined
similarly. Normally ordered wedges are defined by using the energy function
$H:B_\aff\otimes B_\aff\to\Z$. Under certain assumptions, it is proved that
normally ordered wedges form a base of $\bigwedge^r V_\aff$.
  A q-deformed Fock space is defined as the inductive limit of $\bigwedge^r
V_\aff$ as $r\to\infty$, taken along the semi-infinite wedge associated to a
ground state sequence. It is proved that normally ordered wedges form a base of
the Fock space and that the Fock space has the structure of an integrable
$U_q(\g)$-module. An action of the bosons, which commute with the
$U'_q(\g)$-action, is given on the Fock space. It induces the decomposition of
the q-deformed Fock space into the tensor product of an irreducible
$U_q(\g)$-module and a bosonic Fock space.
  As examples, Fock spaces for types $A^{(2)}_{2n}$, $B^{(1)}_n$,
$A^{(2)}_{2n-1}$, $D^{(1)}_n$ and $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ at level~1 and $A^{(1)}_1$ at
level~$k$ are constructed. The commutation relations of the bosons in each of
these cases are calculated, using two point functions of vertex operators.
