bundles over a curve (of genus g > 1) has been studied intensely in recent
years and in particular the invariant subring generated by Newstead's
generators alpha, beta, gamma. Several authors have independently found a
minimal complete set of relations for this subring. Their methods are very
different from the methods originally employed by Kirwan to prove Mumford's
conjecture -- that relations derived from the vanishing Chern classes of a
particular rank 2g-1 bundle are a complete set of relations for the entire
cohomology ring. This note contains two theorems which readily follow from
Kirwan's original calculations. We rederive the above result showing that the
first three invariant Mumford relations generate the relation ideal of the
invariant subring. Secondly we prove a stronger version of Mumford's conjecture
and show that the relations coming from the first vanishing Chern class
generate the relation ideal of the entire cohomology ring as a
Q[alpha,beta]-module. (Only a few typos have been amended in this revised
version).

of the unusually high fraction of blue cluster galaxies in distant clusters

colors in interacting Arp galaxies. Comparison between theoretical models and
multicolor diagrams, particularly 4000A break colors, indicates a photometric
signature which differs from both normal disk galaxy star formation and
nonthermal components. This photometric signature is absent for the
Butcher-Oemler galaxies whose general color distribution, compared to
present-day clusters, is consistent with a majority of the blue population
involved in normal star formation rates (spiral-like) with the addition of a
small fraction of bright, blue interacting/merger systems. This photometric

ROSAT/HRI data and reanalyze ROSAT/PSPC data, accounting for the effect of a
varying background to determine the best fit parameters in the $\beta$-model
formalism. We combine the surface brightness fits with two determinations of
the radial temperature profile to determine the total mass. Although there are
slight variations in the total mass determinations introduced by the
uncertainties in the $\beta$-fit, the main contributor to the error arises from
the uncertainties in the temperature determinations. Even though the
morphologies of the dark matter/light and X-ray gas are quite different, we
find that the total mass determined from the X-ray and weak lensing estimates
are consistent with each other within the $2\sigma$ error bars, with the X-ray
inferred mass a factor of $\simeq 2$ larger. However, as the lensing mass
estimates are differential (the surface density at any point is determined
relative to the mean in a control annulus), the shallow, extended nature of the
mass profile biases the lensing inferred mass downwards. We estimate the
correction for this effect and find very good agreement between the corrected
lensing and X-ray results. We determine the gas mass fraction and find $f_g
\simeq 0.07h^{-3/2}$ at all radii and a constant mass-to-light ratio of $M/L_V

algorithm is simply to search for a quintuplet of quasars (over a region of a
few hundred comoving Mpc) which can be seen in two different parts of our past
time cone, allowing for a translation, an arbitrary rotation and possibly a
reflection. This algorithm is demonstrated by application to the distribution
of quasars between redshifts of $z=1$ and $z\approx4,$ i.e., at a comoving
distance from the observer $1700 h^{-1}\mbox{\rm Mpc} \ltapprox d \ltapprox

more than {$300$\hMpc} are found. This is consistent with the number expected
from Monte Carlo simulations in a simply connected Universe if the detailed
anisotropy of sky coverage by the individual quasar surveys is taken into
account. The linear transformation in (flat) comoving space from one quintuplet
to another requires translations of {$353$\hMpc} and {4922\hMpc} respectively,
plus a reflection in the former case, and plus both a rotation and a reflection

liquid in the system is smaller than of the order of the particle size. We show
that the ratio of shear rate to viscosity must be small if one wants to find
size segregation. In this case the particles in the system arrange themselves
in bands of big and small particles oriented along the direction of the flow.
Similarly, in Poiseuille flow we find the formation of particle bands. Here, in
addition, the variety of time scales in the flow leads to an aggregation of
particles in the zones of low shear rate and can suppress size segregation in
these regions. The results have been verified against simulations using a full

It is confirmed that the velocity of a polaron accelerated by a constant
electric field shows a saturation to a velocity close to the sound velocity of
the system, and that the width of a moving polaron decreases as a monotonic
function of the velocity tending to zero at the saturation velocity. The
effective mass of a polaron is estimated to be about one hundred times as heavy
as the bare electron mass. Furthermore the linear mode analysis in the presence
of a polaron is carried out, leading to the conclusion that there is only one
localized mode, i.e. the translational mode. This is confirmed also from the
phase shift of extended modes. There is no localized mode corresponding to the
amplitude mode in the case of the soliton in polyacetylene. Nevertheless the
width of a moving polaron shows small oscillations in time. This is found to be
related to the lowest odd symmetry extended mode and to be due to the finite
size effect.

undergo binary fragmentation and pair annihilation. In the latter, nonlinear
process, fragments react at collision to produce an inert species, causing loss
of mass. We analyse these systems in the reaction-limited regime by solving a
continuous model within the mean-field approximation. The rate of
fragmentation, for a particle of mass $x$ to break into fragments of masses $y$
and $x-y$, has the form $x^{\lambda-1}$ ($\lambda>0$), and the annihilation
rate is constant and independent of the masses of the reactants. We find that
the asymptotic regime is characterized by the annihilation of small-mass
clusters. The results are compared with those for a model with linear mass-loss
(i.e.\ with a sink). We also study more complex models, in which the processes
of fragmentation and annihilation are controlled by mutually-reacting
catalysts. Both pair- and linear-annihilation are considered. Depending on the
specific model and initial densities of the catalysts, the time-decay of the
cluster-density can now be very unconventional and even non-universal. The
interplay between the intervening processes and the existence of a scaling
regime are determined by the asymptotic behaviour of the average-mass and of
the mass-density, which may either decay indefinitely or tend to a constant
value. We discuss further developments of this class of models and their

shown that a lowest-order expansion of the solution reduces to a form similar

results for configurations involving between 2 and 20 compressing planes are

of planes. The shear modulus is also calculated for common lattices and the

investigated numerically for different Wigner-Seitz cells. The response is
softer than harmonic, and depends on the coordination number of the droplet.
Using these results, we propose a new effective inter-droplet potential which
is used to determine the elastic response of a monodisperse collection of
disordered droplets as a function of volume fraction. Our results are in
excellent agreement with recent experiments. This suggests that anharmonicity,
together with disorder, are responsible for the quasi-linear increase of $G$
and $\Pi$ observed at $\varphi_c$.
