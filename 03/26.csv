large number of galaxies with similar morphologies. The data implies that
non-Keplerian fall--off is seen. This implies that (i) large amounts of dark
matter must exist at galactic scales or (ii) that Newtonian gravity must
somehow be corrected. We present a method for inverting the integral relation
between an elemental law of gravity (such as Newton's) and the gravitational
field generated by a thin disk distribution with exponential density. This
allows us to identify, directly from observations, {\it extensions} of
Newtonian gravity with the property of fitting a large class of rotation
curves. The modification is inferred from the observed rotation curve and is
finally written in terms of Newton's constant or the effective potential of a
test mass moving in the field generated by a point-like particle.

dynamical evolution of dark matter halos in galaxy clusters. Our sample
consists of nine massive halos from an EdS universe with scale free power
spectrum and n = -1. Halos are resolved by ~20000 particles each, with a
dynamical resolution of 20-25 kpc. Large scale tidal fields are included up to
L=150 Mpc using background particles. The halo formation process can be
characterized by the alternation of two dynamical configurations: a merging
phase and a relaxation phase, defined by their signature on the evolution of
the total mass and rms velocity. Halos spend on average one 1/3 of their
evolution in the merging phase and 2/3 in the relaxation phase. Using this
definition, we study the density profiles and their change during the halo
history. The average density profiles are fitted by the NFW analytical model
with an rms residual of 17% between the virial radius Rv and 0.01 Rv. The
Hernquist (1990) profiles fits the same halos with an rms residual of 26%. The
trend with mass of the scale radius of these fits is marginally consistent with
that found by Cole & Lacey (1996): in comparison our halos are more centrally
concentrated, and the relation between scale radius and halo mass is slightly
steeper. We find a moderately large scatter in this relation, due both to
dynamical evolution within halos and to fluctuations in the halo population. We
analyze the dynamical equilibrium of our halos using the Jeans' equation, and
find that on average they are approximately in equilibrium within their virial
radius. Finally, we find that the projected mass profiles of our simulated
halos are in very good agreement with the profiles of three rich galaxy
clusters derived from strong and weak gravitational lensing observations.

generates the elastic constants required to stabilise the flat phase. We
present measurements of the size (Flory) exponent $\nu$ and the roughness

weakly nonlinear regimes (for generic choices of parameters) we prove existence
and uniqueness of solutions corresponding to initial data specified before the
dischronal region; however, uniqueness (but not existence) fails in the
strongly coupled regime. The evolution preserves the symplectic structure.
  The quantum theory is approached via the quantum initial value problem
(QIVP); that is, by seeking operator-valued solutions to the equation of motion
with initial data representing the canonical (anti)commutation relations. Using
normal operator ordering, we construct solutions to the QIVP for both Bose and
Fermi statistics (again for generic choice of parameters) and prove that these
solutions are unique. For models with two spatial points, the resulting
evolution is unitary; however, for a more general model the evolution fails to
preserve the (anti)commutation relations and is therefore nonunitary. We show
that this nonunitary evolution cannot be described using a superscattering
operator with the usual properties.
  We present numerical evidence to show that the bosonic quantum theory can
pick out a unique classical limit for certain ranges of the coupling strength,
even when there are many classical solutions. We show that the quantum theory
depends strongly on the choice of operator ordering.
  In addition, we show that our results differ from those obtained using the
``self-consistent path integral''. It follows that the path integral evolution

We find that inclusion of color octet production channels removes large
discrepancies between experiment and the predictions of the color singlet model

contributions accounts for the observed direct to total $J/\psi$ production
ratio. As found earlier for photo-production of quarkonia, a fit to fixed
target data requires smaller color octet matrix elements than those extracted
from high-$p_t$ production at the Tevatron. We argue that this difference can
be explained by systematic differences in the velocity expansion for collider
and fixed-target predictions. While the color octet mechanism thus appears to
be an essential part of a satisfactory description of fixed target data,
important discrepancies remain for the $\chi_{c1}/\chi_{c2}$ production ratio
and $J/\psi$ ($\psi'$) polarization. These discrepancies, as well as, the
differences between pion and proton induced collisions emphasize the need for
including higher twist effects in addition to the color octet mechanism.

two-body problem: (1) the Breit equation, and (2) the two-body Dirac equations

pathological when singularities appear at finite separations $r$ in the reduced
set of coupled equations for attractive potentials even when the potentials
themselves are not singular there. They then give rise to unphysical bound
states and resonances. In contrast, the two-body Dirac equations of constraint
dynamics do not have these pathologies in many nonperturbative treatments. To
understand these marked differences, we first express these contraint equations
in a hyperbolic form. These coupled equations are then re-cast into two
equivalent equations: (1) a covariant Breit-like equation with potentials that
are exponential functions of certain ``generator'' functions, and (2) a
covariant orthogonality constraint on the relative momentum. This reduction
enables us to show in a transparent way that finite-$r$ singularities do not
appear as long as the the exponential structure is not tampered with and the
exponential generators of the interaction are themselves nonsingular for finite
$r$. These Dirac or Breit equations, free of the structural singularities which
plague the usual Breit equation, can then be used safely under all
circumstances, encompassing numerous applications in the fields of particle,
nuclear, and atomic physics which involve highly relativistic and strong
binding configurations.

connect these to the complicated phase transitions of QCD ? For an affirmative
answer to this question, one must consider models where the coupling constants
to the scalar and vector fields must depend on density in a non-linear way,
since as such the models are not explicitly chirally invariant. Once this is
ensured, indeed one can derive a quark condensate indirectly from the energy
density of nuclear matter which goes to zero at large density and temperature.
The change to zero condensate indicates a smooth phase transition.

|q_1^2| -> 0, in which one of the photons is (almost) real. We develop a
factorization procedure for the infrared singularities ln(q_1^2),
1/q_1^2,1/q_1^4,etc., emerging in this limit. The infrared-sensitive
contributions are absorbed in this approach by bilocal correlators, which can
be also interpreted as the distribution amplitudes for (almost) real photon.
Under explicitly formulated assumptions concerning the form of these
amplitudes, we obtain a QCD sum rule for F(q_1^2=0,q_2^2=-Q^2) and study its
Q^2-dependence. In contrast to pQCD, we make no assumptions about the shape of
the pion distribution amplitude varphi_{\pi}(x). Our results agree with the
Brodsky-Lepage proposal that the Q^2-dependence of this form factor is given by
an interpolation between its Q^2=0 value fixed by the axial anomaly and 1/Q^2
pQCD value dictated by the asymptotic form of the pion distribution amplitude.
We interpret this as an evidence that the latter is rather close to the
asymptotic form.

backreaction of produced heavy particles. We claim that the stochastic nature
of effective field theories is intrinsic, in that dissipation and fluctuations
are present both above and below the threshold. Stochasticity builds up
exponentially quickly as the heavy threshold is approached from below, becoming
dominant once the threshold is crossed. But it also exists below the threshold
and is in principle detectable, albeit strongly suppressed at low energies. The
results derived here can be used to give a quantitative definition of the
`effectiveness' of a theory in terms of the relative weight of the
