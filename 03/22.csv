Green and the second author can be used to settle several questions and
conjectures concerning the geometry of irregular complex projective varieties.
First, we prove a conjecture of Arbarello and DeConcini characterizing
principally polarized abelian varieties whose theta divisors are singular in
codimension one. Secondly, we study the holomorphic Euler characteristics of
varieties of general type having maximal Albanese dimension: we verify a
conjecture of Kollar for subvarieties of abelian varieties, but show that it
fails in general. Finally, we give a surprisingly simple new proof of a
fundamental theorem of Kawamata concerning the Albanese mapping of projective
varieties of Kodaira dimension zero.

effective drift of a particle moving in a random medium. The velocity of the
particle combines a white noise diffusion process with a local drift term that
depends linearly on the gradient of a gaussian random field with homogeneous
statistics. The theoretical analysis is confirmed by numerical simulation. For
the purely isotropic case the simulation, which measures the effective drift
directly in a constant gradient background field, confirms the result
previously obtained theoretically, that the effective diffusivity and effective
drift are renormalized by the same factor from their local values. For this
isotropic case we provide an intuitive explanation, based on a {\it spatial}
average of local drift, for the renormalization of the effective drift
parameter relative to its local value. We also investigate situations in which
the isotropy is broken by the tensorial relationship of the local drift to the
gradient of the random field. We find that the numerical simulation confirms a
relatively simple renormalization group calculation for the effective
diffusivity and drift tensors.

spherically symmetric spacetimes is proposed. It is based on a unique foliation
by ingoing null hypersurfaces. The function parametrizing the hypersurfaces can
be interpreted as the phase of a light wave uniformly emitted by some far-away
static observer. The definition gives back the accepted value of surface
gravity in the static case by virtue of its nonlocal character. Although the
definition is motivated by the behavior of outgoing null rays, it turns out
that there is a simple connection between the generalized surface gravity, the
acceleration of any radially moving observer, and the observed frequency change
of the infalling light signal. In particular, this gives a practical and simple
method of how any geodesic observer can determine surface gravity by measuring
only the redshift of the infalling light wave. The surface gravity can be
expressed as an integral of matter field quantities along an ingoing null line,
which shows that it is a continuous function along the apparent horizon. A
formula for the area change of the apparent horizon is presented, and the
possibility of thermodynamical interpretation is discussed. Finally, concrete
expressions of surface gravity are given for a number of four-dimensional and
two-dimensional dynamical black hole solutions.

half-projective TQFT's, with an anomaly, $x^{\mu}$, in the composition law.
$\mu$ is a coboundary on the cobordism categories with non-negative, integer
values. The element $x$ of the ring over which the TQFT is defined does not
have to be invertible. In particular, it may be 0. This modification makes it
possible to extend quantum-invariants, which vanish on $S^1\times S^2$, to
non-trivial TQFT's. (A TQFT in the sense of Atiyah with this property has to be
trivial all together). Under a few natural assumptions the notion of a
half-projective TQFT is shown to be the only possible generalization. Based on
separate work with Lyubashenko on connected TQFT's, we construct a large class
of half-projective TQFT's with $x=0$. Their invariants vanish on $S^1\times
S^2$, and they coincide with the Hennings invariant for non-semisimple Hopf
algebras. Several toplogical tools that are relevant for vanishing properties
of such TQFT's are developed. They are concerned with connectivity properties
of cobordisms, as for example maximal non-separating surfaces. We introduce in
particular the notions of ``interior'' homotopy and homology groups, and of
coordinate graphs, which are functions on cobordisms with values in the
morphisms of a graph category. For applications we will prove that
half-projective TQFT's with $x=0$ vanish on cobordisms with infinite interior
homology, and we argue that the order of divergence of the TQFT on a cobordism
in the ``classical limit'' can be estimated by the rank of its maximal free
interior group.
