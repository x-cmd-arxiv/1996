1s and quasars) from the Rosat International X-ray/Optical Survey (RIXOS). The
sample covers a wide range in redshift (0<z<3.3), in X-ray spectral slope (-1.5
<ax<2.6) and in optical-to-X-ray ratio (0.4$<aox<1.5). A correlation is found
between ax and aox; similar correlations have recently been reported in other
X-ray and optical samples. We also identify previously unreported relationships
between the optical slope (aopt) and ax (particularly at high redshifts) and
between aopt and aox. These trends show that the overall optical-to-X-ray conti
nuum changes from convex to concave as ax hardens, demonstrating a strong beha
vioural link between the optical/UV big blue bump (BBB) and the soft X-ray ex
cess, which is consistent with them being part of the same spectral component.
By constructing models of the optical-to-X-ray continuum, we demonstrate that
the observed correlations are consistent with an intrinsic spectrum which is ab
sorbed through different amounts of cold gas and dust. The intrinsic spectrum
is the sum of an optical-to-soft X-ray `big bump' component and an ax=1 power
law; the column density of the cold gas ranges from 0 to ~4E21 cm-2 and the
dust-to-gas ratio is assumed to be Galactic. The `big bump' may be represented
by a T~1E6 K thermal bremsstrahlung or an accretion disk with a surrounding hot
corona. The scatter in the data can accommodate a wide range in big bump tempe
rature (or black hole mass) and strength. A source for the absorbing gas may be
the dusty, molecular torus which lies beyond the broad line-emitting regions,
although with a much lower column density than observed in Seyfert 2 galaxies.
Alternatively, it may be the bulge of a spiral host galaxy or an elliptical
host galaxy.

ApJ submitted",,"10.1086/177808",,"astro-ph",,"  A model of Lyman limit QSO absorption systems is investigated where they are
produced in gaseous galactic halos with a two-phase structure: a hot phase at
the halo virial temperature in approximate pressure equilibrium, and a cold,
photoionized phase in the form of clouds confined by the pressure of the hot
medium, and falling through it to the halo center. We show that the masses of
these clouds must be over a relatively narrow range so that they are stable
against gravitational collapse and evaporation. These masses, near $10^6
\msun$, also lead to a covering factor near unity. The hot phase is required to
have a core radius such that its cooling time in the core is equal to the age
of the halo, and the mass in the cold phase is determined by the rate at which
the hot gas cools. We calculate the number of Lyman limit systems arising in
halos of different masses in a CDM model and their impact parameters implied by
these assumptions, and find them to be in reasonable agreement with
observations. The observed low ionization systems such as MgII are well
reproduced as arising from the photoionized phase, and are mostly in halos
around massive galaxies, while CIV selected systems are predicted to be more
commonly associated with lower mass galaxies and larger impact parameters. The
hot phase may give rise to detectable absorption lines in OVI, while the column
densities predicted for other highly ionized species are low and difficult to

galaxies with very similar dynamical properties existed at a z=0.4.

form factor, which is calculated in terms of a constituent quark model wave
function for the B-meson. Different approximations for the latter, either based
on a phenomenological ansatz or derived from analyses of the meson spectra, are
adopted. In particular, two wave functions, constructed via the Hamiltonian
light-front formalism using a relativized and a non-relativistic constituent
quark model, are considered, obtaining a link between standard spectroscopic
quark models and the B-meson decay physics. The inclusive semileptonic and
non-leptonic branching ratios are calculated within a convolution approach,
inspired by the partonic model and involving the same B-meson wave function
used for the evaluation of the exclusive semileptonic modes. Our results for
the major branching ratios are consistent with available experimental data and
the sum of all the calculated branching ratios turns out to be close to unity.
In particular, we found that: i) a remarkable fraction (~ 35%) of semileptonic
decay modes occur in non-D, non-D* final states; ii) non-perturbative effects
enhance the inclusive b -> c \bar{u} d decay channels, with a sizable
contribution provided by internal decays into heavy mesons and
baryon-antibaryon pairs; the resulting reduction of the semileptonic branching
ratio brings the theoretical prediction in agreement with the experimental
value without increasing at the same time the charm counting.

the one of the six-dimensional gauge field kinetic energies changes sign. An
exception is the $E_8 \times E_8$ string with equal instanton numbers in the
two $E_8$'s, which admits a heterotic/heterotic self-duality. In this paper, we
generalize the dyonic string solution of the six-dimensional heterotic string
to include non-trivial gauge field configurations corresponding to self-dual
Yang-Mills instantons in the four transverse dimensions. We find that vacua
which undergo a phase transition always admit a string solution exhibiting a
naked singularity, whereas for vacua admitting a self-duality the solution is
always regular. When there is a phase transition, there exists a choice of
instanton numbers for which the dyonic string is tensionless and
quasi-anti-self-dual at that critical value of the coupling. For an infinite
subset of the other choices of instanton number, the string will also be
tensionless, but all at larger values of the coupling.

make the universe appear extremely complex to any self-aware subsets that

the big bang. For instance, gravitational instability would amplify the
microscopic primordial density fluctuations that are required by the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle into quite macroscopic inhomogeneities, forcing the
current wavefunction of the universe to contain such Byzantine superpositions
as our planet being in many macroscopically different places at once. Since
decoherence bars us from experiencing more than one macroscopic reality, we
would see seemingly complex constellations of stars etc, even if the initial
wavefunction of the universe was perfectly homogeneous and isotropic.
