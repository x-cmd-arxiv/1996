linear slopes to this magnitude-decline rate relation in BV(I)kc colors, using
a sample with Bmax-Vmax < 0.2 mag. The scatter around this linear relation (and
thus the ability to measure SNe Ia distances) ranges from 0.13 mag (in the I
band) to 0.17 mag (in the B band). We also find evidence for significant
correlations between the absolute magnitudes or the decline rate of the light
curve, and the morphological type of the host galaxy.

to z~0.1. Using BVI data for these objects and nearby SNe Ia, we have shown
that there exists a significant dispersion in the intrinsic luminosities of
these objects. We have devised a robust chisquare minimization technique
simultaneously fitting the BVI light curves to parametrize the SN event as a
function of (tb,m, m15(B)) where tb is the time of B maximum, m is the peak BVI
magnitude corrected for luminosity variations, and m15(B) is a single parameter
describing the whole light curve morphology. When properly corrected for
m15(B), SNe Ia prove to be high precision distance indicators,yielding relative
distances with errors 7-10%. The corrected peak magnitudes are used to
construct BVI Hubble diagrams (HD), and with Cepheid distances recently
measured with the HST to four nearby SNe Ia (37C, 72E, 81B, 90N) we derive a
value of the Hubble constant of 63.1+/-3.4 (internal) km/s/Mpc. This value is
~10-15% larger than the value obtained by assuming that SNe Ia are perfect
standard candles. As we have shown in Paper V, there is now strong evidence
that galaxies with younger stellar population appear to host the
slowest-declining, and therefore most luminous SNe Ia. Hence, the use of Pop I
objects such as Cepheids to calibrate the zero point of the SNe Ia HD can
easily bias the results toward luminous SNe Ia, unless the absolute
magnitude-decline relation is taken into account.

study the general morphology of SNe Ia light curves. We find that several of
the main features of the BVI templates correlate tightly with m15(B). In
particular, the V light curves, which are probably a reasonably good
approximation of the bolometric light curves, display an orderly progression in
shapes between the most-luminous, slowest-declining events and the
least-luminous, fastest-declining SNe. This supports the idea that the observed
spectroscopic and photometric sequences of SNe Ia are due primarily to one
parameter. Nevertheless, SNe with very similar initial decline rates do show
significant differences in their light curve properties when examined in
detail, suggesting the influence of one or more secondary parameters.

infer whether their assertions and proposals have been accepted or rejected by

logical consistency is a necessary indicator of acceptance, but that it is not
sufficient, and that logical inconsistency is sufficient as an indicator of
rejection, but it is not necessary. I show how conversants can use information
structure and prosody as well as logical reasoning in distinguishing between
acceptances and logically consistent rejections, and relate this work to
previous work on implicature and default reasoning by introducing three new
classes of rejection: {\sc implicature rejections}, {\sc epistemic rejections}
and {\sc deliberation rejections}. I show how these rejections are inferred as
a result of default inferences, which, by other analyses, would have been
blocked by the context. In order to account for these facts, I propose a model
of the common ground that allows these default inferences to go through, and
show how the model, originally proposed to account for the various forms of
acceptance, can also model all types of rejection.

plasma created from Au+Au collision at LHC and RHIC energies starting from the
early moment when the particle momentum distributions in the central region
become for the first time isotropic due to longitudinal cooling. Using the
relaxation time approximation for the collision terms in the Boltzmann
equations for gluons and for quarks and the real collision terms constructed
from the simplest QCD interactions, we show that the collision times have the
right behaviour for equilibration. The magnitude of the quark (antiquark)
collision time remains bigger than the gluon collision time throughout the
lifetime of the plasma so that gluons are equilibrating faster than quarks both
chemically and kinetically. That is we have a two-stage equilibration scenario
as has been pointed out already by Shuryak sometimes ago. Full kinetic
equilibration is however slow and chemical equilibration cannot be completed
before the onset of the deconfinement phase transition assumed to be at
$T_c=200$ MeV. By comparing the collision entropy density rates of the
different processes, we show explicitly that inelastic processes, and
\emph{not} elastic processes as is commonly assumed, are dominant in the
equilibration of the plasma and that gluon branching leads the other processes
in entropy generation. We also show that, within perturbative QCD, processes
with higher power in \alpha_s need not be less important for the purpose of
equilibration than those with lower power. The state of equilibration of the
system has also a role to play. We compare our results with those of the parton
cascade model.
