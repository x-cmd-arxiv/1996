is a neutron star with a surface magnetic field of 10^7 to 10^10 G and a spin
frequency of a few hundred Hertz, accreting gas via a Keplerian disk. The
frequency of the higher-frequency QPO in a kilohertz QPO pair is the Keplerian
frequency at a radius near the sonic point at the inner edge of the Keplerian
flow whereas the frequency of the lower-frequency QPO is approximately the
difference between the Keplerian frequency at a radius near the sonic point and
the stellar spin frequency. This model explains naturally many properties of
the kilohertz QPOs, including their frequencies, amplitudes, and coherence. We
show that if the frequency of the higher-frequency QPO in a pair is an orbital
frequency, as in the sonic-point model, the frequencies of these QPOs place
interesting upper bounds on the masses and radii of the neutron stars in the
kilohertz QPO sources and provide new constraints on the equation of state of
matter at high densities. Further observations of these QPOs may provide
compelling evidence for the existence of a marginally stable orbit, confirming
a key prediction of general relativity in the strong-field regime.

modify Wegner's scaling law relating the conductivity exponent to the

properties of the disordered phase. The existence of random potentials
(diagonal or ``site'' disorder) leads to a suppression of local magnetic
moments which eventually destroys AFLRO. Randomness in the hopping elements
(off-diagonal disorder), on the other hand, does not significantly reduce the
density of local magnetic moments. For this type of disorder, at half-filling,
there is no ``sign-problem'' in the simulations as long as the hopping is
restricted between neighbor sites on a bipartite lattice. This allows the study
of sufficiently large lattices and low temperatures to perform a finite-size
scaling analysis. For off-diagonal disorder AFLRO is eventually destroyed when
the fluctuations of antiferromagnetic exchange couplings exceed a critical
value. The disordered phase close to the transition appears to be
incompressible and shows an increase of the uniform susceptibility at low
temperatures.

model, we investigate the relation between the partition function formally
defined on the entire phase space and the one written in terms of the reduced
phase space. In particular the case of $g=1$ is analyzed in detail.
  By a suitable gauge-fixing, the partition function $Z$ basically reduces to
the partition function defined for the reduced system, whose dynamical
variables are $(\tau^A, p_A)$. [The $\tau^A$'s are the Teichm\""uller
parameters, and the $p_A$'s are their conjugate momenta.]
  As for the case of $g=1$, we find out that $Z$ is also related with another
reduced form, whose dynamical variables are $(\tau^A, p_A)$ and $(V, \sigma)$.
[Here $\sigma$ is a conjugate momentum to 2-volume $V$.] A nontrivial factor
appears in the measure in terms of this type of reduced form. The factor turns
out to be a Faddeev-Popov determinant coming from the time-reparameterization
invariance inherent in this type of formulation. Thus the relation between two
reduced forms becomes transparent even in the context of quantum theory.
  Furthermore for $g=1$, a factor coming from the zero-modes of a differential
operator $P_1$ can appear in the path-integral measure in the reduced
representation of $Z$. It depends on the path-integral domain for the shift
vector in $Z$: If it is defined to include $\ker P_1$, the nontrivial factor
does not appear. On the other hand, if the integral domain is defined to
exclude $\ker P_1$, the factor appears in the measure. This factor can depend
on the dynamical variables, typically as a function of $V$, and can influence
the semiclassical dynamics of the (2+1)-dimensional spacetime.
  These results shall be significant from the viewpoint of quantum gravity.

good part of this spectrum. However, near the high-mass end-point this
distribution becomes negative with the current value of the non-perturbative

nuclear physics is associated with definitions of potential operators. In
principle, this potential carries the rich substructure consisting of quarks
and gluons and thus may be deduced from some microscopic model. In this spirit
we propose a boson exchange potential from a nonlinear quantum field theory.
Essentially, the meson propagators and form factors of conventional models are
replaced by amplitudes derived from the dynamics of self-interacting mesons in
terms of solitary fields. Contrary to deduction, we position the inversion
approach. Using Gel'fand-Levitan and Marchenko inversion we compute local,
energy-independent potentials from experimental phase shifts for various
partial waves. Both potential models give excellent results for on-shell NN
scattering data. In the off-shell domain we study both potential models in PP
Bremsstrahlung, elastic nucleon-nucleus scattering and triton binding energy
calculations. It remains surprising that for all observables the inversion and
microscopic meson exchange potentials are equivalent in their reproduction of
data. Finally, we look for another realm of elementary interactions where
inversion and meson exchange models can be applied with the hope to find more
sensitivity to discern substructure dynamics.
