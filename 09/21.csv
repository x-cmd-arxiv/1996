  accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal 10/16/96",,"10.1086/303717",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a statistical analysis of the ultraviolet emission lines of
cataclysmic variables (CVs) based on $\approx 430$ ultraviolet spectra of 20
sources extracted from the International Ultraviolet Explorer Uniform Low
Dispersion Archive. These spectra are used to measure the emission line fluxes
of N V, Si IV, C IV, and He II and to construct diagnostic flux ratio diagrams.
We investigate the flux ratio parameter space populated by individual CVs and
by various CV subclasses (e.g., AM Her stars, DQ Her stars, dwarf novae,
nova-like variables). For most systems, these ratios are clustered within a
range of $\sim 1$ decade for log Si IV/C IV $\approx -0.5$ and log He II/C IV
$\approx -1.0$ and $\sim 1.5$ decades for log N V/C IV $\approx -0.25$. These
ratios are compared to photoionization and collisional ionization models to
constrain the excitation mechanism and the physical conditions of the
line-emitting gas. We find that the collisional models do the poorest job of
reproducing the data. The photoionization models reproduce the Si IV/C IV line
ratios for some shapes of the ionizing spectrum, but the predicted N V/C IV
line ratios are simultaneously too low by typically $\sim 0.5$ decades. Worse,
for no parameters are any of the models able to reproduce the observed He II/C
IV line ratios; this ratio is far too small in the collisional and scattering
models and too large by typically $\sim 0.5$ decades in the photoionization
models.

that 55 Cnc and 51 Peg are super metal- rich, 47 UMa and 70 Vir have roughly
solar metallicities, and HD 114762 is metal-poor. Otherwise, the abundance
patterns, expressed as [X/Fe], are approximately solar. The ages of 47 UMa and
51 Peg are similar to that of the Sun; 70 Vir is slightly older, and 55 Cnc and
HD 114762 are at least 10 Gyr old. Our estimates of vsini for the parent stars
are 1.4, 1.8, 2.0, < 1, and < 1.5 km/s for 55 Cnc, 51 Peg, 47 UMa, 70 Vir, and
HD 114762, respectively. Using these data and estimates for the rotation
periods and radii, the corresponding masses of the companions are: > 0.6, 0.51,
4.6, > 20, and > 8.5 MJ. The systems appear to fall into three groups: roughly
Jupiter mass companions with small circular orbits with metal-rich parent stars
(55 Cnc and 51 Peg), larger companions with larger circular orbits (47 UMa),
and much more massive companions with large eccentric orbits around moderately
metal- poor parent stars (70 Vir and HD 114762). Our findings are consistent
with the recently proposed mechanism whereby a gas giant migrates to within a
few hundredths of an AU of its parent star during the formative epoch of the
planetary system. During this process the material between the giant planet and
the star is accreted onto the latter. If the accreted material is depleted in H
and He, then the photospheric composition of the parent star might be altered
significantly.

analyses concerning the pulsational properties of these evolving structures. In
this connection a suitable set of stellar models characterized by two different
metal contents, namely Z=0.01 and Z=0.02 were followed through both H and He
burning phases. This evolutionary scenario covers the theoretical expectations
for pulsating He burning structures with ages ranging from 20 to less than 1
Gyr. For each given assumption about the star metallicity we find that ""old"" He
burning pulsators with ages larger than 2 Gyr have a common behavior, with
Z=0.01 pulsators slightly more luminous and more massive than Z=0.02 pulsators.
However, as soon as the metallicity increases above the solar value, the
luminosity of Horizontal Branch (HB) stars increases again. This effect is a
direct consequence of the expected simultaneous increase of both original He
and metals. The occurrence of ""young"" RR Lyrae pulsators is discussed. Hydrogen
burning isochrones for the quoted metallicity values are also presented and
discussed. Finally, the occurrence of a new ""gravonuclear instability"" in some

strongly coupled Symmetry Breaking Sector in terms of a few parameters. Based
on a dispersive approach we have studied the resonance spectrum up to 3 TeV in
the chiral parameter space. This procedure could also be useful to extract the
higher energy resonant behavior from low-energy collider data. It is also shown
how the method reproduces the correct pole structure of resonances as well as
other analytic features. The results also hint at a possible excluded region of
parameter space.

formulated in terms of geometrical invariants of world trajectories of masses
at the string ends. In the three--dimensional Minkowski space $E^1_2$, there
are two invariants of that sort, the curvature $K$ and torsion $\kappa$.
Curvatures of trajectories of the string ends with masses are always constant,
$K_i = \gamma/m_i (i =1,2,)$, whereas torsions $\kappa_i(\tau)$ obey a system
of differential equations with deviating arguments. For these equations with
periodic $\kappa_i(\tau+n l)=\kappa(\tau)$, constants of motion are obtained
(part I) and exact solutions are presented (part II) for periods $l$ and $2l$
where $l$ is the string length in the plane of parameters $\tau$ and $\sigma \
(\sigma_1 = 0, \sigma_2 =l)$.

potential influence on the two-body effective interaction has also been
introduced. The many-body effects have been partially taken into account by
employing the recently introduced multi-valued effective interaction approach.
Dependence of the He5 energy levels on the harmonic-oscillator frequency as
well as on the size of the model space has been studied. The Reid 93
nucleon-nucleon potential has been used in the study, but results have also
been obtained using the Nijmegen II potential for comparison.

one-body electromagnetic current, which includes the phenomenological
constituent quark form factors already determined from an analysis of pion and
nucleon experimental data, is adopted. For $Q^2$ up to few $(GeV/c)^2$, at
variance with the enhancement found in the elastic channel, the effect of
configuration mixing results in a significant suppression of the calculated
helicity amplitudes with respect to both relativistic and non-relativistic
calculations, based on a simple gaussian-like ansatz for the baryon wave
functions.

backward kinematics for the spectator nucleon to minimize effects from the
deuteron wave function and final state interactions, one can isolate the
modifications in the structure of the bound nucleon within the impulse
approximation. The same reaction can be used to extract the large-x neutron to
proton structure function ratio.
