reviewed. We first discuss estimates of the preheating time scale and particle
production at the early stages of parametric amplification within the Mathieu
and Lam'e approximations and we analyze their precision and limitations. The
necessity of self-consistent calculations including the non-linearity of the
field theory equations in an energy conserving scheme is stressed. The large N
calculations including the field back-reaction are reviewed. For spontaneously
broken theories the issue of symmetry restoration is analyzed. A discussion of
the possibility and criterion for symmetry restoration is presented.

to calculate the critical exponents of various operators in terms of the
stiffness constant of the interface. Monte Carlo simulations for the
ground-state ensemble utilizing this interfacial representation are performed
to study both the dynamical and the static properties of the model. This method
yields more accurate numerical results for the critical exponents. By varying
the spin magnitude in the model, we find that the model exhibits three phases
with a Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition at 3/2<S_{KT}<2 and a locking phase
transition at 5/2 < S_L \leq 3. The phase diagram at finite temperatures is

first order term in an expansion of the Helmholtz free energy functional
instead of an additive {\it ad hoc} term and the proper solid reference
structure is used instead of some kind of mapping into the fluid structure at
some effective density. As the theory reduces to the usual liquid perturbation
theory in the uniform limit, it can describe consistently the complete phase

  Search Control and Pruning","See http://www.jair.org/ for an online appendix and other files
  accompanying this article","Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 5, (1996), 95-137",,,"cs.AI",,"  We propose some domain-independent techniques for bringing well-founded
partial-order planners closer to practicality. The first two techniques are
aimed at improving search control while keeping overhead costs low. One is
based on a simple adjustment to the default A* heuristic used by UCPOP to
select plans for refinement. The other is based on preferring ``zero
commitment'' (forced) plan refinements whenever possible, and using LIFO
prioritization otherwise. A more radical technique is the use of operator
parameter domains to prune search. These domains are initially computed from
the definitions of the operators and the initial and goal conditions, using a
polynomial-time algorithm that propagates sets of constants through the
operator graph, starting in the initial conditions. During planning, parameter
domains can be used to prune nonviable operator instances and to remove
spurious clobbering threats. In experiments based on modifications of UCPOP,
our improved plan and goal selection strategies gave speedups by factors
ranging from 5 to more than 1000 for a variety of problems that are nontrivial
for the unmodified version. Crucially, the hardest problems gave the greatest
improvements. The pruning technique based on parameter domains often gave
speedups by an order of magnitude or more for difficult problems, both with the
default UCPOP search strategy and with our improved strategy. The Lisp code for
our techniques and for the test problems is provided in on-line appendices.

structure, but also in a sentential sense to convey semantic rather than
structural information. Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or
sentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit
discourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and
plan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for
classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning
programs (Cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets
of pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine
learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the
generation of classification models, but also for improving upon previous
results. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the
literature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain
new linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to
automatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively
analyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data.
Finally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and
flexible than manual methods.
