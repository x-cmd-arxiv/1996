recovered non-parametrically from a dust-corrected near-infrared COBE/DIRBE
surface brightness map of the inner Galaxy. The best fits to the photometry are
obtained when the Sun is assumed to lie $\sim14\pm4\pc$ below the plane. The
recovered density distributions clearly show an elongated three-dimensional
bulge set in a highly non-axisymmetric disk. In the favoured models, the bulge
has axis ratios $1{:}0.6{:}0.4$ and semi-major axis length $\sim2\kpc$. Its
nearer long axis lies in the first quadrant. The bulge is surrounded by an
elliptical disk that extends to $\sim2\kpc$ on the minor axis and $\sim3.5\kpc$
on the major axis. In all models there is a local density minimum $\sim2.2\kpc$
down the minor axis. The subsequent maximum $\sim3\kpc$ down the minor axis
(corresponding to $l\simeq-22\deg$ and $l\simeq 17\deg$) may be associated with
the Lagrange point L$_4$. From this identification and the length of the
bulge-bar, we infer a pattern speed $\Omega_b\simeq 60-70\kms\kpc^{-1}$ for the
bar. Experiments in which pseudo-data derived from models with spiral structure
were deprojected under the assumption that the Galaxy is either eight-fold or
four-fold symmetric, indicate that the highly non-axisymmetric disks recovered
from the COBE data could reflect spiral structure within the Milky Way if that
structure involves density contrasts greater than $\gta 3$ at NIR wavelengths.
These experiments indicate that the angle $\phi_0$ between the Sun--centre line
and a major axis of the bulge lies near $20\deg$.

--neutron stars and white dwarfs--, their properties are determined by two
(rather than one) parameters, the central star density and the density at the
base of the nuclear crust. This leads to stellar strange-matter configurations
whose properties are much more complex than those of the conventional sequence.
As an example, two generically different categories of stable strange dwarfs
are found, which could be the observed white dwarfs. Furthermore we find
very-low-mass strange stellar objects, with masses as small as those of Jupiter
or even lighter planets. Such objects, if abundant enough in our Galaxy, should
be seen by the presently performed gravitational microlensing searches.

"astro-ph/9609068","Philippe Jetzer","Philippe Jetzer","Neutrinos and dark matter in galactic halos","Latex",,,"ZU-TH 21/1996","astro-ph",,"  One of the most important problems in astrophysics concerns the nature of the
dark matter in galactic halos, whose presence is implied mainly by the observed
flat rotation curves in spiral galaxies. Due to the Pauli exclusion principle
it can be shown that neutrinos cannot be a major constituent of the halo dark
matter. As far as cold dark matter is concerned there might be a discrepancy
between the results of the N-body simulations and the measured rotation curves
for dwarf galaxies. A fact this, if confirmed, which would exclude cold dark
matter as a viable candidate for the halo dark matter.
  In the framework of a baryonic scenario the most plausible candidates are
brown or white dwarfs and cold molecular clouds (mainly of $H_2$). The former
can be detected with the ongoing microlensing experiments. In fact, the French
collaboration EROS and the American-Australian collaboration MACHO have
reported the observation of altogether $\sim$ 10 microlensing events by
monitoring during several years the brightness of millions of stars in the
Large Magellanic Cloud. In particular, the MACHO team announced the discovery
of 8 microlensing candidates by analysing their first 2 years of observations.
This would imply that the halo dark matter fraction in form of MACHOs (Massive
Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects) is of the order of 45-50% assuming a
standard spherical halo model. The most accurate way to get information on the
mass of the MACHOs is to use the method of mass moments, which leads to an
average mass of 0.27$M_{\odot}$.

(with full widths at half maximum of ~10000 km s-1) and have double-peaked
profiles. Such features are rarely observed in AGN in general but are even more
unusual in radio-quiet objects. The analysis of the ROSAT PSPC data reveals a
non-varying, unabsorbed spectrum with an energy spectral index, alphax=1.2 and
little or no emission from a soft X-ray excess. The slope of the optical
spectrum is similar, alphaopt=1.0, and is consistent with an extrapolation of
the X-ray spectrum, suggesting that the same power-law continuum may dominate
throughout and that the big blue bump component is relatively weak. We look for
a link between these various properties and investigate models of double-peaked
Balmer line emission in AGN. An accretion disc origin is unlikely in RX
J1042+1212 as this model predicts that lines emitted by a disc should have a
net gravitational redshift (both Halpha and Hbeta have a net blueshift).
Emission from two broad line regions, each gravitationally bound to one
component of a supermassive black hole binary, is a possibility if the two
components are similar in size and nature. Alternatively, the lines (or at
least the narrow peaks of the lines) may be produced by a double-sided jet or
bipolar flow.

trial isotropic harmonic energy containing force constants between {\em

representation and the use of incremental matrix inversion, an efficient and
fast-convergent iterative algorithm is constructed, that optimizes the free
energy. The computational demand scales as $N^3$ rather than $N^4$ as expected
in a more naive approach. The method has the additional advantage that in
contrast to Monte Carlo calculations the entropy is easily computed. An
analysis of the high and low temperature limits is given. Also, the variational
formulation is shown to respect the appropriate virial identities.The accuracy
of the approximations introduced are tested against Monte Carlo simulations for
problem sizes ranging from $N=20$ to 1024. Very good accuracy is obtained for
chains with unscreened Coulomb interactions. The addition of salt is described
through a screened Coulomb interaction, for which the accuracy in a certain
parameter range turns out to be inferior to the unscreened case. The reason is
that the harmonic variational Ansatz becomes less efficient with shorter range
interactions.
  As a by-product a very efficient Monte Carlo algorithm was developed for
comparisons, providing high statistics data for very large sizes -- 2048
monomers. The Monte Carlo results are also used to examine scaling properties,
based on low-$T$ approximations to end-end and monomer-monomer separations. It

degenerate than either the 331 or the Pfaffian. We introduce a modification of
the model which has the degeneracies of the 331 state everywhere including the
Pfaffian point; at the latter point, tunneling reduces the degeneracies to
those of the Pfaffian state. An experimental difference is pointed out between
the Laughlin states of electron pairs and the other paired states, in the
current-voltage response when electrons tunnel into the edge. And there's more.

by perturbation (PT) theory is not correctly describing the accelerator
experiments at the highest energies. A natural explanation is provided by the
authors' 1992 proposal that in fact the true running predicted by the
nonperturbatively defined lattice QCD is different, leading to an ultraviolet
fixed point near $\alpha_s=.1$. It is explained how this can be understood from
the fact that the conventional perturbative method is ambiguous and does not
provide the correct asymptotic expansion. It is pointed out that there is a
large amount of lattice data that are supporting this scenario rather than the
conventional one.
