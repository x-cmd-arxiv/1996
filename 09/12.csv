extends about +/-300 km/s from the systemic velocity. Images with

the relative orientation of the known radio jet, we propose that the maser
emission arises on the surface of a nearly edge-on torus, where physical
conditions are conducive to maser action. The visible part of the torus is
axially thick, with comparable height and radius. The velocity field indicates
sub-Keplerian differential rotation around a central mass of about 1e7 Msun
that lies within a cylindrical radius of about 0.65 pc. The estimated
luminosity of the central engine is about 0.5 of the Eddington limit. There is
no detectable compact radio continuum emission near the proposed center of the

flat-spectrum core cannot be direct self-absorbed synchrotron radiation.

results of a multiwavelength campaign during the January 1994 periastron
passage of PSR B1259-63, we discuss several issues regarding the mechanism of
high-energy emission. Unpulsed power law emission from the this system was
detected near periastron in the energy range 1-200 keV. We find that the
observed high energy emission from the PSR B1259-63 system is not compatible
with accretion or propeller-powered emission. Shock-powered high-energy
emission produced by the pulsar/outflow interaction is consistent with all high
energy observations. By studying the evolution of the pulsar cavity we
constrain the magnitude and geometry of the mass outflow outflow of the Be
star. The pulsar/outflow interaction is most likely mediated by a collisionless
shock at the internal boundary of the pulsar cavity. The system shows all the
characteristics of a {\it binary plerion} being {\it diffuse} and {\it compact}
near apastron and periastron, respectively. The PSR B1259-63 cavity is subject
to different radiative regimes depending on whether synchrotron or inverse
Compton (IC) cooling dominates the radiation of electron/positron pairs
advected away from the inner boundary of the pulsar cavity. The highly
non-thermal nature of the observed X-ray/gamma-ray emission near periastron
establishes the existence of an efficient particle acceleration mechanism
within a timescale shown to be less than $\sim 10^2-10^3$ s. A synchrotron/IC

arcminute field are detected. We exploit high resolution WFPC2 images to
systematically determine morphological classifications of galaxies as disk- or
bulge-dominated down to I<=23 mag (V<=24 mag), and to differentiate galaxies
from stars one magnitude fainter. Down to I<=25 mag the number of galaxy pairs
with separations less than 3 arcsec is consistent with a shortward
extrapolation of the angular two-point correlation function w(theta)
proportional to theta^-0.8 observed from the same data; the fraction of such
pairs showing morphological evidence for physical association accounts for a
third of the total numbers suggested by a shortward extrapolation of w(theta).
The latter result may not be too surprising given the low surface brightness of
the tidal tails resulting from galaxy interactions, i.e. much of the evidence
for interactions may fall below our detection limit. Moreover, we find no trend
between apparent physical association (on the basis of morphology) and (V--I)

to agree closely to simulations of a real GA averaged over many runs,

computationally efficient size of training batch each generation. For

Tetrahedra can be joined together to make a three-dimensional piecewise linear

the interior of the tetrahedra and values to their squared edge-lengths. The
subset of the space of squared edge-lengths obeying triangle and analogous
inequalities is simplicial configuration space. We derive the Lund-Regge metric
on simplicial configuration space and show how it provides the shortest
distance between simplicial three-geometries among all choices of gauge inside
the simplices for defining this metric (Regge gauge freedom). We show
analytically that there is always at least one physical timelike direction in
simplicial configuration space and provide a lower bound on the number of
spacelike directions. We show that in the neighborhood of points in this space
corresponding to flat metrics there are spacelike directions corresponding to
gauge freedom in assigning the edge-lengths. We evaluate the signature
numerically for the simplicial configuration spaces based on some simple

measured 1- and 2-particle momentum spectra information on the space-time
geometry and dynamics of the particle emitting source. Particular attention is
given to the rapid expansion and short lifetime of the sources created in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Model-independent expressions for the HBT
size parameters in terms of the space-time variances of the source are derived,
and a new parametrization of the correlation function is suggested which allows
to separate the transverse, longitudinal and temporal extension of the source
and to measure its transverse and longitudinal expansion velocity. The effects
of resonance decays are also discussed.

plasma formed in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions may be inhomogeneous,
with large fluctuations of the local energy density (hot spots), and turbulent,
with a chaotic initial transverse velocity field. Assuming rapid local
thermalization, the evolution of such plasmas is computed using longitudinal
boost-invariant 3+1-dimensional hydrodynamics. We compare the evolution in case
that the speed of sound in the plasma is constant to one resulting from an
equation of state involving a strong first order transition, with a minimum of
the velocity of sound as a function of energy density. We find that azimuthally
asymmetric fluctuations and correlations of the transverse energy flow can
develop in both cases due to the initial inhomogeneities. Hot spots also
enhance significantly high-transverse momenta direct photon yields. In the case
with a phase transition, the hadronization surface evolves into an unusual
foam-like structure. Also in that case, we find that hadronization is
considerably delayed relative to the ideal gas case, just as previous studies
have found for homogeneous initial conditions. The time-delay signature of a
rapid cross-over transition region in the QCD equation of state (as observable
via meson interferometry) is thus found to be remarkably robust to
uncertainties in the initial conditions in heavy-ion reactions.

$1/N$ expansion thereby introducing the self consistent Hartree approximation,
the Dirac sea corrections and the one fermion loop meson self energies in a
unified way. For simplicity, the Dirac sea is further treated within a
semiclassical expansion to all orders. The well-known Landau pole vacuum
instability appearing in this kind of theories is removed by means of a scheme
recently proposed in this context. The effect of such removal on the low
momentum effective parameters of the model, relevant to describe nuclear matter
and finite nuclei, is analyzed. The one fermion loop meson self energies are
found to have a sizeable contribution to these parameters. However, such
contribution turns out to come mostly from the Landau poles and is thus
spurious. We conclude that the fermionic loop can only be introduced
consistently in the $\sigma$-$\omega$ nuclear model if the Landau pole problem
is dealt with properly.

agreement with the pion production data at 400 and 450 MeV over a range of
angles shows that spin-singlet final states cannot be more than of the order of
10%. On the other hand it is seen that the spin-singlet states must provide
about 30% of the strength in pion production at 1 GeV as well as
deuteron-proton backward scattering at 1.6 GeV.
