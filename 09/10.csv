postmaximum decline rate and color at maximum light of Type Ia supernovae (SN
Ia) with model predictions.
  The observations are based on a total of 40 SN Ia with 29 SN of the Calan
Tololo Supernova Search and 11 local SN which cover a range of 2 mag in the
absolute visual brightness.
  The observed correlations are not tight, one dimensional relations.
Supernovae with the same postmaximum decline or the same color have a spread in
visual magnitude of about 0.7 mag. The dispersion in the color-magnitude
relation may result from uncertainties in the distance determinations or the
interstellar reddening within the host galaxy. The dispersion in the decline
rate-magnitude relation suggests that an intrinsic spread in the supernova
properties exists that cannot be accounted for by any single relation between
visual brightness and postmaximum decline.
  Theoretical correlations are derived from a grid of models which encompasses
delayed detonations, pulsating delayed detonations, the merging scenario and
helium detonations.
  We find that the observed correlations can be understood in terms of
explosions of Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs.
  Our models show an intrinsic spread in the relations of about 0.5 mag in the
maximum brightness and about 0.1 mag in the B-V color.
  Our study provides strong evidence against the mechanism of helium detonation
for subluminous, red SN Ia.

gravity and gas dynamics can predict the abundance of such absorbers in
cosmological models. We develop a semi-analytical method to correct the
numerical predictions for the contribution of unresolved low mass halos, and we
apply this method to the Katz et al. (1996) simulation of the standard cold
dark matter model ($\Omega=1$, $h=0.5$, $\Omega_b=0.05$, $\sigma_8=0.7$). Using
this simulation and higher resolution simulations of individual low mass
systems, we determine the relation between a halo's circular velocity $v_c$ and
its cross section for producing Lyman limit or damped absorption. We combine
this relation with the Press-Schechter formula for the abundance of halos to
compute the number of absorbers per unit redshift. The resolution correction
increases the predicted abundances by about a factor of two at z=2, 3, and 4,
bringing the predicted number of damped absorbers into quite good agreement
with observations. Roughly half of the systems reside in halos with circular
velocities $v_c>100\kms$ and half in halos with $35\kms<v_c<100\kms$. Halos
with $v_c>150\kms$ typically harbor two or more systems capable of producing
damped absorption. Even with the resolution correction, the predicted abundance
of Lyman limit systems is a factor of three below observational estimates,
signifying either a failure of standard CDM or a failure of these simulations
to resolve the systems responsible for most Lyman limit absorption. By
comparing simulations with and without star formation, we find that depletion
of the gas supply by star formation affects absorption line statistics at
$z>=2$ only for column densities exceeding $N_{HI}=10^{22} cm^{-2}$.

to quantifying peculiar galaxy morphologies on images obtained from the Medium
Deep Survey (MDS) and other surveys using the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2

peculiarity and put them to use on a sample of 978 galaxies, classifying them
by eye as either normal or peculiar. Based on our criteria and on concepts
borrowed from digital image processing we design a set of four purely
morphological parameters, which comprise the overall texture (or
``blobbiness'') of the image; the distortion of isophotes; the filling-factor
of isophotes; and the skeleta of detected structures. We also examine the
parameters suggested by Abraham et al. (1995). An artificial neural network
(ANN) is trained to distinguish between normal and peculiar galaxies. While the
majority of peculiar galaxies are disk-dominated, we also find evidence for a
significant population of bulge-dominated peculiars. Consequently, peculiar
galaxies do not all form a ``natural'' continuation of the Hubble sequence
beyond the late spirals and the irregulars. The trained neural network is
applied to a second, larger sample of 1999 WFPC2 images and its probabilistic
capabilities are used to estimate the frequency of peculiar galaxies at

structure, but also in a sentential sense to convey semantic rather than

sentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit
discourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and
plan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for
classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning
programs (Cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets
of pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine
learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the
generation of classification models, but also for improving upon previous
results. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the
literature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain
new linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to
automatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively
analyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data.
Finally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and
flexible than manual methods.

studied. This class admits a geodesic, shear-free null congruence which is
non-twisting but in general diverging and the corresponding solutions in
Einstein's theory form the Robinson-Trautman family together with a subset of
the Kundt's class. The Robinson-Trautman conditions are found to be frame
invariant in string theory. The Lorentz Chern-Simons three form of the stringy
Robinson-Trautman solutions is shown to be always closed. The stringy
generalizations of the vacuum Robinson-Trautman equation are obtained and three
subclasses of solutions are identified. One of these subclasses exists, among
all the dilatonic theories, only in Einstein's theory and in string theory.
Several known solutions including the dilatonic black holes, the pp- waves, the
stringy C-metric and certain solutions which correspond to exact conformal
field theories are shown to be particular members of the stringy
Robinson-Trautman family. Some new solutions which are static or asymptotically
flat and radiating are also presented. The radiating solutions have a positive
Bondi mass. One of these radiating solutions has the property that it settles
down smoothly to a black hole state at late retarded times.

complex analytic in the matter central charge $c$ and we propose to define the
amplitudes for arbitrary value of $c$ by analytic continuation. We show that
the high energy limit is dominated by a saddle point that can be mapped onto an
equilibrium electro-static energy configuration of an assembly of $N$ pointlike
(Minkowskian) charges, together with a density of charges arising from the
Liouville field. We argue that the Liouville charges accumulate on segments of
curves, and produce quadratic branch cuts on the worldsheet. The
electro-statics problem is solved for string tree level in terms of
hyper-elliptic integrals and is given explicitly for 3- and 4-point functions.
We show that the high energy limit should behave in a string-like fashion with
exponential dependence on the energy scale for generic values of $c$.

difficulty of how to turn the traditional gauge transformation of the vector

at gauge transformations in a slightly different manner which, in addition,
does not require introducing any BRST-like parameter. This gauge transformation
does not appear explicitly in the group law of the symmetry but rather as the
trajectories associated with generalized equations of motion generated by
vector fields with null Noether invariants. In the new approach the parameters
of the local group, $U(1)(\vec{x},t)$, acquire dynamical content outside the
photon mass shell, a fact which also allows a unified quantization of both the

interactions with hadrons are included by conventional cascade-type two-body

data on $J/\Psi$ suppression from both proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus
collisions (including Pb + Pb) can be explained without assuming the formation
of a quark-gluon plasma in these collisions. Our microscopic studies thus
confirm the suggestion of Gavin et al. that $J/\Psi$ suppression observed in
nuclear collisions is largely due to absorption by comovers, i.e., the produced
mesons.

wave is studied for systems where the local reaction law exhibits a
period-doubling cascade to chaos. This structure is considerably more complex
than that of simple period-1 oscillatory media. As one moves from the core of
the spiral wave the local dynamics takes the form of perturbed period-doubled
orbits whose character varies with spatial location relative to the core. An
important feature of these media is the existence of a curve where the local
dynamics is effectively period-1. This curve arises as a consequence of the
necessity to reconcile the conflict between the global topological organization
of the medium induced by the presence of a spiral wave and the topological
phase space structure of local orbits determined by the reaction rate law. Due
to their general topological nature, the phenomena described here should be
observable in a broad class of systems with complex periodic behavior.
