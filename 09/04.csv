produce spurious heating of the gaseous component in numerical simulations of
galaxy formation. A simple analytic model demonstrates that this artificial
heating will dominate radiative cooling in any simulation where the mass of an
individual dark matter particle exceeds a certain critical value. This maximum
mass depends only on the cooling function of the gas, on the fraction of the
material in gaseous form, and (weakly) on typical temperatures in the gas. It
is comparable to, or smaller than, the dark matter particle masses employed in
most published simulations of cosmological hydrodynamics and galaxy formation.
Any simulation which violates this constraint will be unable to follow cooling
flows, although catastrophic cooling of gas may still occur in regions with
very short cooling times. We use a series of N--body/smoothed particle
hydrodynamics simulations to explore this effect. In simulations which neglect
radiative cooling, two--body heating causes a gradual expansion of the gas
component. When radiative effects are included, we find that gas cooling is
almost completely suppressed for dark matter particle masses above our limit.
Although our test simulations use smoothed particle hydrodynamics, similar
effects, and a similar critical mass, are expected in any simulation where the
dark matter is represented by discrete particles.

this end we use the secondary infall model of galactic halo formation which we
have generalized to take account of the angular momentum of the dark matter
particles. The new model is still spherically symmetric and it admits
self-similar solutions. In the absence of angular momentum, the model produces
flat rotation curves for a large range of values of a parameter $\epsilon$
which is related to the spectrum of primordial density perturbations. We find
that the presence of angular momentum produces an effective core radius, i.e.
it makes the contribution of the halo to the rotation curve go to zero at zero
radius. The model provides a detailed description of the large scale properties
of galactic halos including their density profiles, their extent and total
mass. We obtain predictions for the kinetic energies of the particles in the
velocity peaks and estimates for their local densities as functions of the
amount of angular momentum, the age of the universe and $\epsilon$.

pulsational brightness variations of a few percent with periods ranging from 19

that requires a long unbroken time series to resolve. Our CCD photometry of the
star covers a two-week period in 1991 November, and used a global network of

week in the middle of the run. We have identified 10 pulsation periods, ranging

nonradial g-modes. The ratios of the frequencies of the largest-amplitude modes

  Journal",,"10.1086/303611",,"astro-ph",,"  Besides the narrow peaks originating from the periodic signal, the power
spectra of accreting X-ray pulsars display continuum components usually
increasing towards low frequencies; these arise from the source aperiodic
variability. Most studies so far adopted the view that the periodic and
aperiodic variations are independent. However any aperiodic variability in the
emission from the accretion column(s) towards the magnetic neutron star should
be modulated at the X-ray pulsar period, by virtue of the same rotation-induced
geometric effects which give rise to the periodic signal. We develop here a
simple shot noise model to test the presence of a coupling between the periodic
and aperiodic variability of X-ray pulsars. The model power spectrum is fit to
the power spectra of three X-ray pulsars, Vela X-1, 4U 1145-62 and Cen X-3
observed with EXOSAT. In the first two cases we find that a highly significant
coupling is present, as testified by a substantialbroadening in the wings of
the power spectrum peaks due to the periodic modulation. We find also that
these wings can mimick the presence of a knee in the continuum power spectrum
components around the fundamental of the periodic modulation, therefore
questioning the correlation reported by Takeshima (1992) between the X-ray
pulsar frequency and the knee frequency, beyond which the continuum power
spectral component steepens.

parameter Omega in the quasi-linear regime. This dependence is particularly
interesting as it does not involve the possible bias between the galaxy spatial
distribution and the underlying mass distribution. This implies a new and
promising method for determining a bias-independent value of Omega based on a
reliable determination of the velocity divergence PDF.
  In this paper we study the Omega dependence of the velocity divergence PDF
and its first moments in a set of N-body simulations, using the so-called
Voronoi and Delaunay methods. We show that this dependence is in agreement with
the theoretical prediction, even while the number density of velocity field
tracers has been diluted to a value comparable to that available in current
galaxy catalogues.
  In addition, we demonstrate that a sufficiently reliable determination of
these statistical quantities is also possible when the measurement of the

discriminate between low and high Omega.

earlier work of Grubb and Seeley. As an application we give another proof of
the gluing formula for the eta invariant. Our class of boundary conditions
contains as special cases the usual (nonlocal) Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary
value problems as well as the (local) relative and absolute boundary conditions
for the Gauss-Bonnet operator.

tensor is derived from a scalar potential that determines the volume element of

for various types of matter fields. Some of their properties are discussed. In
particular, we show that gauge fields can interact minimally with the torsion

number of improvements over previous treatments, including a consistent
treatment of Goldstone bosons in $V_{eff}$, an accurate analytic approximation
to $V_{eff}$ valid for any mass-to-temperature ratios, and use of the
experimentally measured top quark mass. For two-Higgs doublet models, we
identify a significant region of parameter space where $\phi_c/T_c$ is large
enough for electroweak baryogenesis, and we argue that this identification
should persist even at higher orders in perturbation theory. In the case of the
minimal supersymmetric standard model, our results indicate that the extra
Higgs bosons have little effect on the strength of the phase transition.

enhances the expected event rate of the supernova relic neutrino background
(SRN) at the Super-Kamiokande detector (SK). The SRN \bar\nu_e's can be almost
completely exchanged with \nu_\mu-like neutrinos by the MSW oscillation under
the inverse mass hierarchy with \Delta m^2 ~ 10^{-8}--10^5 [eV^2], or by the
magnetic moment of Majorana neutrinos with \mu_\nu >~ 10^{-12} \mu_B and \Delta
m^2 ~ 10^{-4}--10^0 [eV^2]. In the standard calculation of the SRN flux, the
event rate of the SRN \bar\nu_e's at the SK in the observable energy range of
15--40 MeV can be enhanced from 1.2 yr^{-1} to 2.4 yr^{-1} if all \bar\nu_e's
are exchanged with \nu_\mu-like neutrinos. The enhancement is prominent
especially in the high energy range (\gtilde 25 MeV). In the astrophysically
optimistic calculation, the event rate becomes as high as 9.4 yr^{-1}. Because
the theoretical upper bound of the SRN events without oscillation is about 5
yr^{-1} taking account of the various astrophysical uncertainties, we might
have to resort to the neutrino oscillation if more than 5 events in a year, as
well as a significantly harder spectrum, were observed in the SK.

particle production in p+S and S+A collisions. The different techniques show
consistent results. Strangeness conservation in full phase space is used as an
additional check of the consistency of the data.
  On the base of the analysis in full phase space it could be shown that
strangeness conservation is fullfilled. The NA35 K$^0_S$ in S+S and S+Ag are
consistent with the NA44 results for K$^+$ and K$^-$. The results of the NA36
collaboration for S+Pb collisions were extrapolated to full phase space. The
comparison with the NA35 results shows more than two times lower yields. The
ratio of $\Lambda$ to $\overline{\Lambda}$ at midrapidity of NA36 is
inconsistent with the high baryon density determind by NA35. The strange
particle production is compared to the abundance of non strange particles,
especially negatively charged pions which are measured in full phase space in
the same experiment. A clear enhanced strange hadron production relative to
$\pi^-$ is observed in S+Ag collisions compared to p+S reactions at the same
energy. The K$^0_S$ multiplicity in full phase space per negative hadron
(h$^-$) in S+S, S+Ag and Pb+Pb is enhanced by about a factor 1.6 compared to
N+N and p+S collisions. The NA36 result for the K$^0_S$ multiplicity per h$^-$
in S+Pb is below the N+N value.
