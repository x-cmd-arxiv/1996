extensive new catalog of heavy element QSO absorbers. The catalog permits
exploration of clustering over a large range in both scale (from about 1 to
over 300 Mpc) and redshift (z from 1.2 to 4.5). We find significant evidence
(5.0 sigma) that C IV absorbers are clustered on comoving scales of 100 Mpc and
less --- similar to the size of voids and walls found in galaxy redshift
surveys of the local universe --- with a mean correlation function $\xi = 0.42
\pm 0.10$ over these scales. We find, on these scales, that the mean
correlation function at low (z=1.7), medium (z=2.4), and high redshift (z=3.0)
is $\xi=0.40 \pm 0.17$, $0.32 \pm 0.14$, and $0.72 \pm 0.25$, respectively.
Thus, the superclustering is present even at high redshift; furthermore, it
does not appear that the superclustering scale, in comoving coordinates, has
changed significantly since then. We find 7 QSOs with rich groups of absorbers
(potential superclusters) that account for a significant portion of the
clustering signal, with 2 at redshift $z\sim 2.8$. We find that the
superclustering is just as evident if we take $q_0=0.1$ instead of 0.5;
however, the inferred scale of clustering is then 240 Mpc , which is larger
than the largest scales of clustering known at present. This discrepancy may be
indicative of a larger value of $q_0$, and hence $\Omega_0$. The evolution of
the correlation function on 50 Mpc scales is consistent with that expected in
cosmologies with density parameter ranging from $\Omega_0 = $ 0.1 to 1.
Finally, we find no evidence for clustering on scales greater than 100 Mpc
($q_0=0.5$) or 240 Mpc ($q_0=0.1$).

small-scale relative pairwise peculiar velocity dispersions from the cosmic
virial theorem (CVT). Specifically we evaluate the effect by incorporating the
finite core radius $r_c$ in the two-point correlation function of mass, i.e.
$\xi_\rho(r) \propto (r+r_c)^{-\gamma}$ and the effective gravitational force
softening $r_s$ on small scales. We analytically obtain the lowest-order
correction term for $\gamma <2$ which is in quantitative agreement with the
full numerical evaluation. With a nonzero $r_s$ and/or $r_c$ the cosmic virial
theorem is no longer limited to the case of $\gamma<2$. We present accurate
fitting formulae for the CVT predicted pairwise velocity dispersion for the
case of $\gamma>2$. Compared with the idealistic point-mass approximation
($r_s=r_c=0$), the finite size effect can significantly reduce the small-scale
velocity dispersions of galaxies at scales much larger than $r_s$ and $r_c$.
Even without considering the finite size of galaxies, nonzero values for $r_c$
are generally expected, for instance, for cold dark matter (CDM) models with a
scale-invariant primordial spectrum. For these CDM models, a reasonable force
softening $r_s\le 100 \hikpc$ would have rather tiny effect. We present the CVT
predictions for the small-scale pairwise velocity dispersion in the CDM models
normalized by the COBE observation. The implication of our results for
confrontation of observations of galaxy pair-wise velocity dispersions and
theoretical predictions of the CVT is also discussed.

reject the claim that such a halo can affect the estimation of the primordial
spectral index and amplitude of density perturbations as inferred from the DMR

plausible contribution of such an X-ray emitting halo to a distortion in the
CMB spectrum (as specified by the Compton-y parameter), up to a value for R --
the ratio of the core radius of the isothermal halo gas distribution to the
distance to the Local Group centroid -- of 0.68. For larger values of R, the
recent cosmological upper limit derived by COBE-FIRAS provides stronger
constraints on the model parameters. Over the entire parameter space for R, we
find an upper limit to the inferred sky-RMS anisotropy signal of 14 microKelvin

the energies and correlation functions of the low-lying excited states of the

small clusters amenable to exact diagonalization studies in 2-D and have

coupling non-pertubatively. We find important contributions to E(anis) due to
the lifting of band degeneracies near the Fermi level by SOC. The important
role of degeneracies is supported by the calculation of the electron
temperature dependence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, which
decreases with the temperature increasing on a scale of several hundred K. In
general, E(anis) scales with the square of the SOC constant. Including 4s bands
and s-d hybridization, the combined interpolation scheme yields anisotropy
energies that quantitatively agree well with experiments for Fe and Ni
monolayers on Cu(001). Finally, the anisotropy energy is calculated for systems
of up to 14 layers. Even after including s-bands and for multilayers, the
importance of degeneracies persists. Considering a fixed fct-Fe structure, we
find a reorientation of the magnetization from perpendicular to in-plane at
about 4 layers. For Ni, we find the correct in-plane easy-axis for the

It is demonstrated that previously proposed amplitudes for this process, both

origin of the Pauli principle violation is shown to come from two sources: (i)
For the (s,t) class, the two-s-two-t amplitude transforms into the two-s-two-u
amplitude under the interchange of two initial-state (or final-state) protons.
(ii) For the (u,t) class, the use of an internal emission amplitude determined
from the gauge-invariance constraint alone, without imposition of the Pauli
principle, causes a problem. The resulting internal emission amplitude can
depend upon an electromagnetic factor which is not invariant under the
interchange of the two protons.

impedance Z_s = R_s+iX_s of YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-x} thin films was measured using
suspended patterned resonators. Z_s(H) is shown to be a direct measure of the
flux density B(H) enabling a very precise test of models of flux penetration.
Three regimes of field-dependent behavior were observed: (1) Initial flux
penetration occurs on very low field scales H_i(4.2K) 100Oe, (2) At moderate
fields the flux penetration into the virgin state is in excellent agreement
with calculations based upon the field-induced Bean critical state for thin
film geometry, parametrized by a field scale H_s(4.2K) J_c*d 0.5T, (3) for very
high fields H >>H_s, the flux density is uniform and the measurements enable
direct determination of vortex parameters such as pinning force constants
\alpha_p and vortex viscosity \eta. However hysteresis loops are in
disagreement with the thin film Bean model, and instead are governed by the low
field scale H_i, rather than by H_s. Geometric barriers are insufficient to
account for the observed results.
