beta-graded, CERN type, four cell cavities at 352 MHz is presented. The high
energy part (100 MeV-1 GeV) of the machine is split in three beta-graded
sections, and transverse focusing is provided via a periodic doublet array. All
the parameters, like power in the couplers and accelerating fields in the
cavities, are within the state of the art, achieved in operating machines. A
first stage of operation at 30 mA beam current is proposed, while the upgrade
of the machine to 120 mA operation can be obtained increasing the number of
klystrons and couplers per cavity. The additional coupler ports, up to four,
will be integrated in the cavity design. Preliminary calculations indicate that
beam transport is feasible, given the wide aperture of the 352 MHz structures.
A capital cost of less than 100 M$ at 10 mA, reaching up to 280 M$ for the 120
mA extension, has been estimated for the superconducting high energy section
(100 MeV-1 GeV). The high efficiency of the proposed machine, reaching 50% at
15 mA, makes it a good candidate for proposed nuclear waste incineration
facilities and Energy Amplifier studies.

which a periodic array of pinning centres is present is dealt with by means of
a renormalization group (RG) approach in frequency space. This yields an

nucleation rate on the externally-driven supercurrent. In this formula the rate
dependence displays oscillations which are connected to the pinning periodicity
and correspond to the vortex nucleation length probing over the pinning sites

how, with improved statistical errors, and with calculations of the masses of
baryons containing non-degenerate quarks, there is now a clear need for
extrapolations of higher order than linear in the quark mass. I describe how
QChPT makes predictions for the functional forms to use in such extrapolations,
and emphasize the distinction between contributions coming from chiral loops
which are similar to those present in unquenched theories, and those from
$\eta'$ loops which are pure quenched artifacts. I describe a fit to the baryon
masses using the predictions of QChPT. I give a status report on the numerical
evidence for $\eta'$ loops, concluding that they are likely present, and are
characterized by a coupling $\delta=0.1-0.2$. I use the difference between
chiral loops in QCD and quenched QCD to estimate the quenching errors in a
variety of quantities. I then turn to results for matrix elements, largely from
quenched simulations. Results for quenched decay constants cannot yet be
reliably extrapolated to the continuum limit. By contrast, new results for
$B_K$ suggest a continuum, ``quenched'' value of $B_K(NDR, 2 GeV) = 0.5977 \pm
0.0064 \pm 0.0166$, based on a quadratic extrapolation in $a$. The theoretical
basis for using a quadratic extrapolation has been confirmed. For the first
time there is significant evidence that unquenching changes $B_K$, and my
estimate for the value in QCD is $B_K(NDR, 2 GeV) = 0.66 \pm 0.02 \pm 0.11$.
Here the second error is a conservative estimate of the systematic error due to
uncertainties in the effect of quenching. A less conservative viewpoint reduces
$0.11$ to $0.03$.

particle-antiparticle mixing in inclusive channels of neutral $B$ meson decay.
Not only are the branching ratios sizable, at the 1% to 50% level, but some of
those asymmetries are expected to be large because of substantial CKM phases.
The inclusive sum partially dilutes the asymmetries, but the dilution factor is
calculable, assuming local quark-hadron duality, and CKM parameters can be
reliably extracted. We discuss in detail the determination of $sin 2\alpha$
from charmless final states in decays of $B_d$ mesons and survey the
asymmetries for other inclusive final states. While probably not yet sensitive
to standard model predictions, meaningful CP violation studies can be conducted
with existing data samples of inclusive neutral $B$ decays.

They give rise, via the Poisson-Lie $T$-duality, to a rich structure of the

characterized by their shapes and certain two-forms living on them. The WZNW
path integral for the interacting $D$-branes diagrams is unambiguously defined

compactification on manifolds of exceptional holonomy gives rise to
superconformal field theories with extended chiral algebras. In their paper,
free field realisations are given of these extended superconformal algebras
inspired by Joyce's constructions of such manifolds as desingularised toroidal
orbifolds. The purpose of this note is to give another realisation of these
algebras starting not from free fields, but from the superconformal algebras
associated to Calabi--Yau manifolds. These superconformal algebras, originally
studied by Odake, are extensions of the N=2 Virasoro algebra. For the case of
G_2 holonomy, our realisation is inspired in the conjectured construction of
such manifolds as a desingularisation of (K x S^1)/Z_2, where K is a
Calabi--Yau 3-fold admitting an antiholomorphic involution. Similarly, for the
case of Spin(7) holonomy our realisation suggests a construction of such
manifolds as desingularisations of K'/Z_2, where K' is a Calabi-Yau 4-fold
admitting an antiholomorphic involution.

$\sigma$-model (including a dilaton field associated with broken scale
invariance) at finite baryon density $\rho$ and nonzero temperature $T$. The
explicit breaking of chiral symmetry and the way the vector meson mass is
generated are significant for the appearance of a phase of nearly vanishing
nucleon mass besides the solution describing normal nuclear matter. The
elimination of the abnormal solution prohibits the onset of a chiral phase
transition but allows to lower the compressibility to a reasonable range. The
repulsive contributions from the vector mesons are responsible for the wide
range of stability of the normal phase in the $(\mu,T)$-plane. The abnormal
solution becomes not only energetically preferable to the normal state at high
temperature or density, but also mechanically stable due to the inclusion of
dilatons.

bosonic gap equation, is pointed out and discussed in detail. The critical
temperature for condensation of pion pairs (Evans--Rashid transition) is
determined as a function of the pion density. As for fermions, this phase
transition is signaled by the appearance of a pole in the two--particle
propagator. In bose systems there exists a second, lower critical temperature,
associated with the appearance of the single--particle condensate. Between the
two critical temperatures the pion dispersion relation changes from the usual
quasiparticle dispersion to a Bogoliubov--like dispersion relation at low
momenta. This generalizes the non-relativistic result for an attractive bose
gas by Evans et al. Possible consequences for the inclusive pion spectra
measured in heavy--ion collisions at ultra--relativistic energies are
discussed.
