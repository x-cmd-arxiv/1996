bundle of polarization of type (1,n). For n>9, we show that the ideal of a

the embedding is Heisenberg invariant, we give a very specific description of
these quadrics. These quadrics are produced using a generalization of the Moore
matrices which yields a uniform description of these ideals. We prove that
these equations generate the ideals using a degeneration argument, degenerating
abelian surfaces to schemes obtained from Stanley-Reisner ideals of certain
triangulations of the torus. Furthermore, we obtain information on how to
compute the moduli spaces of abelian surfaces of type (1,n) with canonical
level structure. In a sequel to this paper, we will study the structure of the
equations for n<=9, and also give detailed geometric descriptions for the
moduli spaces of abelian surfaces of low degree.

predicted by the scaling ansatz which is, however, forced to match the linear
evolution on scales larger than the simulation box. In any case, the scaling
ansatz by Baugh & Gaztanaga (1996), calibrated against large box simulations
agrees better with ZA predictions on large scales, keeping good accuracy also
on intermediate scales. We show that mode-coupling is able to move the first
zero crossing of xi(r) as time goes on. A detailed fit of the time dependence
of this shifting is given for a CDM model. The evolution of the cross
correlation of the density fluctuation field evaluated at two different times

also discuss the various objections to this hypothesis. We assume that there
was a magnetic field present in the galactic plasma before the galaxy formed.
After the galactic disk formed, the lines of force thread through it and remain
connected to the external cosmic medium. They enter through one side of the
disk, proceed horizontally a distance $ l $ in the disk, and then leave through
the other side. We find that the lines of force are stretched rotation of the
galactic disk, which amplifies the toroidal component of the field and
increases$l $. When the magnetic field is strong enough, it produces ambipolar
velocities that try to lift the line out of the galactic disk but in opposite
directions ondifferent parts of the line. The result is, instead of the line
being expelled from the disk, its horizontal length $l $ is shortened, both in
the radial, and in the toroidal direction. This leads to a reduction of the
rate of horizontal stretching, and, finally, a reduction in the magnetic field
strength. After a sufficient time, the magnetic field at all points goes
through this stretching and reduction, and the field strength approaches a
universal function of time. This function is slowly decreasing, and only
depends on the ambipolar propertiesof the interstellar medium. At any given
time the magnetic field is toroidal, and has the same strength almost
everywhere. On the other hand, it turns out that its direction varies rapidly
with radius, changing sign every one hundred parsecs field dominate over that
of the other. The resulting field has a net Faraday rotation. If such a field
were observed with low resolution in an external galaxy then the field would
appear toroidal in between the spiral arms. The spiral density wave would turn
it so that the lines appear to trace out the spiral arm,

considerable effects on this conversion. Such effects may be seen in a
supernova in the Large or Small Magellanic Clouds, and should be taken into

homogeneous models. We then specialize to those inhomogeneous toroidal models

equations which govern the (conformally rescaled) displacement of the
inhomogeneous flow with respect to its homogeneous background. Finally, we set

  July 1, 1997",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.56.R489",,"cond-mat.str-el",,"  We investigate a model where an impurity couples to both the spin and the
flavor currents of the two channel conduction electrons. This model can be used
as a prototype model of a magnetic impurity tunneling between two sites in a
metal and of some heavy fermion systems where the ground state of the impurity
has a fourfold degeneracy. The system is shown to flow to a doubly degenerate
non fermi-liquid(NFL) fixed point; the thermodynamic quantities show NFL
behaviors, but the transport quantities show fermi liquid (FL) behaviors . A
spin-flavor coupling double tensor term is shown to drive the system to one of
the two singlet FL fixed points. The relation with SU(4) Coqblin-Schrieffer
model is studied. The implications on the possible experiments are given.

QCD-like theories, transforming it to many different phases. We review what is
known about them, both from lattice and non-lattice approaches. A particularly
simple mechanism of the QCD chiral restoration phase transition is discussed
first: it suggests that it is a transition from randomly placed tunneling
events (instantons) at low T to strongly localized tunneling-anti-tunneling
pairs at high T. Many features of the transition found on the lattice can be
explained in this simple picture. Very relevant for RHIC, this approach
predicts a strong non-perturbative interaction between quarks $above$ the phase
transition. It also predicts that QGP-like phase sets in at $zero$ temperature,
provided few more light quark flavors are added to QCD. Finally, we also
discuss possible experimental signatures of the QCD phase transition. One issue
is CERN dilepton data, possibly related with ``dropping'' masses of $\rho, A_1$
mesons. Another is direct manifestation of a $softeness$ of EOS (smallness of
pressure/energy density) in the phase transition region in flow and even the
global lifetime of the system.

important part of the $s \rightarrow d$ transition, the so-called self-penguin
amplitude $\sim G_F \alpha_s$, including the heavy top-quark case. Second, we
calculate the matrix element of the $s \rightarrow d$ transition for the
physical $K \rightarrow 2 \pi$ process. This part of the analysis is performed
within the Chiral Quark Model where quarks are coupled to the pseudoscalar
mesons. The CP-conserving self-penguin contribution to $K \rightarrow 2\pi$ is
found to be negligible. The obtained contribution to $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ is
sensitive to the values of the quark condensate $<\bar{q} q>$ and the
constituent quark mass $M$. For reasonable values of these quantities we find
that the self-penguin contribution to $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ is 10-15% of the
gluonic penguin contribution and has the same sign. Given the large
cancellation between gluonic and electroweak penguin contributions, this means
that our contribution is of the same order of magnitude as $\epsilon'/\epsilon$
itself.

generalized from a similar construction developed in the Gross-Neveu model, to
evaluate the basic order parameters of the dynamical breaking of the $SU(2)_L
\times SU(2)_R$ and $SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R$ chiral symmetries in QCD. The
method starts with a reorganization of the ordinary perturbation theory with
the addition of an arbitrary quark mass $m$. The new perturbative series can be
summed to all orders thanks to renormalization group properties, with specific
boundary conditions, and advocated analytic continuation in $m$ properties. In
the approximation where the explicit breakdown of the chiral symmetries due to
small current quark masses is neglected, we derive ansatzes for the dynamical
contribution to the ""constituent"" masses $M_q$ of the $u,d,s$ quarks; the pion
decay constant $F_\pi$; and the quark condensate $< \bar q q > $ in terms of
the basic QCD scale $\Lambda_{\bar{MS}} $. Those ansatzes are then optimized,
in a sense to be specified, and also explicit symmetry breaking mass terms can
be consistently introduced in the framework. The obtained values of $F_\pi$ and
$M_q$ are roughly in agreement with what is expected from other
non-perturbative methods. In contrast we obtain quite a small value of $|< \bar
q q >|$ within our approach. The possible interpretation of the latter results
is briefly discussed.
