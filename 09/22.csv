  figures available at ftp://kusmos.phsx.ukans.edu/preprints/discrete",,"10.1086/310590",,"astro-ph",,"  Two-body scattering and other discreteness effects are unimportant in
cosmological gravitational clustering in most scenarios, since the dark matter
has a small particle mass. The collective field should determine evolution:
Two-body scattering in simulations violates the Poisson-Vlasov equations. We
test this in PM, P$^3$M, Tree, and NGPM codes, noting that a collisionless code
will preserve the one-dimensional character of plane wave collapse. We find
collisionality vanishing as the softening parameter approaches the mean
interparticle separation. Solutions for the problem are suggested, involving
greater computer power, PM-based nested grid codes, and a more conservative
approach to resolution claims.

couplings with variance $J$ and non-vanishing mean value $J_0$ are studied
using the zero-temperature domain-wall renormalization group (DWRG). The DWRG
trajectories in the ($J_0,J$) plane after rescaling can be collapsed on two
curves: one for $J_0/J > r_c$ and other for $J_0/J < r_c$. In the first case
the DWRG flows are toward the ferromagnetic fixed point both in two and three
dimensions while in the second case flows are towards a paramagnetic fixed
point and spin-glass fixed point in two and three dimensions respectively. No
evidence for an extra phase is found.

the effect of anisotropic (momentum-dependent) impurity scattering is given. It
is shown that for a strongly anisotropic scattering the reduction of the
pair-breaking effect of the impurities is large. For a significant overlap
between the anisotropy functions of the scattering potential and that of the
pair potential and for a large amount of anisotropic scattering rate in
impurity potential the superconductivity becomes robust vis a vis impurity
concentration. The implications of our result for YBCO high-temperature
superconductor are discussed.

being regularly exposed to low energy, low intensity pulses of some type of
quanta is studied. Assuming a randomness condition on the interaction of these
quanta with the system, but making no assumptions about the accessible states
of the system, we show that microcanonical equilibrium is reached. Although the
intensity of the pulses is assumed to be weak the interactions are treated
exactly, with no recourse to perturbation theory. The origin of time asymmetry
and the absence of recurrence is discussed.

to recover classical spacetime, at least approximately. However, quantum
gravity may eventually provide classical spacetimes by giving spectral data
similar to those appearing in noncommutative geometry, rather than by giving
directly a spacetime manifold. It is shown that a globally hyperbolic
Lorentzian manifold can be given by spectral data. A new phenomenon in the
context of spectral geometry is observed: causal relationships. The employment
of the causal relationships of spectral data is shown to lead to a highly
efficient description of Lorentzian manifolds, indicating the possible
usefulness of this approach. Connections to free quantum field theory are
discussed for both motivation and physical interpretation. It is conjectured
that the necessary spectral data can be generically obtained from an effective
field theory having the fundamental structures of generalized quantum
mechanics: a decoherence functional and a choice of histories.

testing the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) origin of CP violation through a
determination of the three angles of the CKM matrix unitarity triangle. Other
sources of CP nonconservation violate SM constraints on the unitarity triangle.
We show that different models of physics beyond the SM can be distinguished by
combining their effects in CP asymmetries and in rare flavor-changing $B$
decays.
