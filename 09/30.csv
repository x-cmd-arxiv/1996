those measured by the Keck HIRES and earlier high spectral resolution
observations over the column density range 10^{12} < NHI < 10^{16}. In
particular, we find a power-law column density distribution persists to the
lowest values reported from the HIRES measurements, in agreement with the
incompleteness-corrected observations. We find evolution in the cloud number
density and opacity comparable to the observed evolution. We also compare with
measured values of the intergalactic HeII opacity. Our results require a HeII
ionizing background lower than the Haardt & Madau estimate by a factor of 4,

yield the following major conclusions. The metallicity distribution of the
closed box, simple model for the chemical evolution of galaxies is not able to
account for Mg2 and Fe52, Fe53 values in excess of 0.27,3 and 2.7,
respectively, which are observed in the nuclei of a large fraction of
Ellipticals. To reproduce the line strengths in these galaxies high average
metallicities, small metallicity dispersion and old ages are required. In
particular, Mg2 values of 0.3 are reproduced only with a metallicity
distribution ranging from 0.5\Zsun to 3\Zsun, and 15 Gyr old stellar
populations. I interpret the data as indicating that the gas out of which the
nuclei of ellipticals formed was pre-enriched, to larger metallicities for
increasing \Mgtw.The presence of a metallicity dispersion does not alter the
relation between Mg2 and Iron indices with respect to the SSP models. Thus, the
need for a Mg/Fe overabundance in the strongest lined galaxies is confirmed,
and I present a simple way to estimate the [Mg/Fe] ratio on the basis of
existing models with solar abundance ratios.

considering the path integral description of the quantum statistical mechanics
of such systems, which takes the form of the {\em classical} statistical
mechanics of a system in which time appears as an extra dimension. In
particular, this allows the deduction of scaling forms for the finite
temperature behavior, which turns out to be described by the theory of finite
size scaling. It also leads naturally to the notion of a temperature-dependent
dephasing length that governs the crossover between quantum and classical
fluctuations. We illustrate these ideas using Josephson junction arrays and

assume that there is no correlation between random potentials in different

corresponding to the same energy, may cross each other. We show that, if the
tunnel coupling between the layers exceeds some characteristic value (which is
much smaller than the width of the Landau level), then the probability for an
electron to switch equipotential (and, thus, the layer) at the intersection is
close to one. As a result, the structure of each delocalized state in a
double--layer system becomes completely different from that for an isolated
layer. The state is composed of alternating pieces of equipotentials from
different planes. These combined equipotentials form a percolation network. We
demonstrate that the regions, where equipotentials from different planes touch
each other, play the role of saddle points for such a network. The energy
separation between two delocalized states is of the order of the width of the
Landau level, and the critical exponent of the localization length is
$7/3$--the same as for an isolated layer.

$r$--matrix interpretation is elaborated. The $r$--matrix structure turns out
to be related to a highly nonlocal quadratic Poisson structure on a direct sum
of associative algebras. The theory of such nonlocal structures is developed,
the Poisson property of the monodromy map is worked out in the most general
situation. Some problems concerning the duality of Lax representations are
raised.
