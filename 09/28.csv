observed with ASCA during its PV phase. The 0.5-10 keV X-ray spectrum consists
of multiple components; (1) a continuum component heavily absorbed by a column
density NH = 4E23 cm-2 above 3 keV; (2) a strong 6.4 keV line (EW = 500 eV);
(3) a weak flat continuum between 1 and 3 keV; and (4) excess soft X-ray
emission below 1 keV. The detection of strong absorption for the hard X-ray
component is firm evidence for an obscured active nucleus in this Seyfert 2
galaxy. The absorption corrected X-ray luminosity is about 2E42 erg/s. This is
the first time that the fluorescent iron-K line has been detected in this
object. The flat spectrum in the intermediate energy range may be a scattered
continuum from the central source. The soft X-ray emission below 1 keV can be
thermal emission from a temperature kT = 0.5 keV, consistent with the spatially
extended emission observed by ROSAT HRI. However, the low abundance (0.05 Zs)
and high mass flow rate required for the thermal model and an iron-K line
stronger than expected from the obscuring torus model are puzzling. An
alternative consistent solution can be obtained if the central source was a
hundred times more luminous over than a thousand years ago. All the X-ray
emission below 3 keV is then scattered radiation.

characterizes the experimental device and is independent of a specific state of
the measured system. We also derive operational homodyne observables for the
setup with a random phase, which has been recently applied in an ultrafast
measurement of the photon statistics of a pulsed diode laser. The operational
formulation directly gives the relation between the detected noise and the
intrinsic quantum fluctuations of the measured field. We demonstrate this on
two examples: the operational uncertainty relation for the field quadratures,
and the homodyne detection of suppressed fluctuations in photon statistics.

frustrated 2D XY models. In the spirit of Villain's approach for the
ferromagnetic case we divide thermal excitations into a low temperature long
wavelength part (LW) and a high temperature short wavelength part (SW). In the
present work we mainly deal with LW excitations and we explicitly consider the
cases of the fully frustrated triangular (FFTXY) and square ( FFSQXY) XY
models. The novel aspect of our method is that it preserves the coupling
between phase (spin angles) and chiral degrees of freedom. LW fluctuations
consist of coupled phase and chiral excitations. As a result, we find that for
frustrated systems the effective interactions between phase variables is long
range and oscillatory in contrast to the unfrustrated problem. Using Monte
Carlo (MC) simulations we show that our analytical calculations produce
accurate results at all temperature $T$; this is seen at low $T$ in the spin
wave stiffness constant and in the staggered chirality; this is also the case
near $T_c$: transitions are driven by the SW part associated with domain walls
and vortices, but the coupling between phase and chiral variables is still
relevant in the critical region. In that regime our analytical results yield
the correct $T$ dependence for bare couplings (given by the LW fluctuations)
such as the Coulomb gas temperature $T_{CG}$ of the frustrated XY models . In
particular we find that $T_{CG}$ tracks chiral rather than phase fluctuations.
Our results provides support for a single phase transition scenario in the
FFTXY and FFSQXY models.

related to de Rham differential on the moduli space of decorated super-Riemann
surfaces P. We develop formalism where superstring amplitudes are computed via
integration of some differential forms over a section of P over the super
moduli space M. We show that the result of integration does not depend on the
choice of section when all the states are BRST physical. Our approach is based
on the geometrical theory of integration on supermanifolds of which we give a
short review.

non-critical strings in the limit where the energy of all external states is
large compared to the string tension. We show that the high energy limit is
dominated by a saddle point that can be mapped onto an electrostatic
equilibrium configuration of an assembly of charges associated with the
external states, together with a density of charges arising from the Liouville
field. The Liouville charges accumulate on line segments, which produce
quadratic branch cuts on the worldsheet. The electrostatics problem is solved
for string tree level in terms of hyperelliptic integrals and is given
explicitly for the 3- and 4-point functions. For generic values of the central
charge, the high energy limit behaves in a string-like fashion, with
exponential energy dependence.

increasing nuclear matter density affect nuclear properties under normal as

for the mode in which chiral symmetry is manifested is expected to change as
matter density or temperature is changed. The topics discussed are ``BR
scaling,"" its connection to the structure of nuclei in Landau's Fermi liquid
theory and a variety of consequences on such nuclear properties as effective
nucleon mass, nuclear gyromagnetic ratios, $g_A^\star$, axial-charge
transitions in nuclei and on the fluctuations of nuclear matter into the
strange-flavor direction as observed in heavy-ion collisions. I will also
present a simple explanation of the recent dilepton data in the CERN-CERES
heavy-ion experiments involving densities greater than that of nuclear matter
and of the Indiana results on the longitudinally polarized proton scattering
from heavy nuclei, evidencing dropping vector-meson masses in medium which can
be interpreted as signaling an aspect of chiral symmetry restoration in dense
medium. The test of BR scaling provides a bridge between the physics of extreme
conditions (e.g. relativistic heavy-ion collisions) and the physics of normal
conditions which has conventional descriptions, thereby setting the stage for
formulating many-body theory for nuclear matter starting from an effective
chiral Lagrangian.

storage. Quantum channels have dual uses: they can be used to transmit known
quantum states which code for classical information, and they can be used in a
purely quantum manner, for transmitting or storing quantum entanglement. We
propose here a definition of the von Neumann capacity of quantum channels,
which is a quantum mechanical extension of the Shannon capacity and reverts to
it in the classical limit. As such, the von Neumann capacity assumes the role
of a classical or quantum capacity depending on the usage of the channel. In
analogy to the classical construction, this capacity is defined as the maximum
von Neumann mutual entropy processed by the channel, a measure which reduces to
the capacity for classical information transmission through quantum channels
(the ""Kholevo capacity"") when known quantum states are sent. The quantum mutual
entropy fulfills all basic requirements for a measure of information, and
observes quantum data-processing inequalities. We also derive a quantum Fano
inequality relating the quantum loss of the channel to the fidelity of the
quantum code. The quantities introduced are calculated explicitly for the
quantum ""depolarizing"" channel. The von Neumann capacity is interpreted within
the context of superdense coding, and an ""extended"" Hamming bound is derived
that is consistent with that capacity.

``polynomial'' subalgebras that can be consistently quantized, and completely
characterize the quantizations thereof. This example provides support for one
of the conjectures in Gotay et al 1996, but disproves part of another. Passing
to coverings, we also derive a no-go result for $R^2$ which is comparatively
stronger than those originally found by Groenewold and Van Hove.
