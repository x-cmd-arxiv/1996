  Astrophysical Journal","ApJ (1997) 481, 838-856","10.1086/304069",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a theoretical interpretation of the broad silicon and iron UV
absorption features observed with the Hubble Space Telescope in the spectrum of
the Schweizer-Middleditch star behind the remnant of Supernova 1006. These
features are caused by supernova ejecta in SN1006. We propose that the
redshifted SiII2 1260 A feature consists of both unshocked and shocked SiII.
The sharp red edge of the line at 7070 km/s indicates the position of the
reverse shock, while its Gaussian blue edge reveals shocked Si with a mean
velocity of 5050 km/s and a dispersion of 1240 km/s, implying a reverse shock
velocity of 2860 km/s. The measured velocities satisfy the energy jump
condition for a strong shock, provided that all the shock energy goes into
ions, with little or no collisionless heating of electrons. The line profiles
of the SiIII and SiIV absorption features indicate that they arise mostly from
shocked Si. The total mass of shocked and unshocked Si inferred from the SiII,
SiIII and SiIV profiles is M_Si = 0.25 \pm 0.01 Msun on the assumption of
spherical symmetry. Unshocked Si extends upwards from 5600 km/s. Although there
appears to be some Fe mixed with the Si at lower velocities < 7070 km/s, the
absence of FeII absorption with the same profile as the shocked SiII suggests
little Fe mixed with Si at higher (before being shocked) velocities. The column
density of shocked SiII is close to that expected for SiII undergoing steady
state collisional ionization behind the reverse shock, provided that the
electron to SiII ratio is low, from which we infer that most of the shocked Si
is likely to be of a fairly high degree of purity, unmixed with other elements.
We propose that the ambient interstellar density on the far side of SN1006 is
anomalously low compared to the density around the rest of the remnant. This

stars based on neutron star atmosphere models can be used not only to evaluate
the neutron star effective temperature, but also to determine chemical
composition of its surface. To demonstrate how this new method can be applied
to a specific object, we chose the old isolated neutron star candidate
RXJ1856.5-3754, whose soft X-ray radiation has been studied recently by Walter
et al. (1996). We fitted the soft X-ray spectrum of this object with neutron
star atmosphere models of different chemical compositions and used these fits
to calculate the source spectrum over a broad wavelength range. We showed, in
particular, that the optical/UV flux expected from this object depends
drastically on the composition of its surface. In particular, the neutron star
covered with hydrogen would be 5-6 magnitudes brighter than the neutron star
with an iron surface. The object should also be observable with $EUVE$; the EUV
flux is expected to be almost twice higher for the iron surface than for the
hydrogen one. Thus, multiwavelength observations of this object would enable
one to examine, for the first time, chemical composition of the neutron star
surface. The method proposed can be applied to other nearby isolated neutron
stars.

standard method, no saddle-point approximation is made, and no massive modes
have to be eliminated. This first paper on the subject applies the generalized
Hubbard-Stratonovitch transformation to Dyson's Circular Unitary Ensemble. It
is shown how to use a supersymmetric variant of the

expressed a desire for a finer structure - of finitary character (when we have
a structure theorem at all). I point out that the logic L_{infty,aleph_0}(d.q.)
(d.q. stands for dimension quantifier) does not suffice: e.g., for T=Th(lambda
x 2^\omega,E_n)_{n<omega} where (alpha,eta)E_n(beta,nu) =: eta|n=nu|n and for a
subset S of 2^omega we define
  M_S = M | {(alpha,eta): [eta in S -> alpha<omega_1] and [eta in 2^\omega
backslash S -> alpha<omega]}.
  Hence, it seems to me we should try L_{infty,aleph_epsilon}(d.q.)
(essentially, in C we can quantify over sets which are included in the
algebraic closure of finite sets), and Harrington accepts this interpretation.
Here the conjecture is proved for aleph_epsilon-saturated models. I.e., the
main theorem is M equiv_{L_{infty,aleph_epsilon}(d.q.)} N iff M cong N for
aleph_epsilon--saturated models of a superstable countable (first order) theory
