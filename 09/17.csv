the line of sight to QSOs promise to reveal the primordial deuterium abundance.
At present, the deuterium abundances (D/H) derived from the very few systems
observed are significantly discordant. Assuming the validity of all the data,
if this discordance does not reflect intrinsic primordial inhomogeneity, then
it must arise from processes operating after the primordial nucleosynthesis
epoch. We consider processes which might lead to significant deuterium
production/destruction, yet allow the cloud to mimick a chemically unevolved
system. These processes include, for example, anomalous/stochastic chemical
evolution and D/{$^4$He} photo-destruction. In general, we find it unlikely
that these processes could have altered significantly (D/H) in Lyman limit
clouds. We argue that chemical evolution scenarios, unless very finely tuned,
cannot account for significant local deuterium depletion since they tend to
overproduce $^{12}$C, even when allowance is made for possible outflow.
Similarly, D/{$^4$He} photo-destruction schemes engineered to locally produce
or destroy deuterium founder on the necessity of requiring an improbably large
$\gamma$-ray source density. Future observations of (D/H) in Lyman limit
systems may provide important insight into the initial conditions for the
primordial nucleosynthesis process, early chemical evolution, and the galaxy
formation process.

are determined by considering cooling of electrons through synchrotron,
bremsstrahlung, and Compton processes. We show that the spectra can be quite
accurately reproduced without detailed numerical calculations, and that there
is a strong testable correlation between the radio and X-ray fluxes from these
systems. We describe how different regions of the spectrum scale with the mass
of the accreting black hole, $M$, the accretion rate of the gas, $\dot{M}$, and
the equilibrium temperature of the electrons, $T_e$. We show that the universal
radio spectral index of 1/3 observed in most elliptical galaxies (Slee et al.
1994) is a natural consequence of self-absorbed synchrotron radiation from
these flows. We also give expressions for the total luminosity of these flows,
and the critical accretion rate, $\dot{M}_{crit}$, above which the advection
solutions cease to exist. We find that for most cases of interest the
equilibrium electron temperature is fairly insensitive to $M$, $\dot{M}$, and
parameters in the model. We apply these results to low luminosity black holes
in galactic nuclei. We show that the problem posed by Fabian & Canizares (1988)
of whether bright elliptical galaxies host dead quasars is resolved, as pointed
out recently by Fabian & Rees (1995), by considering advection-dominated flows.

or in extragalactic space. Cosmic rays come as protons, electrons, heavier
nuclei, and their antiparticles. Up to energies up to some tens of TeV of
particle energy it is possible to derive chemical abundances of cosmic rays. It
has been proposed that cosmic ray particles can be attributed to three main
sites of origin and acceleration, a) supernova shocks in the interstellar
medium, b) supernova shocks in a stellar wind of the predecessor star, and c)
powerful radio galaxies. This proposal leads to quantitative tests, which are
encouraging sofar. Quantitative models for transport and interaction appear to
be consistent with the data. Li, Be, B are secondary in cosmic rays, as are
many of the odd-Z elements, as well as the sub-Fe elements. At very low
energies, cosmic ray particles are subject to ionization losses, which produce
a steep low energy cutoff; all particles below the cutoff are moved into the
thermal material population, and the particles above it remain as cosmic rays.
This then changes the chemical abundances in the interstellar medium, and is a
dominant process for many isotopes of Li, Be, B. With a quantitative theory for
the origin of cosmic rays proposed, it appears worthwhile to search for yet
better spallation cross sections, especially near threshold. With such an
improved set of cross sections, the theory of the interstellar medium and its
chemical abundances, both in thermal and in energetic particles, could be taken
a large step forward.

each other in a systematic way, similar to the Levy stable distribution
proposed by Mandelbrot to describe real market indices. In the simplest, least
realistic case, exact results for the statistics of the variations are derived
by mapping onto a model of diffusing and annihilating particles, which has been
solved by quantum field theory methods. When the agents imitate each other and
respond to recent market volatility, different scaling behavior is obtained. In
this case the statistics of price variations is consistent with empirical
observations. The interplay between ``rational'' traders whose behavior is
derived from fundamental analysis of the stock, including dividends, and
``noise traders'', whose behavior is governed solely by studying the market
dynamics, is investigated. When the relative number of rational traders is
small, ``bubbles'' often occur, where the market price moves outside the range
justified by fundamental market analysis. When the number of rational traders
is larger, the market price is generally locked within the price range they
define.

general one for various type of extensions of Lagrange and Finsler geometry and
higher dimension (Kaluza--Klein type) spaces. The problem of definition of
spinors on generalized Finsler spaces is solved in the framework of the
geometry of Clifford bundles provided with compatible nonlinear and
distinguished connections and metric structures. We construct the spinor
differential geometry of locally anisotropic spaces and discuss some related
issues connected with the geometric aspects of locally anisotropc interactions
for gravitational, gauge, spinor, Dirac spinor and Proca fields. Motion
equations in generalized Finsler spaces, of the mentioned type of fields, are
defined in a geometric manner by using bundles of linear and affine frames
locally adapted to the nonlinear connection structure. The nearly autoparallel
maps are introduced as maps with deformation of connections extending the class
of geodesic and conformal transforms. Using this approach we propose two
variants of solution of the problem of definition of conservation laws on
locally anisotropic spaces.

$\phi^4$-model contains generically two types of large logarithms. To resum
those systematically a new minimal two-scale subtraction scheme $\tMS$ is
introduced in an $O(N)$-invariant generalization of $\MS$. As the $\tMS$ beta
functions depend on the renormalization scale-ratio a large logarithms
resummation is performed on them. Two partial $\tMS$ renormalization group
equations are derived to turn the beta functions into $\tMS$ running
parameters. With the use of standard perturbative boundary conditions, which
become applicable in $\tMS$, the leading logarithmic $\tMS$ effective potential
is computed. The calculation indicates that there is no stable vacuum in the
broken phase of the theory for $1<N\leq 4$.

conformal type of a Carnot--Carath\'eodory space (parabolic or hyperbolic).
Geometric criteria of conformal type are presented. They are closely related to
the asymptotic geometry of the space at infinity and expressed in terms of the
isoperimetric function and the growth of the area of geodesic spheres. In
particular, it is proved that a sub-Riemannian manifold admits a conformal
change of metric that makes it into a complete manifold of finite volume if and
only if the manifold is of conformally parabolic type. Further applications are
discussed, such as the relation between local and global invertibility
properties of quasiconformal immersions (the global homeomorphism theorem).
