singularities along smaller sub Grassmannians, using Harvey and Moore's
extension of the Howe (or theta) correspondence to modular forms with poles at
cusps. Some of the applications are as follows. We construct families of
holomorphic automorphic forms which can be written as infinite products, which
give many new examples of generalized Kac-Moody superalgebras. We extend the
Shimura and Maass-Gritsenko correspondences to modular forms with
singularities. We prove some congruences satisfied by the theta functions of
positive definite lattices, and find a sufficient condition for a Lorentzian
lattice to have a reflection group with a finite volume fundamental domain. We
give some examples suggesting that these automorphic forms with singularities
are related to Donaldson polynomials and to mirror symmetry for K3 surfaces.

theoretical predictions are found to be in good agreement with the observed

starburst regions. If the starburst regions are formed in relatively
instantaneous bursts we argue that, given their young age as derived from

galaxies massive close binaries have not contributed significantly to the WR
population, and (2) nebular HeII 4686 emission is very unlikely due to massive

The greedy nature of the algorithm makes it independent of memory resources.
Unlike other bitext mapping algorithms, SIMR allows crossing correspondences to
account for word order differences. Its output can be converted quickly and
easily into a sentence alignment. SIMR's output has been used to align over 200

$G_{diam}(x)$, which measures the distribution of the diameter of

exponentially for large diameter $x$, $G_{diam} \propto \exp(-x/\xi)$, where
$\xi$ is the correlation length as usually defined through the large-distance
behavior of two-point correlation functions. The results of our extensive Monte
Carlo study in the disordered phase of the models with $q=10$, 15, and $20$ on
large square lattices of size $300 \times 300$, $120 \times 120$, and $80

Moreover, using this observable we are able to verify an exact formula for the
correlation length $\xi_d(\beta_t)$ in the disordered phase at the first-order
transition point $\beta_t$ with an accuracy of about $1%-2%$ for all considered
values of $q$. This is a considerable improvement over estimates derived from
the large-distance behavior of standard (projected) two-point correlation
functions, which are also discussed for comparison.
