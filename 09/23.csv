over the entire sky caused by the gravitational lensing which is the result of
large scale inhomogeneities in our universe. We present a tensor spherical
harmonic formalism to describe this pattern, giving many useful formulae. This
is applied to density inhomogeneities, where we compute the angular power
spectrum of the shear pattern, as well as the noise properties due to finite
galaxy sampling and cosmic variance. We show that a detectable level of shear
is present for very nearby galaxies, $z\simlt0.2$. For such a shallow sample
much of the largest signal-to-noise comes from very large angular scales,
$\theta\simgt10^\circ$, although it is in the form of very small shear at a
level $\simlt10^{-3}$.

this tensor is clearly suited to the study of gravitational dynamics and,
moreover, that knowing its evolution is enough to completely describe a fluid

the velocity divergence and of the shear and is exact in the case of planar,
cylindrical and spherical collapses. It also reproduces very accurately the
evolution of all dynamical quantities for a very wide class of initial
conditions as illustrated by a detailed comparison with the homogeneous

  postscript figures included",,,,"cmp-lg cs.CL",,"  Most existing natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs) were designed
to be used with ``snapshot'' database systems, that provide very limited
facilities for manipulating time-dependent data. Consequently, most NLIDBs also
provide very limited support for the notion of time. The database community is
becoming increasingly interested in _temporal_ database systems. These are
intended to store and manipulate in a principled manner information not only
about the present, but also about the past and future.
  This thesis develops a principled framework for constructing English NLIDBs
for _temporal_ databases (NLITDBs), drawing on research in tense and aspect
theories, temporal logics, and temporal databases. I first explore temporal
linguistic phenomena that are likely to appear in English questions to NLITDBs.
Drawing on existing linguistic theories of time, I formulate an account for a
large number of these phenomena that is simple enough to be embodied in
practical NLITDBs. Exploiting ideas from temporal logics, I then define a
temporal meaning representation language, TOP, and I show how the HPSG grammar
theory can be modified to incorporate the tense and aspect account of this
thesis, and to map a wide range of English questions involving time to
appropriate TOP expressions. Finally, I present and prove the correctness of a
method to translate from TOP to TSQL2, TSQL2 being a temporal extension of the
SQL-92 database language. This way, I establish a sound route from English
questions involving time to a general-purpose temporal database language, that
can act as a principled framework for building NLITDBs. To demonstrate that
this framework is workable, I employ it to develop a prototype NLITDB,
implemented using ALE and Prolog.

and the cmb anisotropy, its spectral index $n$ will be measured in the
forseeable future with an accuracy $\Delta n\sim .01$. This is precisely the
kind of accuracy required to distinguish between many models of inflation. Most
of them have an inflationary potential $V\simeq V_0(1\pm\mu\phi^p)$ with the
constant term dominating. Except for $0\lsim p\lsim 2$, the prediction is
$n=1\pm (2/N)(p-1)/(p-2)$, where $N$ is the number of $e$-folds of inflation
after cosmological scales leave the horizon. It typically lies in the range
$0.9\lsim n\lsim 1.1$. For $p=2$ one has $n=1\pm 2\Mpl^2 \mu$ where $\Mpl=(8\pi
G)^{-1/2}$. A generic supergravity theory gives contributions of order $\pm
H^2$ to the inflaton mass-squared $m^2$ whereas inflation requires $|m^2| <<
H^2$. Proposals for keeping $m^2$ small are surveyed with emphasis on their
implications for $n$. Finally, the case of a multi-component inflaton (as in
`double' inflation) is discussed. In all cases, the best method of calculating
the spectrum of the adiabatic density perturbation starts with the assumption
that, after smoothing on a super-horizon scale, the evolution of the universe
along each comoving worldline will be practically the same as in an unperturbed
universe with the same initial inflaton field. The possible isocurvature
density perturbation is briefly discussed, with a simple derivation of the fact
that the low multipoles of the cmb anisotropy are six times as big as for an
adiabatic density perturbation.

  A class of models called, ``String-flip potential models,'' (SFP's) are
studied as a possible candidate for modeling nuclear matter in terms of
constituent quarks. These models are inspired from lattice
quantum-chromodynamics (QCD) and are nonperturbative in nature. It is shown
that they are viable candidates for modeling nuclear matter since they
reproduce most of the bulk properties except for nuclear binding. Their
properties are studied in nuclear and mesonic matter. A new class of models is
developed, called ``flux-bubble potential models,'' which allows for the SFP's
to be extended to include perturbative QCD interactions. Attempts to obtain
nuclear binding is not successful, but valuable insight was gained towards
possible future directions to pursue.

sum rules are identified which can be tested at future colliders. Some of these

allow gauge-mediation to be distinguished from other schemes for tansmitting

messenger representations and additional contributions to Higgs sector masses,

the invariant property of the Chern-Simons theory of quantum Hall effect and
showed that it should be equivalent to the quantum cohomology which arose as
the invariant property of topological sigma models. This isomorphism should be
related with an equivalence between the supersymmetric- and quantization
structures in two dimensional models and/or with an equivalence between
topological sigma models and the Chern-Simons theory by the methode of master
equation.

quasi-isometrically embedded condition. Let $v$ be a vertex of $T$. Let
$({X_v},d_v)$ denote the hyperbolic metric space corresponding to $v$. Then $i
: X_v \rightarrow X$ extends continuously to a map $\hat{i} : \widehat{X_v}
\rightarrow \widehat{X}$. This generalizes a Theorem of Cannon and Thurston.
The techniques are used to give a new proof of a result of Minsky: Thurston's
ending lamination conjecture for certain Kleinian groups. Applications to
graphs of hyperbolic groups and local connectivity of limit sets of Kleinian
groups are also given.

collisions from 0.8 to 1.8 GeV/u, the $K^-$ yield is underestimated by a factor
of 5--7 at 1.66 and 1.85 GeV/u. However, introducing density dependent antikaon
masses as proposed by Kaplan and Nelson, the antikaon spectra can be reasonably
well described.
