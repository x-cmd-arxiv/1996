the interactions are supposed to occur randomly at a low rate. Extinctions of

pinned in a fitness variable, and natural selection arises from the dynamics.

extensions of those in Shu's (1977) standard model for accretion in
self-gravitating isothermal spheres: a collapse front moves outwards into a
cloud at rest, and the gas behind it falls back to a collapsed core, or
protostar. The infalling material eventually enters free-fall, so that, at
small radii, the density profiles and velocity fields have the same power-law
forms in logotropic and isothermal spheres both. However, the accretion rate
onto a protostar is not constant in a logotrope, but grows in proportion to t^3
during the expansion wave. Thus, low-mass stars are accreted over longer times,
and high-mass stars over shorter times, than expected in isothermal clouds.
This result has implications for the form and origin of the stellar IMF. We
also find that infall velocities grow more slowly with time in a collapsing
logotrope. These results lead to older inferred collapse ages for Class 0
protostars in general, and for the Bok globule B335 in particular.

based on a recently introduced cumulant approach to ground--state properties of

spin--wave dispersion relations by considering hole or spin excitations of the
ground state. Usually, these dispersions are found from time--dependent
correlation functions. To demonstrate the ability of the approach we first
derive the dispersion relation for the lowest single hole excitation at
half--filling. However, the main purpose of this paper is to focus on the
mutual influence of mobile holes and spin waves in the weakly doped system. It
is shown that low-energy spin excitations strongly admix to the ground--state.
The coupling of spin waves and holes leads to a strong suppression of the
staggered magnetization which can not be explained by a simple rigid--band
picture for the hole quasiparticles. Also the experimentally observed doping
dependence of the spin--wave excitation energies can be understood within our
formalism.

from the well-measured quantity epsilon_K characterizing the CP-violation in
|Delta S|=2 transitions. The phenomenological analysis requires the input of
four key quantities: The magnitudes of the CKM elements V_cb and V_ub, the top
quark mass and the non-perturbative parameter B_K. In the recent years all of
them have been determined with increasing precision. In order to keep up with
this progress the |Delta S|=2-hamiltonian had to be obtained in the
next-to-leading order (NLO) of renormalization group improved perturbation
theory. I present the NLO results for the QCD coefficients eta_1 and eta_3,
which have been calculated by Stefan Herrlich and myself, and briefly sketch
some aspects of the calculation. Then I give an update of the Unitarity
Triangle using the summer 1996 data for the input parameters. The results for
the improved Wolfenstein parameters rho-bar and eta-bar and the CKM phase delta
are -0.21 < rho-bar < 0.22, 0.27 < eta-bar < 0.43 and 57 degrees < delta < 122
degrees. The range for the quantity sin(2 beta) entering CP asymmetries in
B-decays is found as 0.46 < sin(2 beta) < 0.79. The given ranges correspond to
one standard deviation in the input parameters. Finally I briefly discuss the
K_L-K_S mass difference.

problems about quantum theory. It is disconnected and satifies specific
separation axioms. The degree of disconnectedness of the time-space is a
decreasing function of the number of simultaneous or almost simultaneous
fundamental interactions. In this topology the U+R Penrose dynamics is
implemented by means of a time evolution operator in QFT. This operator is
unitary or non-unitary, depending on the type of quantization of the field
action-integral. The time evolution operator allows to find the Boltzmann
factor in QFT in the above space-time. From an elementary solution of the
Liouville equation the quantization of the time follows and the Planck constant
has been calculated. Compatibility between time-reversal and irreversibility is
spontaneously obtained. The renormalization of the field action-integral
follows from quantization. The solution of the measurement problem and the wave
function reduction have been deduced in the framework of the Schroedinger
theory. The Schroedinger cat's paradoxon and the paradoxon of the wave packet
decay have been resolved.

saturation density is studied within the correlated basis function perturbation
theory for momentum transfers q from 300 to 550 MeV/c. The correlation operator
includes a Jastrow component, accounting for the short range repulsion, as well
as longer range spin, tensor and isospin ones. The Schiavilla-
Pandharipande-Riska model for the two-body electromagnetic currents, satisfying
the continuity equation with realistic v_14 potentials, is adopted. Currents
due to intermediate Delta-isobar excitations, are also included. The global
contribution of the two-body currents turns out to be positive and provides an
enhancement of the one-body transverse response ranging from about 20% for the
lower momenta to about 10% for the higher ones. This finding is in agreement
with the Green's Function Monte Carlo studies of the transverse Euclidean
response in A=3,4 nuclei and contradicts previous results obtained within the
Fermi gas and shell models. The tensor-isospin component of the correlation is
found to be the leading responsible for such a behavior. The nuclear matter
response is compared to recent experimental data on 40Ca and 56Fe.
