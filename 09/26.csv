independent of the type of interaction or the central concentration of the
progenitor stars.
  We have also modelled the subsequent evolution of the hydrostatic remnants,
including mass loss and energy input from the hydrodynamical interaction. The
combination of the hydrodynamical and hydrostatic models enables us to predict
that little mixing will occur during the merger of two globular cluster stars
of equal mass. In contrast to the results of Proctor Sills, Bailyn, & Demarque
(1995), we find that neither completely mixed nor unmixed models can match the
absolute colors of observed blue stragglers in NGC 6397 at all luminosity
levels. We also find that the color distribution is probably the crucial test
for explanations of BSS formation - if stellar collisions or mergers are the
correct mechanisms, a large fraction of the lifetime of the straggler must be
spent away from the main sequence. This constraint appears to rule out the
possibility of completely mixed models. For NGC 6397, unmixed models predict
blue straggler lifetimes ranging from about 0.1 to 4 Gyr, while completely
mixed models predict a range from about 0.6 to 4 Gyr.

sources of uncertainty, we find a lower limit of M/L_V= 5.3, which is larger
than the M/L$_V$ found from rotation curve analyses inside 180$^{''}$. We thus
conclude that the mass-to-light ratio increases with radius, or in other words
that M104 possesses a dark matter halo. There is a marginal detection of
rotation in the M104 cluster system at the 92.5% confidence level; larger

when the supernova was about a week before and 4 weeks after optical maximum,
respectively. The Stokes parameters derived from the broad-band polarimetry are
consistent with zero polarization. The spectropolarimetry, however, shows broad
spectral features which are due intrinsically to an asymmetric SN atmosphere.
The spectral features in the flux spectrum and the polarization spectrum show
correlations in the wavelength range from 4900 AA up to 5500 AA. The degree of
this intrinsic component is low (<0.3 %). Theoretical polarization spectra have
been calculated. It is shown that the polarization spectra are governed by line
blending. Consequently, for similar geometrical distortions, the residual
polarization is smaller by about a factor of 2 to 3 compared to the less
blended Type II atmosphere, making it intrinsically harder to detect
asphericities in SNIa. Comparison with theoretical model polarization spectra
shows a resemblance to the observations. Taken literally, this implies an
asphericity of about 11 % in the chemical distribution in the region of partial
burning. This may not imperil the use of Type Ia supernovae as standard candles
for distance determination, but nontheless poses a source of uncertainty. SN
1996X is the first Type Ia supernova for which spectropolarimetry revealed a
polarized component intrinsic to the supernova and the first Type Ia with

curvature, planarity, and torsion. Filament statistics are applied to CDM and
CHDM ($\Omega_\nu = 0.3$) simulations of Klypin \etal (1996), the CfA1-like
mock redshift catalogs of Nolthenius, Klypin and Primack (1994, 1996), and the

Babul \& Starkman (1992), Luo \& Vishniac (1995), and Robinson \& Albrecht

power versus filament statistics. For 100 Mpc periodic simulation boxes ($H_0 =

$\sigma$ represents resampling errors) between CHDM and CDM for selected
filament statistics and shape statistics, including variations in the galaxy
identification scheme. Comparing the CfA1 data versus the models does not yield
a conclusively favored model; no model is excluded at more than a $\sim
2\sigma$ level for any statistic, not including cosmic variance which could
further degrade the discriminatory power. We find that CfA1 discriminates
between models poorly mainly due to its sparseness and small number of
galaxies, not due to redshift distortion, magnitude limiting, or geometrical
effects. We anticipate that the proliferation of large redshift surveys and
simulations will enable the statistics presented here to provide robust
discrimination between large-scale structure in various cosmological models.

Systems of N= 32 to 128 oscillators appear to be large enough to suggest
statistical mechanical behavior. A key element has been a comparison of the
maximum Lyapounov coefficient $\lambda_{max}$ of the FPU $\alpha$-model and
that of the Toda lattice. For generic initial conditions, $\lambda_{max}(t)$ is
indistinguishable for the two models up to times that increase with decreasing
energy (at fixed N). Then suddenly a bifurcation appears, which can be
discussed in relation to the breakup of regular, soliton-like structures. After
this bifurcation, the $\lambda_{max}$ of the FPU model appears to approach a
constant, while the $\lambda_{max}$ of the Toda lattice appears to approach
zero, consistent with its integrability. This suggests that for generic initial
conditions the FPU $\alpha$-model is chaotic and will therefore approach
equilibrium and equipartition of energy. There is, however, a threshold energy
density $\epsilon_c(N)\sim 1/N^2$, below which trapping occurs; here the
dynamics appears to be regular, soliton-like and the approach to equilibrium -
if any - takes longer than observable on any available computer. Above this
threshold the system appears to behave in accordance with statistical
mechanics, exhibiting an approach to equilibrium in physically reasonable
times. The initial conditions chosen by Fermi, Pasta and Ulam were not generic
and below threshold and would have required possibly an infinite time to reach
equilibrium.

strong dephasing if the coupling of the quantum dot to the electron reservoirs
is via ballistic single-mode point contacts, but becomes Gaussian if the
coupling is via tunneling contacts.

effects are treated exactly in the direction normal to the surface, and within
a quasiharmonic approximation in the plane of the surface. We apply this model
to the Ag(111) and Al(111) surfaces, and find that our calculations reproduce
the experimental observation of a large and anomalous increase in the surface
thermal expansion of Ag(111) at high temperatures [P. Statiris, H.C. Lu and T.
Gustafsson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 3574 (1994)]. Surprisingly, we find that this
increase can be attributed to a rapid softening of the in-plane phonon
frequencies, rather than due to the anharmonicity of the out-of-plane surface
phonon modes. This provides evidence for a new mechanism for the enhancement of
surface anharmonicity. A comparison with Al(111) shows that the two surfaces
behave quite differently, with no evidence for such anomalous behavior on
Al(111).

reconstruction behavior of the Li adsorbate ab initio DFT calculations have
been performed on Cu(100)+Ad, Ad = Li, Na, K systems at coverages
Theta_Ad=0.25-0.5 with and without reconstruction. The calculations show that
the (2x1) MR reconstructed surface lies energetically above the ideal (1x1)
surface by 0.2 eV per unit cell. However, alkali binding is stronger in the MR
geometry as compared to that of the ideal surface where the increase in bond
strength becomes smaller in going from Li to Na to K. As a result, the MR
reconstructed and the overlayer adsorbate systems are energetically very close
for Cu(100)+Li while for Na and K the overlayer geometry is always favored.

compressibility, entropy, and excitation energy as a function of temperature
and density. These expressions encompass the fermionic aspect of nucleons, such
as degeneracy pressure and Fermi energy at low temperatures and the ideal gas
laws at high temperatures and low density. Expressions are developed which
connect these two extremes with behavior that resembles an ideal Bose gas with
its associated Bose condensation. In the thermodynamic limit, an infinite
cluster exists below a certain critical condition in a manner similar to the
sudden appearance of the infinite cluster in percolation theory. The importance
of multiplicity fluctuations is discussed and some recent data from the EOS
