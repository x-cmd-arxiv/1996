stochastic vacuum model of Dosch and Simonov is presented in some detail. We
show how this model produces confinement. The model incorporates the idea of
the QCD vacuum acting like a dual superconductor due to an effective
chromomagnetic monopole condensate. We turn then to high energy, small momentum
transfer hadron-hadron scattering. A field-theoretic formalism to treat these
reactions is developed, where the basic quantities governing the scattering
amplitudes are correlation functions of light-like Wegner-Wilson lines and
loops. The evaluation of these correlation functions with the help of the
Minkowskian version of the stochastic vacuum model is discussed. A further
surprising manifestation of the nontrivial vacuum structure in QCD may be the
production of anomalous soft photons in hadron-hadron collisions. We interpret
these photons as being due to `synchrotron radiation from the vacuum'. A
duality argument leads us from there to the expectation of anomalous pieces
proportional to $(Q^2)^{1/6}$ in the electric form factors of the nucleons for
small $Q^2$. Finally we sketch the idea that in the Drell-Yan reaction, where a
quark-antiquark pair annihilates with the production of a lepton pair, a
`chromodynamic Sokolov-Ternov effect' may be at work. This leads to a spin
correlation of the $q\bar q$ pair, observable through the angular distribution
of the lepton pair.

abelian gauge transformation laws of relativistic two-particle constraint
theory wave functions and potentials are established and weak invariance of the
corresponding wave equations shown. Because of the three-dimensional projection
operation, these transformation laws are interaction dependent. Simplifications
occur for local potentials, which result, in each formal order of perturbation
theory, from the infra-red leading effects of multiphoton exchange diagrams. In
this case, the finite gauge transformation can explicitly be represented, with
a suitable approximation and up to a multiplicative factor, by a momentum
dependent unitary operator that acts in $x$-space as a local dilatation
operator. The latter is utilized to reconstruct from the Feynman gauge the
potentials in other linear covariant gauges. The resulting effective potential
of the final Pauli-Schr\""odinger type eigenvalue equation has the gauge
invariant attractive singularity $\alpha^2/r^2$, leading to a gauge invariant
critical coupling constant $\alpha_c =1/2$.

symmetric in all quark coordinates. We present variational Monte Carlo results
for the ground-state properties of large, three-dimensional systems. A phase
transition from nuclear to quark matter is observed which is characterized by a
dramatic rearrangement of strings. We report on exact calculations of the
dynamic response of many-quark systems in one spatial dimension. At low density
and small momentum transfers the response is substantially larger than that of
a free Fermi gas of quarks; this suggests that there is a coherent response
from all the quarks inside the hadron. This coherence, however, is incomplete,
as the response is suppressed relative to that of a free Fermi gas of nucleons
due to the internal quark substructure of the hadron.
