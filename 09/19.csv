images of the highly inclined, actively star--forming SBm galaxy NGC 55,
located in the nearby Sculptor Group. Due to its proximity, NGC 55 provides a
unique opportunity to study the disk--halo interface in a late--type galaxy
with unprecedented spatial resolution. Our images reveal a spectacular variety
of ionized gas features, ranging from giant HII region complexes, to supergiant
filamentary and shell features, to patches of very faint diffuse emission. Many
of these features protrude well above the plane of the galaxy, including a very
faint fragmented shell of emission which is visible at 2.6 kpc above the disk.
We identify candidate `chimneys' extending out of the disk, which could be the
conduits into the halo for hot gas around disk star-forming regions, and could
also provide low-density paths for the passage of UV photons from the disk to
the halo. Several of the identified chimneys are `capped' with clumps of
ionized gas, one of which, located at 1.5 kpc above the disk plane, appears to
be the site of recent star formation. Emission--line ratios
([OII]/Halpha+[NII], [SII]/Halpha+[NII]) constrain the ionization mechanism of
the gas, and our images allow the first measurement of [OII]/Halpha+[NII] in
extra-planar diffuse ionized gas. The diffuse gas is characterized by
emission--line ratios which are enhanced on average by a factor of two compared
to those of bright HII regions. Each line ratio increases in value smoothly
from the cores of HII regions, through the haloes of HII regions, into the
diffuse ionized gas. Such a continuous trend is predicted by models in which
the diffuse gas is ionized by photons produced by massive stars in HII regions.

good agreement with the theoretical zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB) of
Sweigart (1996) for an assumed reddening of E(B-V) = 0.05 and a distance
modulus of 13.05. The observed HB luminosity width is in excellent agreement
with the theoretical models and supports the single star scenario for the
origin of extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars. However, only four stars can
be identified as post-EHB stars, whereas almost three times this many are
expected from the HB number counts. If this effect is not a statistical
anomaly, then some non-canonical effect may be decreasing the post-EHB
lifetime. The recent non-canonical models of Sweigart (1996), which have
helium-enriched envelopes due to mixing along the red giant branch, cannot
explain the deficit of post-EHB stars, but might be better able to explain

(ISM). We show that a non-relativistic self-gravitating gas in thermal
equilibrium with variable number of atoms or fragments is exactly equivalent to
a field theory of a single scalar field \phi({\vec x}) with exponential self
interaction.We analyze this field theory perturbatively and non-perturbatively
through the renormalization group approach.We show scaling behaviour(critical)
for a continuous range of the temperature and of the other physical parameters.
We derive in this framework the scaling relation Delta M(R) \sim R^{d_H} for
the mass on a region of size R, and Delta v \sim R^q for the velocity
dispersion where q = (d_H -1)/2. For the density-density correlations we find a
power-law behaviour for large distances \sim|{\vec r_1} -{\vec r_2}|^{2 d_H
-6}. The fractal dimension d_H turns to be related with the critical exponent
nu of the correlation length by d_H = 1/nu. The renormalization group approach
for a single component scalar field in three dimensions states that the long-
distance critical behaviour is governed by the (non-perturbative) Ising fixed
point. The corresponding values of the scaling exponents are nu = 0.631..., d_H
= 1.585... and q = 0.293.... Mean field theory yields for the scaling exponents
nu =1/2, d_H = 2 and q = 1/2. Both the Ising and the mean field values are
compatible with the present ISM observational data: 1.4 \leq d_H \leq 2, 0.3
\leq q \leq 0.6.As typical in critical phenomena, the scaling behaviour and
critical exponents of the ISM can be obtained without dwelling into the
dynamical (time-dependent) behaviour. The relevant r\^ole of self- gravity is
stressed by the authors in a Letter to Nature, September 5, 1996.

allowed in spherical inhomogeneous or standard homogeneous big bang models.
This result, which is contrary to some other recent studies, is due to both
geometry and recently revised estimates of the uncertainties in the
observationally inferred primordial light-element abundances. We also find that
inhomogeneous primordial nucleosynthesis in the cylindrical shell geometry can
lead to significant Be and B production. In particular, a primordial beryllium
abundance as high as [Be] = 12 + log(Be/H) $\approx -3$ is possible while still
satisfying all of the light-element abundance constraints.

studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations. On the basis of the universal jump
condition it is argued that there are two distinct transitions in the model,
corresponding to the loss of XY order and Z_2 order, respectively. The
Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition is analyzed by finite size scaling of the
helicity modulus at lattices of size L = 32 through 128, giving T_KT =
0.8108(1). The vorticity-vorticity correlation function is used to determine
two different characteristic lengths, the Z_2 correlation length \xi, and the
screening length \lambda, associated with the KT transition and free vortices.
The temperature dependence of \xi is examined in order to determine T_c and the
correlation length exponent, \nu. The exponent is found to be consistent with
the 2D Ising value, \nu = 1, and the obtained critical temperature is T_c =
0.8225(5). The determinations of both \xi and \nu are done carefully, first
applying the techniques to the 2D Ising model, which serves as a convenient
testing ground.

to a phonon mode increases the quasiparticle spectral weight decreases and a

pronounced. Furthermore, strong electron-phonon coupling smears the
multi-magnon resonances (``string states'') in the incoherent part of the

surface is reduced without changing the hole pocket volume, thereby providing a
numerical verification of Luttinger theorem for this strongly interacting

negligible in spite of the fact that the ratio of the phonon frequency to the

analytic, conducting string models. These more realistic models have recently
been employed by Larsen and Axenides for investigating the collapse of circular
string loops in the case for which angular momentum is absent. The present work
extends this investigation to the generic case of circular string loops for
which angular momentum is present, so that there will be a centrifugal
potential barrier. This barrier will prevent collapse unless the initial
conditions are such that the relevant current saturation limit is attained, in
which case the string description of the vortex defect will break down, so that
its subsequent fate is hard to foresee. On the other hand if saturation is
avoided one would expect that the loop will eventually radiate away its excess
energy and settle down into a vorton type equilibrium state.

to this question and these answers dominate our view of how physics is done.
Examples of questions which were originally metaphysical are the shape of the
earth, the motion of the earth, the existence of atoms, the relativity of space
and time, the uncertainty principle, the renormalization of field theory and
the existence of quarks and strings. I will explore our changing conception of

Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. In mean field approximation the NJL model can
be regarded as an extension of the Walecka mean field model to include negative
energy fermion states. While this extension is necessary to allow for a chiral
phase transition, it was found some time ago that at the same time it destroys
the wanted saturation properties of the Walecka model. We reformulate this
problem in terms of the thermodynamic potential and find that there is indeed a
connection between these two features. We show that the minimum of the
thermodynamic potential which corresponds to stable nuclear matter in the
Walecka model is shifted from a finite to zero effective fermion mass in the
chiral NJL model. This shift is closely related to the chiral phase transition.
Under certain conditions the shifted minima may still lead to stable matter
solutions but only in the chirally restored phase. We discuss a possible
interpretation of these solutions as a schematic bag model description.

  Hirota, A.S. Holevo, and C.M. Caves (Plenum, 1997) pp.171-179",,,"quant-ph",,"  A quantum codeword is a redundant representation of a logical qubit by means
of several physical qubits. It is constructed in such a way that if one of the
physical qubits is perturbed, for example if it gets entangled with an unknown
environment, there still is enough information encoded in the other physical
qubits to restore the logical qubit, and disentangle it from the environment.
The recovery procedure may consist of the detection of an error syndrome,
followed by the correction of the error, as in the classical case. However, it
can also be performed by means of unitary operations, without having to know
the error syndrome. Since quantum codewords span only a restricted subspace of
the complete physical Hilbert space, the unitary operations that generate
quantum dynamics (that is, the computational process) are subject to
considerable arbitrariness, similar to the gauge freedom in quantum field
theory. Quantum codewords can thus serve as a toy model for investigating the
quantization of constrained dynamical systems.

separability is derived and is shown to be more sensitive than Bell's
inequality for detecting quantum inseparability. Moreover, collective tests of
Bell's inequality (namely, tests that involve several composite systems
