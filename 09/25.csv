forces external to the gas in the BLR clouds, such as tidal disruption, or

galaxies indicate the presence of a large column of ``cold'' absorbing gas. The
physical nature of the absorbing medium remains a mystery. Searches for H I
absorption using the 21 cm hyperfine structure line yielded null results in
most cases. The purpose of this contribution is to point out that the Lyman
$\alpha$ absorption cross section is ~10^7 times larger than for the 21 cm
line, it can therefore be used as a very sensitive probe of the H I column in
clusters, and can thus place stringent constraints on the nature of the X-ray
absorber. This method is applied to the Perseus CF cluster where a medium
resolution (~250 km/s) UV spectrum is available. The upper limit on the H I
column obtained using Lyman $\alpha$ is at least ~50 times smaller than the 21
cm detection, and ~5,000 smaller than implied by X-ray spectra, indicating that
the X-ray absorber is exceedingly devoid of H I. Higher resolution UV spectra
with HST may improve the H I column limits by an additional factor of ~4,000.
This method can be applied to strongly constrain the nature of the X-ray
absorbing medium in a significant fraction of CF clusters .

foreground absorption by cold gas in 22 of the 23 quasars. 2. The mean 0.2-2
keV continuum of quasars agrees remarkably well with an extrapolation of the
mean 1050-350A continuum recently determined by Zheng et al. (1996), indicating
that there is no steep soft component below 0.2 keV. 3. The occurrence of warm
absorbers in quasars is rather rare, in sharp contrast to lower luminosity AGN.
4. The strongest correlation found is between the spectral slope, alpha_x, and
the Hb FWHM. This remarkably strong correlation may result from a dependence of
alpha_x on L/L_Edd, as seen in Galactic black hole candidates. 5. There appears
to exist a distinct class of ``X-ray weak'' quasars. These may be quasars where
the direct X-ray source is obscured, and only scattered X-rays are observed. 6.
Thin accretion disk models cannot reproduce the observed optical to soft X-ray
spectral shape. An as yet unknown physical mechanism maintains a strong
correlation between the optical and soft X-ray emission. 7. The well known
difference in alpha_x between radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars may be due
only to their different Hb FWHM. 8. The agreement of the 21 cm and X-ray
columns implies that He in the diffuse H II component of the Galactic ISM is
ionized to He II or He III (shortened abstract).

neither of these two methods is apropriate to identify a large number of

Magnetic-type parity combination does not receieve contributions from scalar

parity combination, so there are four different power spectra that fully
characterize statistical properties of CMB. We present their explicit
expressions for scalar and tensor modes in the form of line of sight integral
solution and numerically evaluate them for a representative set of models.
These general solutions differ from the expressions obtained previously in the
small scale limit both for scalar and tensor modes. A method to generate and

spectrum including a large peak around the HI ionization energy due to decaying

relatively small observed ratio of neutral He and H densities in Lyman-limit
systems if their size is of the kpc order. The recently proposed decrease of
the contribution from unstable neutrinos solves this problem but tends to spoil
the consistence between IGM and Lyman-$\alpha$ clouds, which requires a large
ratio of fluxes for the HI and HeII ionization frequencies, unless there is a
very fast decline of quasars above $z = 3$. On the other hand, the addition of
stars to quasars may produce a spectrum sufficiently hard between HI and HeI
and thereafter soft up to HeII to allow a reasonable agreement of the
properties of denser absorbers with those of IGM. This model seems to favour
cold dark matter with additional cosmological constant.

discourse process called {\sc centering}, (2) to apply this account to
discourse processing in Japanese so that it can be used in computational
systems for machine translation or language understanding, and (3) to provide
some insights on the effect of syntactic factors in Japanese on discourse
interpretation. We argue that while discourse interpretation is an inferential
process, syntactic cues constrain this process, and demonstrate this argument
with respect to the interpretation of {\sc zeros}, unexpressed arguments of the
verb, in Japanese. The syntactic cues in Japanese discourse that we investigate
are the morphological markers for grammatical {\sc topic}, the postposition
{\it wa}, as well as those for grammatical functions such as {\sc subject},
{\em ga}, {\sc object}, {\em o} and {\sc object2}, {\em ni}. In addition, we
investigate the role of speaker's {\sc empathy}, which is the viewpoint from
which an event is described. This is syntactically indicated through the use of
verbal compounding, i.e. the auxiliary use of verbs such as {\it kureta, kita}.
Our results are based on a survey of native speakers of their interpretation of
short discourses, consisting of minimal pairs, varied by one of the above
factors. We demonstrate that these syntactic cues do indeed affect the
interpretation of {\sc zeros}, but that having previously been the {\sc topic}
and being realized as a {\sc zero} also contributes to the salience of a
discourse entity. We propose a discourse rule of {\sc zero topic assignment},
and show that {\sc centering} provides constraints on when a {\sc zero} can be
interpreted as the {\sc zero topic}.

this potentially undesirable conversational strategy often occurs in the course
of naturally-occurring discourse. In this chapter, I report on an empirical
study of 250 utterances with {\it zeros} in 20 Japanese newspaper articles.
Each utterance is analyzed in terms of centering transitions and the form in
which centers are realized by referring expressions. I also examine lexical
subcategorization information, and tense and aspect in order to test the
hypothesis that the speaker expects the hearer to use this information in
determining global discourse structure. I explain the occurrence of {\it zeros}
in {\sc retain} and {\sc rough-shift} centering transitions, by claiming that a
{\it zero} can only be used in these cases when the shift of centers is
supported by contextual information such as lexical semantics, tense and
aspect, and agreement features. I then propose an algorithm by which centering
can incorporate these observations to integrate centering with global discourse
structure, and thus enhance its ability for non-local pronoun resolution.

specifying an architecture for natural language analysis in which probabilities

elements; and (ii) it explores the development of a mathematical theory to
predict the expected accuracy of statistical language learning systems in terms
of the volume of data used to train them.
  The theoretical work is illustrated by applying statistical language learning
designs to the analysis of noun compounds. Both syntactic and semantic analysis
of noun compounds are attempted using the proposed architecture. Empirical
comparisons demonstrate that the proposed syntactic model is significantly

all candidate gauge anomalies, and of the possible nontrivial (continuous)

is proved that in old minimal supergravity the most general gauge invariant
action can indeed be constructed from well-known superspace integrals, whereas
in new minimal supergravity there are only a few additional (but important)
contributions which cannot be constructed in this way without further ado.
Furthermore the results indicate that supersymmetry itself is not anomalous in
minimal supergravity and show that the gauge transformations are extremely
stable under consistent deformations of the models. There is however an unusual
deformation converting new into old minimal supergravity with local
R-invariance which is reminiscent of a duality transformation.

nuclear collisions is studied. The pre-equilibrium contribution to open charm
production in $A+A$ collisions at $\sqrt s=200 AGeV$ is shown to be very
sensitive to correlations between momenta and space-time coordinates of the
minijets produced after the initial collision. A minimal correlation model
based on the uncertainty principle is introduced, and leads only to a small
pre-equilibrium charm yield as compared with initial yields. Opposite-sign
lepton pairs $ee, e\mu$ and $\mu\mu$ from open charm decay in $p+A$ reactions
at $\sqrt s=200$ AGeV are proposed as a measure of nuclear shadowing effects.
Via an approximate scaling, the ratio of the spectra from $p+A$ collisions to
those from $pp$ collisions is shown to reflect the shadowing function well.
Finally it is shown that the required measurements are feasible at RHIC.

  Fronts","27 pages, Latex, 2 figures",,"10.1016/S0167-2789(97)82005-2",,"patt-sol nlin.PS",,"  We consider a diffusive Coupled Map Lattice (CML) for which the local map is
piece-wise affine and has two stable fixed points. By introducing a
spatio-temporal coding, we prove the one-to-one correspondence between the set
of global orbits and the set of admissible codes. This relationship is applied
to the study of the (uniform) fronts' dynamics. It is shown that, for any given
velocity in $[-1,1]$, there is a parameter set for which the fronts with that
velocity exist and their shape is unique. The dependence of the velocity of the
fronts on the local map's discontinuity is proved to be a Devil's staircase.
Moreover, the linear stability of the global orbits which do not reach the
discontinuity follows directly from our simple map. For the fronts, this
statement is improved and as a consequence, the velocity of all the propagating
interfaces is computed for any parameter. The fronts are shown to be also
nonlinearly stable under some restrictions on the parameters. Actually, these
restrictions follow from the co-existence of uniform fronts and non-uniformly
travelling fronts for strong coupling. Finally, these results are extended to
some $C^{\infty}$ local maps.

constructed, by starting from the Gor'kov equation with including correction
terms up to the next order of ln(T_c/T). Some of the non-local correction terms
are found to break the cylindrical symmetry and lead to the fourfold symmetric
core structure, reflecting the internal degree of freedom in the pair
potential. Using this extended Ginzburg Landau theory, we investigate the
fourfold symmetric structure of the pair potential, current and magnetic field
around an isolated single vortex, and clarify concretely how the vortex core
