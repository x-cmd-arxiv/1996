to map the distribution of mass at large radii from the cluster center. The

In this paper, we present two methods to infer the possible existence and
extent of dark halos around bright cluster galaxies by quantifying the `local'
weak lensing induced by them. The proposed methods are: direct radial averaging
of the shear field in the vicinity of bright cluster members and a
maximum-likelihood method to extract fiducial parameters characterizing galaxy
halos. We demonstrate using simulations that these observed local weak-shear
effects on galaxy scales within the cluster can be used to statistically
constrain the mean mass-to-light ratio, and fiducial parameters like the halo
size, velocity dispersion and hence mass of cluster galaxies. We compare the
two methods and investigate their relative drawbacks and merits in the context
of feasibility of application to HST cluster data, whereby we find that the
prospects are promising for detection on stacking a minimum of 20 WFPC2 deep

We argue that only those operators formed of fields which have vacuum
expectation values are dangerous. Supersymmetric axion models fail to prevent
even this restricted class of operators. Furthermore, the models that relate
the PQ scale and the supersymmetry breaking scale are particularly sensitive to
gauge invariant PQ-breaking operators. By contrast, in non-supersymmetric
composite axion models the PQ scale arises naturally, and the dangerous
operators can be avoided. However, the composite axion models contain heavy
stable particles which are cosmologically ruled out. Another problem is a
Landau pole for the QCD coupling constant. Both these problems may be solved if
the unification of color with the gauge interactions which bind the axion could
be achieved.

interest, especially in cases where the measured spectra do not allow to
ascertain the underlying reaction mechanism. In recent times it became popular
to believe that the comparison of Hanbury-Brown Twiss correlation functions
obtained from classical or semiclassical transport theories, like Boltzmann
Uehling Uhlenbeck (BUU), Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD), VENUS, RQMD or ARC,
with experiments may provide this insight. It is the purpose of this article to
show that this conjecture encounters serious problems. The models which are
suited to be compared with the experiments at CERN and Brookhaven are not able
to predict a correlation function. Any agreement with existing data has to be
considered as accidental. The models suited for lower energies can in principle
predict correlation functions. The systematic error may be too large to be of
use as far as quantitative conclusions are concerned.

the statistical model (Hauser-Feshbach) approach is not applicable and direct
contributions may dominate the cross sections. For neutron-rich, even-even Sn
targets, we compare the resulting neutron capture cross sections when
consistently taking the input for the direct capture calculations from three
different microscopic models. The results underline the sensitivity of cross
sections calculated in the direct model to nuclear structure models which can
lead to high uncertainties when lacking experimental information.
