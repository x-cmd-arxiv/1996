molecular clouds. A summary of the dynamical evolution of HII regions and
wind-driven bubbles in high-pressure cloud cores is given. Both ultracompact
HII regions and ultracompact wind-driven bubbles can reach pressure equilibrium
with their surrounding medium. The structures stall their expansion and become
static and, as long as the ionization sources and the ambient densities remain
about constant, the resulting regions are stable and long lived. For cases with
negative density gradients, and depending on the density distribution, some
regions never reach the static equilibrium condition. For power-law density
stratifications, $\rho \propto r^{-w}$, the properties of the evolution depend
on a critical exponent, $w_{crit}$, above which the ionization front cannot be
slowed down by recombinations or new ionizations, and the cloud becomes fully
ionized. This critical exponent is $w_{crit}=3/2$ during the expansion phase.
For $w>3/2 $ the gas expands supersonically into the surrounding ionized
medium, and there are two regimes separated by $w=3$. For $3/2<w\leq 3$, the
slow regime, the inner region drives a weak shock moving with almost constant
velocity through the cloud. For $w>3$, the fast regime, the shock becomes
strong and accelerates with time. Finally, the evolution of slow winds in

a circumbinary disc subject to the tidal-forcing of a binary with a fixed
circular orbit. We consider fluid discs with a range of thicknesses and
binaries with a range of mass ratios, orbital separations and inclination
angles. Our numerical simulations are implemented using a SPH code. For our
unperturbed disc models, we write a scaling relation for the shear viscosity
and deduce that the disc thickness cannot be varied without affecting the
viscosity in these kinds of SPH disc models. It is found that maintainance of
an inner cavity owing to the tidal truncation of the disc is effective for
non-zero orbital inclinations. Also we show that our model discs may precess
approximately like rigid bodies, provided that the disc is able to communicate
on a length scale comparable to the inner boundary radius by either sonic or
viscous effects, in a sufficiently small fraction of the local precession
period. Furthermore, the disc precession period may tend to infinity if the
disc outer edge is allowed to become arbitrarily large, the disc suffering only
a modest quasi-steady warp near the inner boundary. When the disc response is
linear, or weakly non-linear, the precession periods and the forms of warping
that we measure yield reasonable quantitative agreement with the analytical
expressions that we derive from a linear response calculation. For a stronger
disc response the results can agree poorly with our linear analysis, although
some qualitative features of the response remain intact. We show that the
response of a disc of non-interacting particles is qualitatively different from
this. The work presented in this paper is of relevance to a number of
astrophysical phenomena of current interest in star and planet formation.

assumption that they are powered by massive accreting black holes. Accretion
flows around massive black holes make a transition from high radiative
efficiency ($\sim 10%$) to low efficiency, advection-dominated flows when
${\dot M}/{\dot M}_{Edd}$ falls below the critical rate $\sim 0.3\alpha^2\sim
10^{-2}$ where ${\dot M}$ is the mass accretion rate, ${\dot M}_{Edd}\propto M$
is the usual Eddington rate with the nominal 10% efficiency, and $\alpha (\le
1)$ is the dimensionless viscosity parameter. We identify this transition with
the observed break at a redshift $\sim 2$ in the QSOs' X-ray luminosity
evolution. Growth of black holes through accretion could naturally lead to such
a transition at a critical redshift $z_c\sim 1-3$, provided that most of high
redshift QSOs appear with near Eddington luminosities at $z\sim 3-4$ and the
accretion rates decline over the Hubble time in a roughly synchronous manner.
Before the transition, the QSOs' luminosities (with a high efficiency) slowly
decrease and after the transition at $z_c$, the QSO luminosities evolve
approximately as $\propto (1+z)^{K(z)}$ where $K(z)$ gradually varies from
$z=z_c$ to $z\sim 0$ around $K\sim3$. The results depend on the details of the
QSO X-ray emission mechanism. We discuss some further implications.

action of symmetry groups. The more complicated Wigner ensemble, which does not
enjoy such symmetry properties, is studied by large $N$ renormalization

symmetrically with respect to the origin. This separation arises because the

Surprisingly, we find that in the scaling limit, P(tau,t) is identical for
these two models. We also show that the average age, i. e., the average time
since a site was last visited by an interface, grows linearly with the
observation time t. This latter property is also found in the one-dimensional
Ising model with zero temperature Glauber dynamics. We also discuss briefly the

the magnetic susceptibility of singly-connected and the persistent currents of

studying confinement by perfect (disorder free) potentials stressing the
importance of the underlying classical dynamics. We demonstrate that in a
constrained geometry the standard Landau diamagnetic response is always
present, but is dominated by finite-size corrections of a quasi-random sign
which may be orders of magnitude larger. These corrections are very sensitive
to the nature of the classical dynamics. Systems which are integrable at zero
magnetic field exhibit larger magnetic response than those which are chaotic.
This difference arises from the large oscillations of the density of states in
integrable systems due to the existence of families of periodic orbits. The
connection between quantum and classical behavior naturally arises from the use
of semiclassical expansions. This key tool becomes particularly simple and
insightful at finite temperature, where only short classical trajectories need
to be kept in the expansion. In addition to the general theory for integrable
systems, we analyze in detail a few typical examples of experimental relevance:
circles, rings and square billiards. In the latter, extensive numerical
calculations are used as a check for the success of the semiclassical analysis.
We study the weak-field regime where classical trajectories remain essentially
unaffected, the intermediate field regime where we identify new oscillations
characteristic for ballistic mesoscopic structures, and the high-field regime
where the typical de Haas-van Alphen oscillations exhibit finite-size
corrections. We address the comparison with experimental data obtained in
high-mobility semiconductor microstructures discussing the differences between
individual and ensemble measurements, and the applicability of the present
model.

known statistical properties. The power of the Derrida method is that it uses
the equilibrium probability distribution, that exists for each {\em finite}

vanishing microcurrent, our results demonstrate the equality of the
renormalization processes for the effective drift and diffusivity tensors. This
establishes, for those cases, a Ward identity previously verified only to
two-loop order in perturbation theory in certain models. The technique can be
applied also to media in which the diffusivity exhibits spatial fluctuations.

determine the 1PN relativistic corrections to the ``Newtonian"" radiation
reaction potential of Burke and Thorne. The 1PN reaction potential involves
both scalar and vectorial components, with the scalar component depending on
the mass-type quadrupole and octupole moments of the system, and the vectorial

case of binary systems, the 1PN radiation reaction potential has been shown to
yield consistent results for the 3.5PN approximation in the binary's equations

experimental information into the subthreshold region where the theory should

behaviour of chiral expansions which highlights potential differences between
the Standard and the Generalized forms of the theory. We illustrate how, with
current experimental uncertainties, data cannot distinguish between these
particular {\em discriminatory} coefficients despite their sensitivity.
Nevertheless, the Chell--Olsson test does provide a consistency check of the
chiral expansion, requiring that the ${\cal O}(p^6)$ corrections to the {\em
discriminatory} coefficients in the Standard theory must be $\sim 100%$.
Indeed, some of these have been deduced from the new ${\cal O}(p^6)$
computations and found to give such large corrections. One can then check that
the ${\cal O}(p^8)$ corrections must be much smaller. We conclude that this
test, like others, cannot distinguish between the different forms of Chiral
Symmetry Breaking embodied in the alternative versions of Chiral Perturbation
Theory without much more precise experimental information near threshold.
