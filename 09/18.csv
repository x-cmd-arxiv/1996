observations of Cepheid variable stars, we find that the absolute SBF magnitude
in the Kron-Cousins I band correlates well with the mean (V-I)o color of a

  M_Ibar = (-1.74 +/- 0.07) + (4.5 +/- 0.25) [ (V-I)o - 1.15 ]

stellar population models. Comparisons between SBF distances and a variety of
other estimators, including Cepheid variable stars, the Planetary Nebula
Luminosity Function (PNLF), Tully-Fisher (TF), Dn-sigma, SNII, and SNIa,
demonstrate that the calibration of SBF is universally valid and that SBF error
estimates are accurate. The zero point given by Cepheids, PNLF, TF (both
calibrated using Cepheids), and SNII is in units of Mpc; the zero point given
by TF (referenced to a distant frame), Dn-sigma and SNIa is in terms of a
Hubble expansion velocity expressed in km/s. Tying together these two zero
points yields a Hubble constant of H_0 = 81 +/- 6 km/s/Mpc. As part of this
analysis, we present SBF distances to 12 nearby groups of galaxies where
Cepheids, SNII, and SNIa have been observed.

properties of the Ly$\alpha$ forest in a numerical simulation of an $\Omega=1$,

most observational studies of the forest, and we compare the simulations to
recently published results derived from Keck HIRES spectra. With the
Voigt-profile decomposition analysis, the simulation reproduces the large
number of weak lines ($N_{\rm HI}\la 10^{13}\cdunits$) found in the HIRES
spectra. The column density distribution evolves significantly between $z=3$
and $z=2$, with the number of lines at fixed column density dropping by a
factor $\sim 1.6$ in the range where line blending is not severe. At $z=3$, the
$b$-parameter distribution has a median of $35 \kms$ and a dispersion of $20
\kms$, in reasonable agreement with the observed values. The comparison between
our new analysis and recent data strengthens earlier claims that the \lya
forest arises naturally in hierarchical structure formation as photoionized gas
falls into dark matter potential wells. However, there are two statistically
signficant discrepancies between the simulated forest and the HIRES results:
the model produces too many lines at $z=3$ by a factor $\sim 1.5-2$, and it
produces more narrow lines ($b<20 \kms$) than are seen in the data. The first
result is sensitive to our adopted normalization of the mean \lya optical
depth, and the second is sensitive to our assumption that helium reionization
has not significantly raised gas temperatures at $z=3$. It is therefore too
early to say whether these discrepancies indicate a fundamental problem with
the high-redshift structure of the $\Omega=1$ CDM model or reflect errors of
detail in our modeling of the gas distribution or the observational procedure.

objects reduces the number required for production as compared to short lived

largely on kinematic and time scale considerations of beaming, precession, and

predictions for both disk and elliptical galaxies and for `closed-box',
`inflow', and `outflow' models of galactic evolution. In Paper I we
investigated whether it is possible to explain the extreme dust masses of
high-redshift quasars and radio galaxies by galactic evolution. In this paper
we use the model to make predictions of the submillimetre background and source

submillimetre background recently measured by Puget et al. (1996). We also find
that it is possible to fit the background over the entire wavelength range with
a elliptical model but not with a disk model. We make source count predictions
at 190 $\mu$m for the ISOPHOT instrument on ISO and at 850 $\mu$m for SCUBA. We
show that the shape of the 850 $\mu$ m source counts depends almost entirely on
the mass spectrum of the radiating objects. Finally, we consider the
limitations of the models. We find that one of the biggest uncertainties in the

the counts and colours of galaxies at the faintest detection limits, we show
that the faint blue galaxies are likely to lie at high redshift (z approx. 2).
This conclusion holds regardless of whether the Universe is assumed to be open

with galaxy models in which star formation rates decay exponentially with
decreasing redshift, whereas the assumption of a flat universe requires the
addition of a population of galaxies which are seen only at high redshift.

Universe and measuring cosmological parameters. In this paper we present a
systematic study of the expected dependence of the low order moments of the
filtered gravitational local convergence with the power spectrum of the density
fluctuations and with the cosmological parameters Omega_0 and Lambda. The
results show a significant dependence with all these parameters. Though we note
that this degeneracy could be partially raised by considering two populations
of sources, at different redshifts, computing the third moment is more
promising since it is expected, in the quasi-linear regime and for Gaussian
initial conditions, to be only $\Omega_0$ dependent (with a slight degeneracy
with Lambda) when it is correctly expressed in terms of the second moment.
  More precisely we show that the variance of the convergence varies
approximately as P(k) Omega_0^{1.5} z_s^{1.5}, whereas the skewness varies as
Omega_0^{-0.8} z_s^{-1.35}, where P(k) is the projected power spectrum and z_s
the redshift of sources. Thus, used jointly they can provide both P(k) and
Omega_0. However, the dependence with the redshift of sources is large and
could be a major concern for a practical implementation.
  We have estimated the errors expected for these parameters in realistic
scenario and sketched what would be the observational requirements for doing
such measurements. A more detailed study of an observational strategy is left

galaxies. Their origin could be due to the winding up of a primordial
cosmological field or due to amplification of a small seed field by a turbulent
galactic dynamo. Both options have difficulties: There is no known battery
mechanism for producing the required primordial field. Equally the turbulent
dynamo may self destruct before being able to produce the large scale field,
due to excess generation of small scale power. The current status of these
difficulties is discussed. The resolution could depend on the nature of the
saturated field produced by the small scale dynamo. We argue that the small
scale fields do not fill most of the volume of the fluid and instead
concentrate into intermittent ropes, with their peak value of order
equipartition fields, and radii much smaller than their lengths. In this case
these fields neither drain significant energy from the turbulence nor convert
eddy motion of the turbulence on the outer scale to wave like motion. This
preserves the diffusive effects needed for the large scale dynamo operation.

the target periodic orbit and hence the stabilized periodic orbit is one of the
original dynamical system. Furthermore, this control method only requires the
knowledge of the period of the unstable orbit. The amount of feedback gain
needed to achieve stabilization varies with the bifurcation parameter(s) of the

collection of m sections of a real rank n vector bundle. This current is
supported on the linear dependency set of the collection of sections. It is
defined whenever the collection satisfies a weak measure theoretic condition
called ""atomicity"". Essentially any reasonable collection of sections satisfies
this condition, vastly extending the usual general position hypothesis. This
current is a mod 2, closed, locally integrally flat current of degree q= n-m+1
and hence determines a mod 2 cohomology class. This class is shown to be well
defined independent of the collection of sections. Moreover it is the q-th
Stielfel-Whitney class of the vector bundle. More is true if q is odd or q=n.
In this case a linear dependency current which is twisted by the orientation of
the bundle can be associated to the collection. The cohomology class of the
linear dependency current is 2-torsion and is the q-th twisted integral
Stiefel-Whitney class of the bundle. In addition, higher dependency and general
degeneracy currents of bundle maps are studied, together with applications to
singularities of projections and maps. These results rely on a theorem of
Federer which states that the complex of integrally flat currents mod p
computes cohomology mod p. An alternate approach to Federer's theorem is
offered in an appendix. This approach is simpler and is via sheaf theory.

regarded as a signal of monopole condensation. Second, we study instantons and

monopole dominance for instantons in the confinement phase even at finite

monopole-loop length and the integral of the absolute value of the topological

emphasis on the main mechanisms for Higgs production and decay at LEP2 and LHC,
and theoretical bounds on the Higgs boson masses. In the ``Standard Model'' the
effective potential can develop a non-standard minimum for values of the field
much larger than the weak scale. Comparison of the decay rate to the
non-standard minimum at finite (and zero) temperature with the corresponding
expansion rate of the Universe allows to identify the region, in the ($M_H$,
$M_t$)-plane which can be accomodated by the theory. In the ``Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model'', approximate analytical expressions for the
Higgs mass spectrum and couplings are worked out. An appropriate treatment of
squark decoupling allows to consider large values of the stop mixing parameters
and thus fix a reliable upper bound on the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs
boson mass. The discovery of the Higgs boson at LEP2 might put an upper bound
(below the Planck scale) on the scale of new physics $\Lambda$ and eventually
disentangle between the Standard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model.

every symmetric 2-H*-algebra is equivalent to the category Rep(G) of continuous
unitary finite-dimensional representations of some compact supergroupoid G. The
equivalence is given by a categorified version of the Gelfand transform; we
also construct a categorified version of the Fourier transform when G is a
compact abelian group. Finally, we characterize Rep(G) by its universal
properties when G is a compact classical group. For example, Rep(U(n)) is the
free connected symmetric 2-H*-algebra on one even object of dimension n.

algebra (also called loop algebra) associated with a quasitriangular Hopf
algebra H. It is shown that as an algebra it coincides with the so-called
braided group constructed by S. Majid on the dual of H. Gauge transformations
act on monodromy algebras via the coadjoint action. Applying a result of Majid,
the resulting crossed product is isomorphic to the Drinfeld double D(H). Hence,
under the so-called factorizability condition given by N. Reshetikhin and M.
Semenov-Tian- Shansky, both algebras are isomorphic to the algbraic tensor
product H\otimes H. It is indicated that in this way the results of Alekseev et
al. on lattice current algebras are consistent with the theory of more general
Hopf spin chains given by K. Szlach\'anyi and the author. In the Appendix the
multi-loop algebras L_m of Alekseev and Schomerus [AS] are identified with
braided tensor products of monodromy algebras in the sense of Majid, which
leads to an explanation of the ``bosonization formula'' of [AS] representing
L_m as H\otimes\dots\otimes H.

intersecting line nodes in the gap function is proportional to $E log (\alpha
\Delta_0 /E)$ for $|E| << \Delta_0$, where $\Delta_0$ is the maximum value of
the gap function and $\alpha$ is constant, while it is proportional to $E$ if
the line nodes do not intersect. As a result, a logarithmic correction appears
in the temperature dependence of the NMR relaxation rate and the specific heat,
which can be observed experimentally. By comparing with those for the heavy
fermion superconductors, we can obtain information about the symmetry of the
gap function.
