a dispersion of $20\kms$, in reasonable agreement with the observed values. The
comparison between our new analysis and recent data strengthens earlier claims
that the Ly$alpha$ forest arises naturally in hierarchical structure formation

analyzing the excitation of the rotational levels. Using Large Velocity

is 5.9), but much less than the critical density of the J=7-6 line. Small maps
of 25 of the sources in the J = 5-4 line yield a mean diameter of 1.0 pc. The
mean virial mass is 3800 solar masses. The mean ratio of bolometric luminosity
to virial mass (L/M) is 190, about 50 times higher than estimates using CO
emission, suggesting that star formation is much more efficient in the dense
gas probed in this study. The gas depletion time for the dense gas is roughly
1.3 x 10^7 yr. We find no statistically significant linewidth--size or
density--size relationships in our data. Instead, both linewidth and density
are larger for a given size than would be predicted by the usual relationships.
We find that the linewidth increases with density, the opposite of what would
be predicted by the usual arguments. We estimate that the luminosity of our
Galaxy (excluding the inner 400 pc) in the CS J = 5-4 transition is 15 to 23
L_sun, considerably less than the luminosity in this line within the central
100 pc of NGC 253 and M82. In addition, the ratio of far-infrared luminosity to

problem in continuum mechanics which is generally intractable except by
numerical methods. Conventional approaches break down in the limit of small
plate thickness due to appearance of discontinuities in the solution which
require boundary layer treatment. We examine a simple case of a plate bent by
forces exerted along its boundary so as to create a sharp crease in the limit
of infinitely small thickness. We find a separable boundary layer solution of
the von Karman plate equations which is valid along the ridge line. We confirm
a scaling argument (T. A. Witten and Hao Li, Europhys. Lett. 23 51 (1993)) that
asserts that the ridge possesses a characteristic radius of curvature $R$ given
by the thickness of the sheet $h$ and the length of the ridge $X$ {\it viz.} $R
\sim h^{1/3} X^{2/3}$. The elastic energy of the ridge scales as $E \sim \kappa
(X/h)^{1/3}$ where $\kappa$ is the bending modulus of the sheet. We determine
the dependence of these quantities on the dihedral angle of the ridge $\pi -
2\alpha$. For all angles $R \sim \alpha^{-4/3}$ and $E \sim \alpha^{7/3}$. The
framework developed in this paper is suitable for determination of other
properties of ridges such as their interaction or behavior under various types

simple and physically intuitive derivation of this result based on a random
walk analogy and show the following: 1) the result applies to the asymptotic
($t \to \infty$) distribution of $w_t$ and should be distinguished from the
central limit theorem which is a statement on the asymptotic distribution of
the reduced variable ${1 \over \sqrt{t}}(log w_t -< log w_t >)$; 2) the
necessary and sufficient conditions for $P(w_t)$ to be a power law are that
<log \lambda_j > < 0 (corresponding to a drift $w_t \to 0$) and that $w_t$ not
be allowed to become too small. We discuss several models, previously
unrelated, showing the common underlying mechanism for the generation of power
laws by multiplicative processes: the variable $\log w_t$ undergoes a random
walk biased to the left but is bounded by a repulsive ''force''. We give an
approximate treatment, which becomes exact for narrow or log-normal
distributions of $\lambda$, in terms of the Fokker-Planck equation. 3) For all
these models, the exponent $\mu$ is shown exactly to be the solution of
$\langle \lambda^{\mu} \rangle = 1$ and is therefore non-universal and depends
on the distribution of $\lambda$.

topcolor is further introduced, the branching ratio in the topcolor assisted
MWTCM can be in agreement with the CLEO data for a certain range of the
parameters.

the renormalized quantities of a scalar field theory. The naturalness problem
and questions related to triviality bounds are briefly discussed. We discuss
unphysical features associated with the hierarchical approximation such as the
recently observed oscillatory corrections to the scaling laws. We mention a
two-parameter family of recursion formulas which allows one to continuously
extrapolate between Wilson's approximate recursion formula and the recursion
formula of Dyson's hierarchical model. The parameters are the dimension D and
2^zeta, the number of sites integrated in one RG transformation. We show
numerically that at fixed D, the critical exponent gamma depends continuously
on zeta. We suggest the requirement of zeta -independence as a guide for
constructing improved recursion formulas.

Casimir operators of a Lie algebra with rank N. For a Casimir operator of
degree p, this will be provided by an explicit calculation of its symmetric
coefficients $ g^{A_1,A_2,.. A_p}$. It is seen that these coefficients can be
descibed by some rational polinomials of rank N. These polinomials are also
multilinear in Cartan sub-algebra indices taking values from the set $I_0 =
{1,2,.. N}$. The crucial point here is that for each degree one needs, in
general, more than one polinomials. This in fact is related with an observation
that the whole set of symmetric coefficients $ g^{A_1,A_2,.. A_p} $ is
decomposed into sum subsets which are in one to one correspondence with these
polinomials. We call these subsets clusters and introduce some indicators with
which we specify different clusters. These indicators determine all the
clusters whatever the numerical values of coefficients $g^{A_1,A_2,.. A_p}$
are. For any degree p, the number of clusters is independent of rank N. This
hence allows us to generalize our results to any value of rank N.
  To specify the general framework explicit constructions of 4th and 5th order
Casimir operators of $A_N$ Lie algebras are studied and all the polinomials
which specify the numerical value of their coefficients are given explicitly.

turbulence subject to the conservation of two infinite families of constants of
motion---the magnetic and the ""cross"" topology invariants--is examined. The
analysis of the Gibbs ensemble, where all integrals of motion are respected,
predicts the initial state to evolve into an equilibrium, stable coherent
structure (the most probable state) and decaying Gaussian turbulence
(fluctuations) with a vanishing, but always positive temperature. The
non-dissipative turbulence decay is accompanied by decrease in both the
amplitude and the length scale of the fluctuations, so that the fluctuation
energy remains finite. The coherent structure represents a set of singular
magnetic islands with plasma flow whose magnetic topology is identical to that
of the initial state, while the energy and the cross topology invariants are
shared between the coherent structure and the Gaussian turbulence. These
conservation laws suggest the variational principle of iso-topological
relaxation which allows us to predict the appearance of the final state from a
given initial state. For a generic initial condition having X points in the
magnetic field, the coherent structure has universal types of singularities:
current sheets terminating at Y points. These structures, which are similar to
those resulting from the 2D relaxation of magnetic field frozen into an ideally
conducting viscous fluid, are observed in the numerical experiment of Biskamp
and Welter. The Gibbs ensemble method developed in this work admits extension
to other Hamiltonian systems with invariants not higher than quadratic in the
highest-order-derivative variables. The turbulence in two dimensional Euler
fluid is of a different nature: there the coherent structures are also formed,
but the fluctuations about these structures are non-Gaussian.

equivalent to construction of an analogue F(p) of the twisting element F which
