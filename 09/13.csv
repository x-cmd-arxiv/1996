describe a new method of galaxy photometry adopted to derive the photometric
parameters of the EFAR galaxies. The algorithm fits the circularized surface
brightness profiles as the sum of two seeing-convolved components, an $R^{1/4}$
and an exponential law. This approach allows us to fit the large variety of
luminosity profiles displayed by the EFAR galaxies homogeneously and to derive
(for at least a subset of these) bulge and disk parameters. Multiple exposures
of the same objects are optimally combined and an optional sky-fitting
procedure has been developed to correct for sky subtraction errors. Extensive
Monte Carlo simulations are analyzed to test the performance of the algorithm
and estimate the size of random and {\it systematic} errors. Random errors are
small, provided that the global signal-to-noise ratio of the fitted profiles is
larger than $\approx 300$. Systematic errors can result from 1) errors in the
sky subtraction, 2) the limited radial extent of the fitted profiles, 3) the
lack of resolution due to seeing convolution and pixel sampling, 4) the use of
circularized profiles for very flattened objects seen edge-on and 5) a poor
match of the fitting functions to the object profiles. Large systematic errors
are generated by the widely used simple $R^{1/4}$ law to fit luminosity
profiles when a disk component, as small as 20% of the total light, is present.

properties of the ground state of matter above neutron drip density, $4.3
\times 10^{11} g cm^{-3}$. Recent experimental values and extrapolations of
nuclear masses are used for a description of matter at densities below neutron
drip. Changes in the pressure of matter in the crust due to the stellar
spin-down are calculated by taking into account the structure of the crust of a
slowly and uniformly rotating relativistic neutron star. If the initial
rotation period is $\sim$ ms, these changes cause nuclei, initially being in
the ground-state matter above a mass density of about $3 \times 10^{13} g
cm^{-3}$, to absorb neutrons in the equatorial region where the matter
undergoes compression, and to emit them in the vicinity of the rotation axis
where the matter undergoes decompression. Heat generation by these processes is
found to have significant effects on the thermal evolution of old neutron stars
with low magnetic fields; the surface emission predicted from this heating is
compared with the $ROSAT$ observations of X-ray emission from millisecond
pulsars and is shown to be insufficient to explain the observed X-ray
luminosities.

relativity lack a sensible continuum limit that reproduces general relativity.
The basic problem is that generic physical states lack long ranged
correlations, because the form of the state allows a division into spatial
regions, such that no change in the physical state in one region can be
measured by observables restricted to another. These disconnected regions have
generically finite expectation value of physical volume, which means that the
theory has no long ranged correlations or massless particles. One consequence
of this is that the $ADM$ energy is unbounded from below, at least when that is
defined with respect to a natural notion of quantum asymptotic flatness and a
corresponding definition of an operator that measures $E_{ADM}$ (which is given
here). These problems occur in Thiemann's new formulation of quantum gravity.
Related issues arise in some other approaches such as that of Borissov, Rovelli
and Smolin. A new approach to the Hamiltonian constraint, which may avoid the
problem of the lack of long ranged correlations, is proposed.

complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equations with a spatially dependent coupling
coefficient. Group-velocity terms are added to the NLD and RGL equations, which
breaks the variational structure of these models. In the simplest case of two
coupled NLD equations, we reduce the description of stationary configurations
to a single second-order ordinary differential equation. We demonstrate
analytically that a necessary condition for existence of a stationary DW is
that the group-velocity must be below a certain threshold value. Above this
threshold, dynamical behavior sets in, which we consider in detail. In the CGL
equations, the DW may generate spatio-temporal chaos, depending on the
nonlinear dispersion.

for the parameters $\epsilon=1$, $\alpha=-1$, $\beta=3$ and $\kappa=\tfr12$,
admits a wave of greatest height, as a peaked limiting form of the travelling
wave solution; the Rosenau-Hyman equation, for the parameters $\epsilon=0$,
$\alpha=1$, $\beta=3$ and $\kappa=0$, admits a ``compacton'' solitary wave
solution; and the Fuchssteiner-Fokas-Camassa-Holm equation, for the parameters
$\epsilon=1$, $\alpha=-3$ and $\beta=2$, has a ``peakon'' solitary wave
solution. A catalogue of symmetry reductions for equation (1) is obtained using
the classical Lie method and the nonclassical method due to Bluman and Cole.

  Transcendent","28 pages, amstex, no figures",,,"UKC/IMS/96/45","solv-int nlin.SI",,"  In this work we propose a new method for investigating connection problems
for the class of nonlinear second-order differential equations known as the
Painlev{\'e} equations. Such problems can be characterized by the question as
to how the asymptotic behaviours of solutions are related as the independent
variable is allowed to pass towards infinity along different directions in the
complex plane. Connection problems have been previously tackled by a variety of
methods. Frequently these are based on the ideas of isomonodromic deformation
and the matching of WKB solutions. However, the implementation of these methods
often tends to be heuristic in nature and so the task of rigorising the process
is complicated. The method we propose here develops uniform approximations to
solutions. This removes the need to match solutions, is rigorous, and can lead
to the solution of connection problems with minimal computational effort. Our
method is reliant on finding uniform approximations of differential equations
of the generic form ${d^2\phi}/{d\eta^2} = - \xi^2F(\eta,\xi)\phi$ as the
complex-valued parameter $\xi \to \infty.$ The details of the treatment rely
heavily on the locations of the zeros of the function $F$ in this limit. If
they are isolated then a uniform approximation to solutions can be derived in
terms of Airy functions of suitable argument. On the other hand, if two of the
zeros of $F$ coalesce as $|\xi| \to \infty$ then an approximation can be
derived in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. In this paper we discuss both
cases, but illustrate our technique in action by applying the parabolic
cylinder case to the ``classical'' connection problem associated with the
second Painlev{\'e} transcendent. Future papers will show how the technique can
be applied with very little change to the other Painlev{\'e} equations, and to
the wider problem of the asymptotic behaviour of the general solution to any of
these equations.
