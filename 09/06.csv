any feature resonant with a bar. Because of their large scale, their morphology
is sensitive to the distribution of the dark matter in the galaxy. We introduce
here how study of these rings can constrain the mass-to-light ratio of the bar,
and so the percentage of dark matter in the center of these galaxies. We
compare periodic orbits integrated in the ringed galaxy NGC 6782 near the outer
Lindblad resonance to the shape of the outer ring. The non-axisymmetric
component of the potential resulting from the bar is derived from a
near-infrared image of the galaxy. The axisymmetric component is derived
assuming a flat rotation curve. We find that the pinched non-self-intersecting
periodic orbits are more elongated for higher bar mass-to-light ratios and
faster bars. The inferred mass-to-light ratio of the bar depends on the assumed
inclination of the galaxy. With an assumed galaxy inclination of i=41 degrees,
for the orbits to be consistent with the observed ring morphology the
mass-to-light ratio of the bar must be high, greater than 70% of a maximal disk
value. For i=45 degrees, the mass-to-light ratio of the bar is $75\pm 15%$ of
the maximal disk value. Since the velocity field of these rings can be used to
constrain the galaxy inclination as well as which periodic orbit is represented
in the ring, further study will yield tighter constraints on the mass-to-light
ratio of the bar. If a near maximal disk value for the bar is required, then
either there would be little dark matter within the bar, or the dark matter
contained in the disk of the galaxy would be non-axisymmetric and would rotate

emerges between the expected iron abundances in the hot interstellar medium

allowance is made for the current iron enrichment by Type Ia supernovae. This
strong discrepancy, that in some extreme instances may be as large as a factor
of $\sim 20$, calls into question our current understanding of supernova
enrichment and chemical evolution of galaxies. We discuss several astrophysical
implications of the inferred low iron abundances in the ISM, including the
chemical evolution of galaxies and cluster of galaxies, the evolution of gas
flows in ellipticals, and the heating of the intracluster medium. Some of the
consequences appear hard to accept, and in the attempt to avoid some of these
difficulties we explore ways of hiding or diluting iron in the ISM of
ellipticals. None of these possibilities appears astrophysically plausible, and
we alternatively rise the question of the reliability of iron-L line
diagonostic tools. Various thin plasma emission models are shown to give iron
abundances that may differ significantly, especially at low temperatures ($kT
\lsim 1$ keV). From a collection of ASCA and other X-ray observatory data, it
is shown that current thin plasma codes tend to give very low iron abundances
when the temperature of the objects is below $\sim 1$ keV. We conclude that --
besides rethinking the chemical evolution of galaxies -- one should also
consider the possibility that existing thin plasma models may incorporate
inaccurate atomic physics for the ions responsible for the iron-L complex.

  The Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/304622",,"astro-ph",,"  It is demonstrated that clusters of galaxies are able to keep cosmic rays for
a time exceeding the age of the Universe. This phenomenon reveals itself by the
production of the diffuse flux of high energy gamma and neutrino radiation due
to the interaction of the cosmic rays with the intracluster gas. The produced
flux is determined by the cosmological density of baryons, $\Omega_b$, if a
large part of this density is provided by the intracluster gas. The signal from
relic cosmic rays has to be compared with the flux produced by the late
sources, which can be considered as a background in the search for cosmic ray
production in the past. We calculate this flux considering the normal galaxies
and AGN in the clusters as the sources of cosmic rays. Another potential cosmic
ray source is the shock in the gas accreting to a cluster. We found that this
background is relatively high: the diffuse fluxes produced by relic cosmic rays
are of the same order of magnitude which can be expected from AGN in the
clusters. In all cases the predicted diffuse gamma-ray flux is smaller than the
observed one and the diffuse neutrino flux can be seen as the small bump at
$E\sim 10^6~GeV$ over the atmospheric neutrino flux. A bright phase in the
galaxy evolution can be a source of the relic cosmic rays in clusters,
revealing itself by diffuse gamma and neutrino radiations. We found that the
observation of a signal from the bright phase is better for an individual
cluster.

of equilibrium stellar dynamics. Restricting our analysis to the virialized
region, a prescription to limit the accessible phase-space is presented, which
permits the construction of both the isotropic and the anisotropic distribution
functions $f(E)$ and $f(E,L)$. The method is applied to models extracted from a
catalogue of simulated clusters. Clusters evolved in open and flat background
cosmologies are followed during the course of their evolution, and are found to
transit through a sequence of what we define as `quasi-equilibrium' states. An
interesting feature is that the computed $f(E)$ is well fit by an exponential
form. We conclude that the dynamical evolution of a cluster, undergoing
relaxation punctuated by interactions and violent mergers with consequent
energy-exchange, can be studied both in a qualitative and quantitative fashion
by following the time evolution of $f(E)$.

galaxies in the framework of a Compton cooled corona model. Variations in the
optical depth tau of the corona cause spectral changes in the Comptonized
emission in the sense that the spectrum steepens and the temperature decreases
with increasing tau. If the corona is pair dominated, tau is determined by the
compactness (proportional to luminosity for fixed size). This yields a definite
relation between spectral shape and intensity implying a variation in intensity
of a factor 10 for a change of 0.2 in the 2-10 keV spectral index. For low pair
density coronae, no definite prediction is possible. In the absence of
substantial changes in the structure of the corona, the soft thermal component
correlates with the medium-hard Comptonized component. Examples are computed
using the ROSAT response matrix, showing that current observations of NGC 5548

spectral behaviour of Mrk 766 strongly suggests that the coronal plasma in this

ratios (PRs), where we take for the X-ray emissivity j_gas propto rho^2_DM,
which we argue is a suitable approximation for analysis of PRs. We find that
Omega_0 primarily influences the means of the PR distributions whereas the
power spectrum (n and sigma_8) primarily affects their variances:
log_10(P_3/P_0) is the cleanest probe of Omega_0 since its mean is very
sensitive to Omega_0 but very insensitive to P(k). The PR means easily
distinguish the SCDM and OCDM models, while the SCDM and LCDM means show a more
modest, but significant, difference (3 sigma). The OCDM and LCDM models are
largely indistinguishable in terms of the PRs. Finally, we compared these
models to a sample of ROSAT clusters and find that the cluster morphologies
strongly disfavor Omega_0=1, CDM while favoring low density, CDM models with or

dependence (1) flattens the, otherwise, monochromatic Poissonian
variability--luminosity relationship; and (2) decreases the asymptotic value of
the structure function, which reveals that the elementary pulse driving the
variations would have a characteristic time scale of 85--280 days. The upper
limit is consistent with the time scale found in nearby Seyfert galaxies.
Shorter values of this time scale are expected if the metallicity of high

not follow the variability--wavelength dependence observed in Seyfert nuclei

to estimate higher-order perturbative corrections and nonperturbative
corrections to the longitudinal cross section $\sigma_L$ and discuss the
prospects of determining $\alpha_s$ from $\sigma_L$. The structure of infrared
renormalons in the perturbative expansion suggests that the longitudinal cross
section for hadron production with fixed momentum fraction $x$ receives
nonperturbative contributions of order $1/(x^2Q^2)$, whereas the total cross
section has a larger, $1/Q$ correction. This correction arises from very large
longitudinal distances and is related to the behaviour of the Borel integral
for the cross section with fixed $x$ at large values of the Borel parameter.

potential in QCD in terms of a Wilson Loop $W_{eff}(\Gamma)$ determined by the

classical approximation gives the leading contribution to $W_{eff}(\Gamma)$ and
yields a velocity dependent heavy quark potential which for large $R$ becomes
linear in $R$, and which for small $R$ approaches lowest order perturbative
QCD. The corresponding long distance interaction between color magnetic
monopoles is governed by a Yukawa potential. As a consequence the magnetic
interaction between the color magnetic moments of the quarks is exponentially
