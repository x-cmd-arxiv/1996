in the image frames to determine the point spread function (PSF), we
PSF-subtract the images of GRS1915+105. We find no evidence of extended
emission such as the apparent near-IR jets seen by Sams et al. (1996) in July,
1995. Simple modelling of the star + jet structure allows us to place an upper
limit on any similar emission at that position of $K>16.4$ at the 95%
confidence level, as compared to $K=13.9$ as seen by Sams et al. (1996). This
lack of extended IR flux during continued hard X-ray flaring activity confirms
the hypothesis that the extended IR emission arises from the superluminal
radio-emitting jets rather than reprocessing of the X-ray emission on other
structures around the compact central object. Given the large apparent velocity
of the radio-emitting jets, by the time of our observations the Sams et al.
feature would have moved $>1$ arcsec from GRS1915+105, and we can place a limit
of $K>17.7$ (95% confidence level) on any infrared emission in this region. We
can thus place an upper limit on the radiative timescale of the feature of
$\tau < 25$ days, which is consistent with synchrotron jet emission.

predicted by stellar and galactic chemical evolution remains largely
unexplained. In this paper, we attempt to shed some light on this unsolved
problem by presenting a quantitative comparison of the 3He abundances recently
measured in six planetary nebulae (PNe) with the corresponding predictions of
stellar evolution theory. The determination of the mass of the PNe progenitors
allows us to dismiss, to a good degree of confidence, the hypothesis that the
abundance of 3He in the envelope of all low-mass stars is strongly reduced with
respect to the standard theoretical values by some mixing mechanism acting in
the latest phases of stellar evolution. The abundance versus mass correlation,
allowance made for the limitation of the sample, is in fact found to be fully
consistent with the classical prediction of stellar evolution. We examine the
implications of this result on the galactic evolution of 3He with the help of a
series of models with standard and non-standard nucleosynthesis prescriptions.
The results are found to be consistent with the observed galactic abundances
only if the vast majority of low-mass stars follows non-standard prescriptions.
This implies that either the sample of PNe nebulae under exam is highly biased,
or the solution to the 3He problem lies elsewhere.

the spatial distribution and kinematics of the objects are known, the slope and
the range of the MHO mass function (modeled here by a simple power law) will be
possible to determine from 100-1000 detected events if the slope \alpha is in
the range [-2.5, -0.5], with the statistical errors reaching their minima at
\alpha =-1.5. Outside this range the errors grow rapidly making the inference
difficult even at very large numbers of events (N\approx 10000). On the other
hand, the average mass of the MHOs will be determined to better than about 30%
accuracy from N\approx 100 events for any slope. We find that the accuracy of
inference at fixed N will not be strongly affected by the presently available
detection efficiencies if the typical MHO masses are in the range indicated by
the events detected so far.
  We also estimate the effects of uncertainty of the MHOs' spatial distribution
and kinematics on the determination of their mass function. The halo models
considered are all spherical but we allow for various density profiles and a
radius-dependent, anisotropic velocity dispersion. We find that, while the mass
function slope and range are weakly affected for -2 < \alpha < 0, the error in
the average mass due to the halo uncertainties could be reduced to less than
50% only through the detection of about 1000 or more events. Reliable estimates
of the halo structure itself [density profile and velocity dispersion profile]
can start only at very large numbers of detections (N ~ 10000).

integrable equations and string equations. Coupling the Toda equations and the
string equations, we derive a special case of the Painlev\'{e} III equation.
From the Virasoro constrains, we can use the radial coordinate. The relation
between $t_{1}$ and $t_{-1}$ is like the complex conjugate. %An implicit to the
$t\bar{t}$ fusion of topological sigma model %is therby expected.

energies that depend on two nondegenerate quantum numbers. For such systems,
the evolution of the wave packet is controlled by two classical periods and
three revival times. These wave packets exhibit quantum beats in the initial
motion as well as new types of long-term revivals. The issue of whether
fractional revivals can form is addressed. We present an analytical proof
showing that at certain times equal to rational fractions of the revival times
the wave packet can reform as a sum of subsidiary waves and that both
conventional and new types of fractional revivals can occur.

  1996",,,,"quant-ph gr-qc",,"  It is shown that certain structures in classical General Relativity can give
rise to non-classical logic, normally associated with Quantum Mechanics. A
4-geon model of an elementary particle is proposed which is asymptotically
flat, particle-like and has a non-trivial causal structure. The usual Cauchy
data are no longer sufficient to determine a unique evolution. The measurement
apparatus itself can impose non-redundant boundary conditions. Measurements of
such an object would fail to satisfy the distributive law of classical physics.
This model reconciles General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics without the need
for Quantum Gravity. The equations of Quantum Mechanics are unmodified but it
is not universal; classical particles and waves could exist and there is no
graviton.

spin in a relativistic way. Two versions are discussed: The one using the spin
operator defined via the relativistic center-of-mass operator, and the one
using the Pauli-Lubanski vector. Both are shown to lead to the SAME prediction
for the EPRB experiment: The degree of violation of the Bell inequality
DECREASES with growing velocity of the EPR pair of spin-1/2 particles. The
phenomenon can be physically understood as a combined effect of the Lorentz
contraction and the Moller shift of the relativistic center of mass. The effect
is therefore stronger than standard relativistic phenomena such as the Lorentz
contraction or time dilatation. The fact that the Bell inequality is in general
less violated than in the nonrelativistic case will have to be taken into
account in tests for eavesdropping if massive particles will be used for a key
transfer.
