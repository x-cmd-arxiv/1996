a region with radius >~ 15 arc min. Using scattering from Sgr A* and other
sources, we show that pulse broadening for pulsars in the Galactic center is
{\em at least} 6.3 \nu^{-4} seconds (\nu = radio frequency in GHz) and is most
likely 50--200 times larger because the relevant scattering screen appears to
be within the Galactic center region itself. Pulsars beyond---but viewed
through---the Galactic center suffer even greater pulse broadening and are
angularly broadened by <~ 2 {\em arc min}. Periodicity searches at radio
frequencies are likely to find only long period pulsars and, then, only if
optimized by using frequencies >~ 7 GHz and by testing for small numbers of
harmonics in the power spectrum. The optimal frequency is $\nu ~ 7.3 GHz
(\Delta_{0.1}P\sqrt{\alpha})^{-1/4}$ where \Delta_{0.1} is the distance of the
scattering region from Sgr A* in units of 0.1 kpc, P is the period (seconds),
and \alpha is the spectral index. A search for compact sources using aperture
synthesis may be far more successful than searches for periodicities because
the angular broadening is not so large as to desensitize the survey. We
estimate that the number of {\em detectable} pulsars in the Galactic center may
range from <= 1 to 100, with the larger values resulting from recent, vigorous
starbursts. Such pulsars provide unique opportunities for probing the ionized
gas, gravitational potential, and stellar population near Sgr A*.

galaxies NGC 720 (E4) and NGC 1332 (E7/S0) with emphasis on constraining the
relative contribution to the X-ray emission from hot gas and the integrated
emission from X-ray binaries. Single-temperature spectral models yield poor
fits to the spectrum ($\chi^2_{red}\sim 3$) over the $\sim 0.5 - 5$ keV energy
range. Two-temperature models significantly improve the spectral fits
($\chi^2_{red}\sim 1.5$) and have soft-component temperatures and sub-solar
abundances consistent with previous $ROSAT$ single-temperature models
($T_{soft}\sim 0.6$ keV, abundances $\sim 0.1$) and hard-component temperatures
($T_{hard}\gtrsim 3$ keV) consistent with those expected from a discrete
component. The soft component dominates the emission in both galaxies,
especially in the 0.4 - 2.4 keV band used in previous $ROSAT$ studies.
Combining these spectral results with $ROSAT$ data we updated constraints on
the mass distributions for NGC 720 and NGC 1332. For NGC 720, which yields the
more precise constraints, the ellipticity of the intrinsic shape of the mass is
slightly reduced $(\Delta\epsilon_{mass}\approx 0.05)$ when the discrete
component is added, $\epsilon_{mass}\sim 0.4-0.6$ $(90%)$. The estimates for
the total mass increase with increasing discrete flux, and we find that models
with $F_{hard}/F_{soft}=0.45$, the $2\sigma$ upper limit, have masses that
exceed by $\sim 30% - 50%$ those where $F_{hard}/F_{soft}=0$.

interpolation of X-ray observations of the 200 X-ray brightest clusters gives a
firm lower limit of approximately 3000 detected clusters of which roughly half

canonical ensemble in models of random geometries. As an example we consider a
solvable model of branched polymers where the transition leading from tree- to
bush-like polymers relies on the occurrence of vertices with a large number of
branches. The source of this transition is a combination of the constraint on
the total number of branches in the canonical ensemble and a nonlinear
one-vertex action. We argue that exactly the same mechanism, which we call
constrained mean-field, plays the crucial role in the phase transition in 4d
simplicial gravity and, when applied to the effective one-vertex action,
explains the occurrence of both the mother universe and singular vertices at
the transition point when the system enters the crumpled phase.

larger signal branching fraction. It is emphasized that the hadron energy

perturbative QCD corrections, the Fermi motion of the $b$-quark in the
