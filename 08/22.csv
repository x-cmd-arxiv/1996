distribution of point masses. We derive the macroimage magnification
distribution P(A) at high magnification (A-1 >> tau^2) for a low optical depth
(tau << 1) lens distribution by modeling the illumination pattern as a
superposition of the patterns due to individual ``point mass plus weak shear''
lenses. We show that a point mass plus weak shear lens produces an astroid-
shaped caustic and that the magnification cross-section obeys a simple scaling
property. By convolving this cross-section with the shear distribution, we
obtain a caustic-induced feature in P(A) which also exhibits a simple scaling
property. This feature results in a 20% enhancement in P(A) at A approx 2/tau.
In the low magnification (A-1 << 1) limit, the macroimage consists of a bright
primary image and a large number of faint secondary images formed close to each
of the point masses. Taking into account the correlations between the primary
and secondary images, we derive P(A) for low A. The low-A distribution has a
peak of amplitude ~ 1/tau^2 at A-1 ~ tau^2 and matches smoothly to the high-A
distribution. We combine the high- and low-A results and obtain a practical
semi-analytic expression for P(A). This semi-analytic distribution is in
qualitative agreement with previous numerical results, but the latter show
stronger caustic-induced features at moderate A for tau as small as 0.1. We
resolve this discrepancy by re-examining the criterion for low optical depth. A
simple argument shows that the fraction of caustics of individual lenses that
merge with those of their neighbors is approx 1-exp(-8 tau). For tau=0.1, the
fraction is surprisingly high: approx 55%. For the purpose of computing P(A) in
the manner we did, low optical depth corresponds to tau << 1/8.

distribution of point masses. In this second paper, we extend the analysis to a
three-dimensional lens distribution. First we study the lensing properties of
three-dimensional lens distributions by considering in detail the critical
curves, the caustics, the illumination patterns, and the magnification
cross-sections sigma(A) of multiplane configurations with two, three, and four
point masses. For N_\ast point masses that are widely separated in Lagrangian
space, we find that there are ~ 2^{N_\ast} - 1 critical curves in total, but
that only ~ N_\ast of these produce prominent caustic-induced features at the
high magnification end of sigma(A).
  In the case of a low optical depth random distribution of point masses, we
show that the multiplane lens equation near a point mass can be reduced to the
single plane equation of a point mass perturbed by weak shear. This allows us
to calculate the caustic-induced feature in the macroimage magnification
distribution P(A) as a weighted sum of the semi-analytic feature derived in
Paper I for a planar lens distribution. The resulting semi-analytic
caustic-induced feature is similar to the feature in the planar case, but it
does not have any simple scaling properties, and it is shifted to higher
magnification. The semi-analytic distribution is compared to the results of
previous numerical simulations for optical depth tau ~ 0.1, and they are in
better agreement than a similar comparison in the planar case. We explain this
by estimating the fraction of caustics of individual lenses that merge with
those of their neighbors. For tau=0.1, the fraction is approx 20%, much less
than the approx 55% for the planar case.

sufficient information on the distant events is stressed and the observations

providing clear evidence of universal expansion. The observations are fully
consistent with local Type Ia supernovae in an expanding universe but
incompatible with the expectations from a static universe. The contributions of
the new, large telescopes to this research area are described. The extension of
the observations to even more distant objects will provide a better leverage to
distinguish between the possible decelerations and the inclusion of Type II
supernovae into the sample add an independent check on the cosmological

has show great promise, however its application is limited by the paradigm to
the domain of spin space. Our conjecture is that there is a broader principle
at work which applies even to classical physics. Specifically, the laws of
physics should be invariant under polydimensional transformations which
reshuffle the geometry (e.g. exchanges vectors for trivectors) but preserves
the algebra. To complete the symmetry, it follows that the laws of physics must
be themselves polydimensional, having scalar, vector, bivector etc. parts in
one multivector equation. Clifford algebra is the natural language in which to
formulate this principle, as vectors/tensors were for relativity. This allows
for a new treatment of the relativistic spinning particle (the Papapetrou
equations) which is problematic in standard theory. In curved space the rank of
the geometry will change under parallel transport, yielding a new basis for
Weyl's connection and a natural coupling between linear and spinning motion.

sequence of real space renormalization group (RG) or blockspin transformations.
They transform to effective theories on coarser and coarser lattices.The
ultimate aim is to compute constraint effective potentials, i.e. the free
energy as a function of suitable order parameters.From the free energy one can
read off the thermodynamic behaviour of the theory, in particular the existence
and nature of phase transitions. In a finite temperature QFT one begins with
either one or a sequence of transformations which transform the original theory
into an effective theory on a three-dimensional lattice. Its effective action
has temperature dependent coefficients. Thereafter one may proceed with further
blockspin transformations of the three-dimensional theory. Assuming a finite
volume, this can in principle be continued until one ends with a lattice with a
single site. Its effective action is the constraint effective potential. In
each RG-step, an integral over the high frequency part of the field has to be
performed. This is done perturbatively and requires the knowledge of bare
fluctuation field propagators and of interpolation operators which enter into
the vertices. A detailed examination of these quantities is presented for
scalar fields, abelian gauge fields and for Higgs fields, finite temperature is

which corresponds to using an effective action obtained by integrating out the

which are sensitive to the nonperturbative magnetic screening mass still remain
incalculable in this resummed perturbation theory. A different breakdown of the
latter occurs whenever external momenta are light-like, because the hard
thermal loops themselves develop collinear singularities. However, taking into
account asymptotic thermal masses for the hard modes regulates the hard thermal
loops without spoiling their gauge invariance.
