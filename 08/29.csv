$X$ there exist numbers $c(X)$ and $C(X)$ with the following properties: For
any threefold $Y$ of general type the number of dominant rational maps $f:X \r
Y$ is bounded above by $c(X)$. The number of threefolds $Y$, modulo birational
equivalence, for which there exist dominant rational maps $f:X \r Y$, is
bounded above by $C(X)$. If, moreover, $X$ is a threefold of general type, we
prove that $c(X)$ and $C(X)$ only depend on the index $r_{X_c}$ of the

experimental evidence that jets, powered by supermassive black holes, are true
cosmic accelerators. They produce photons of TeV energy, possible higher, and
may be the enigmatic source of the highest energy cosmic rays. The features of
the multi-wavelength emission spectrum are dictated by the interactions of
electrons and protons, accelerated in the vicinity of the black hole, with the
ambient light in the galaxy. Photoproduction of neutral pions by protons on UV
light is the source of the highest energy photons, in which most of the
bolometric luminosity of the galaxy may be emitted. They initiate an
electromagnetic cascade which via pair production on the magnetic field and
photon-photon interactions determines the emerging gamma-ray spectrum at lower
energies. The lower energy photons, observed by conventional astronomical
techniques, are, as a result of the cascade process, several generations
removed from the primary high energy beams. The case that proton beams power
active galaxies is far from conclusive. A three-prong technological assault on
the problem will, in the near future, hopefully provide new insights into the
structure of active galactic nuclei with the construction of second-generation
atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, large-scale EeV cosmic ray detectors and high
energy neutrino telescopes.

established that ~ 5e4 BSs with dense, decelerating winds can reproduce the

we use the observed properties of AGN line profiles to further constrain the
model parameters. In the BS model, the origin of the broad profiles is the
stellar velocity field in the vicinity of the central black hole. We use a
detailed photoionization code and a model of the stellar distribution function
to calculate the BS emission line profiles and compare them to a large sample
of AGN CIV, CIII] and MgII profiles. We find that the BSs can reproduce the
general shape and width of typical AGN profiles as well as the line ratios if
(i) The ionizing luminosity to black hole mass ratio is low enough. (ii) The
broad line region size is limited by some cutoff mechanism. (iii) The fraction
of the BSs in the stellar population falls off roughly as r^-2. (iv) The wind
density and/or velocity are correlated with the black hole mass and ionizing
luminosity. Under these conditions the strong tidal forces near the black hole
play an important role in determining the line emission properties of the BSs.
Some discrepancies remain: the calculated BS profiles tend to have weaker wings
than the observed ones, and the differences between the profiles of different
lines are somewhat smaller than those observed.

introduce new methods which easily allow us to determine the location (rotation
angle relative to the image positions) of the major axis of the lensing galaxy.

magnetization to each fermion to separate the current into magnetization and
transport contributions, associated with the cyclotron and guiding center

predicts the $m_b$ dependence of the static and dynamic response in the limit

an $n$-stack. We construct the flexible sheaf associated to a flexible presheaf
in the $n$-truncated case, as an application of a certain natural operation
$n+2$ times. We prove an analogue of Vogt's theorem for the case where the
Grothendieck topology is nontrivial, identifying the set of morphisms in
Illusie's derived category as the set of homotopy classes of homotopy-coherent
morphisms between flexible sheaves. The homotopy-coherent point of view allows
one easily to define the flexible mapping sheaf $Hom (R,T)$ between two
flexible sheaves.

localization time is typically greater than the decoherence time, but much
shorter than the relaxation time, $\gamma^{-1}$. We use this result to show
that the reduced density operator rapidly evolves into a state which is
approximately diagonal in a set of generalized coherent states. We thus
reproduce, using a completely different method, a result we previously obtained
using the quantum state diffusion picture (Phys.Rev. D52, 7294 (1995)). We also
go beyond this earlier result, in that we derive an explicit expression for the
weighting of each phase space localized state in the approximately diagonal
density matrix, as a function of the initial state. For sufficiently long times
it is equal to the Wigner function, and we confirm that the Wigner function is
positive for times greater than the localization time (multiplied by a number
