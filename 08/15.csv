of capture of compact objects by massive central black holes, assuming most
spiral galaxies have a central black hole of modest mass ($\sim 10^6 \msun$),
and a cuspy spheroid. It is likely that the total capture rate is dominated by
nucleated spirals. We estimate the flux of gravitational wave radiation from
such coalescences, and the estimated detectable source count for proposed
space--based gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. About one event per
year should be detectable within $1 \, {\rm Gpc}$, given very conservative
estimates of the black hole masses and central galactic densities. We expect
$10^2$--$10^3$ detectable sources at lower frequencies ($10^{-4}$ Hz) ``en
route'' to capture. If stellar mass black holes are ubiquitous, the signal may
be dominated by stellar mass black holes coalescing with massive black holes.
The rate of white dwarf--white dwarf mergers in the cores of nucleated spirals
is estimated at $\sim10^{-6}$ per year per galaxy.

reproduces the classical algebra in the continuum and has as solutions lattice

from Chern--Simons theory in the lattice context, including the issue of

show that two knot invariants from Chern--Simons theory are annihilated by the

a measure of the W width. We look at alternative variables to see if the

better measure of the W width. We find that the transverse mass is very close
to the optimal variable for separating on from off mass shell W decay, and
hence there is little to be gained by using other, more complicated, variables.
This happens because if the transverse mass is above the W mass, the W is
guaranteed to be produced off mass shell.

caused by the appearance of some topological defects is familiar in the context
of domain walls, where the defect statistics lend themselves naturally to a
percolation theory description, and for cosmic strings, where the proportion of
infinite strings can be varied or disappear entirely depending on the bias in
the symmetry. In this paper we measure the initial configurational statistics
of a network of string defects after a symmetry-breaking phase transition with
initial bias in the symmetry of the ground state. Using an improved algorithm,
which is useful for a more general class of self-interacting walks on an
infinite lattice, we extend the work in \cite{MHKS} to better statistics and a
different ground state manifold, namely $\R P^2$, and explore various different
discretisations. Within the statistical errors, the critical exponents of the
Hagedorn transition are found to be quite possibly universal and identical to
the critical exponents of three-dimensional bond or site percolation. This
improves our understanding of the percolation theory description of defect
statistics after a biased phase transition, as proposed in \cite{MHKS}. We also
find strong evidence that the existence of infinite strings in the Vachaspati
Vilenkin algorithm is generic to all (string-bearing) vacuum manifolds, all
discretisations thereof, and all regular three-dimensional lattices.

earlier calculations by other authors we do not find that the perturbative

obtain a substantial damping of the magnetic oscillations in the mixed state as
compared to the normal state. We have examined the effect of an oscillatory
