levels in a randomly chosen interval of length $L$, and the distribution of
$n(L)$, where $n(L)$ is the number of levels in such an interval, and their
cumulants $c_k(L)$. It is demonstrated that the cumulants provide a possible
measure for the distinction between chaotic and non-chaotic systems. The
vanishing of the normalized cumulants $C_k$, $k\geq 3$, implies a Gaussian
behaviour of $P(W)$, which is realized in the case of chaotic systems, whereas
non-chaotic systems display non-vanishing values for these cumulants leading to
a non-Gaussian behaviour of $P(W)$. For some integrable systems there exist
rigorous proofs of the non-Gaussian behaviour which are also discussed. Our
numerical results and the rigorous results for integrable systems suggest that
a clear fingerprint of chaotic systems is provided by a Gaussian distribution

i.e., quasiparticles carrying fractional charges and obeying fractional
statistics. To find out how the properties of these quasiparticles manifest
themselves in the optical spectra, we have developed the anyon exciton model
(AEM) and compared the results with the finite-size data for excitons of nu=1/3
and nu=2/3 IQL's. The model considers an exciton as a neutral composite
consisting of three quasielectrons and a single hole. The AEM works well when
the separation between electron and hole confinement planes, h, is larger than
the magnetic length l. In the framework of the AEM an exciton possesses
momentum k and two internal quantum numbers, one of which can be chosen as the
angular momentum, L, of the k=0 state. Existence of the internal degrees of
freedom results in the multiple branch energy spectrum, crater-like electron
density shape and 120 degrees density correlations for k=0 excitons, and the
splitting of the electron shell into bunches for non-zero k excitons. For h
larger than 2l the bottom states obey the superselection rule L=3m (m are
integers starting from 2), all of them are hard core states. For h nearly 2l
there is one-to-one correspondence between the low-energy spectra found for the
AEM and the many- electron exciton spectra of the nu=2/3 IQL, whereas some
states are absent from the many-electron spectra of the nu=1/3 IQL. We argue
that this striking difference in the spectra originates from the different
populational statistics of the quasielectrons of charge conjugate IQL's and
show that the proper account of the statistical requirements eliminates
excessive states from the spectrum. Apparently, this phenomenon is the first
manifestation of the exclusion statistics in the anyon bound states.

consistently truncated to yield a variety of maximally-supersymmetric

arise as a consequence of making a more general ansatz than that in usual
Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction, in which one or more axions are given an
additional linear dependence on one of the compactification coordinates. The
lower-dimensional theories are nevertheless consistent truncations of
eleven-dimensional supergravity. Owing to the fact that the generalised
reduction commutes neither with U-duality nor with ordinary dimensional
reduction, many different massive theories can result. The simplest examples
arise when just a single axion has the additional linear coordinate dependence.
We find five inequivalent such theories in D=7, and 71 inequivalent ones in
D=4. The massive theories admit no maximally-symmetric vacuum solution, but
they do admit $(D-2)$-brane solutions, i.e. domain walls, which preserve half

Glozman et al. where the chromomagnetic hyperfine interaction is replaced by
pseudoscalar-meson exchange. We find that such an interaction binds a heavy
tetraquark system $QQ\bar q\bar q$ ($Q=c, b$ and $q=u, d)$ by $0.2-0.4$ GeV.
This is at variance with results of previous models where $cc\bar q\bar q$ is
unstable.

  cubic-quintic Schrodinger equation","Latex, 39 pages, 7 figures (type ""latex main"" to latex the paper)",,,,"patt-sol nlin.PS",,"  The existence of bright and dark multi-bump solitary waves for
Ginzburg-Landau type perturbations of the cubic-quintic Schrodinger equation is
considered. The waves in question are not perturbations of known analytic
solitary waves, but instead arise as a bifurcation from a heteroclinic cycle in
a three dimensional ODE phase space. Using geometric singular perturbation
techniques, regions in parameter space for which 1-bump bright and dark
solitary waves will bifurcate are identified. The existence of N-bump dark
solitary waves is shown via an application of the Exchange Lemma with
Exponentially Small Error. N-bump bright solitary waves are shown to exist as a
consequence of the previous work of S. Maier-Paape and this author.

``unraveled'' into individual ``trajectories,'' providing powerful numerical
and conceptual tools. In this letter we use quantum trajectories to study
mesoscopic systems and their classical limit. We show that in this limit,
Quantum Jump (QJ) trajectories approach a diffusive limit very similar to the
Quantum State Diffusion (QSD) unraveling. The latter follows classical
trajectories in the classical limit. Hence, both unravelings show the rise of
classical orbits. This is true for both regular and chaotic systems (which
exhibit strange attractors).

These wave packets
have energies depending on two quantum numbers and are characterized by two
sets of classical periods and revival times. The additional time scales result
in revival structures different from those of free Rydberg wave packets. We
show that Stark wave packets can exhibit fractional revivals. We also show that
these wave packets exhibit particular features unique to the Stark effect. For
instance, the wave functions can be separated into distinct sums over even and
odd values of the principal quantum number. These even and odd superpositions
interfere in different ways, which results in unexpected periodicities in the
interferograms of Stark wave packets.

hydrogen-like system driven by a laser exhibits macroscopic dark periods,
provided there exists an additional constant electric field. We describe the
photon-counting process under the condition that the polarization of the laser
coincides with the direction of the constant electric field. The theoretical
results are given for the example of $^4{He}^+$. We show that the emission
behavior depends sensitively on the Lamb shift (W.E. Lamb, R.C. Retherford,
Phys. Rev. 72, 241 (1947)) between the $2s_{1/2}$ and $2p_{1/2}$ energy levels.
A possibly realizable measurement of the mean duration of the dark periods
should give quantitative information about the above energy difference by using
the proposed photon-counting process.

and suggested that they have to be skew-symmetric, and satisfy Leibnitz rule
and the Fundamental Identity (FI, it is a generalization of the Jacobi
identity). If the n'th order Nambu brackets in dimension N is written in terms
of the Nambu tensor \eta, the FI implies two conditions on it, one algebraic
and one differential. The algebraic part of FI implies decomposability of \eta
and in this letter we show that the Nambu bracket can then be written in terms
of the usual totally antisymmetric n-dimensional tensor and n vector fields D.
Our main result is that the differential part of the FI is satisfied iff the
vector fields D commute. Examples are provided by integrable Hamiltonian
systems. It turns out that then the Nambu bracket itself guarantees that the
motions stays on the manifold defined by the constants of motion of the
integrable system, while the n-1 Nambu Hamiltonians determine the (possibly
non-integrable) motion on this manifold.
