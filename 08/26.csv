  publication in MN",,"10.1093/mnras/284.3.717",,"astro-ph",,"  The primary radiation generated in the central continuum-forming region of
Active Galactic Nuclei can be reprocessed by very dense, small-scale clouds
that are optically-thin to Thomson scattering. In spite of the extreme
conditions expected to prevail in this innermost, central environment, the
radiative clouds can survive and maintain cool temperatures relative to the
ambient emitting region by means of magnetic confinement. Motivated by these
ideas, we present a detailed quantitative study of such clouds, explicitly
describing the physical properties they can attain under thermal and radiative
equilibrium conditions. We also discuss the thermal stability of the gas in
comparison to that of other reprocessing material thought to reside at larger
distances from the central source. We construct a model to predict the emergent
spectra from a source region containing dense clouds which absorb and reemit
the primary radiation generated therein. Our predicted spectra show the
following two important results: (i) the reprocessed flux emitted at optical/UV
energies is insufficient to account for the blue bump component in the observed
spectra; and (ii) the amount of line radiation that is emitted is at least
comparable to (and in many cases dominates) the continuum radiation. The lines
are extremely broad and tend to accumulate in the extreme ultraviolet, where
they form a peak much more prominent than that which is observed in the
optical/UV. This result is supported by current observations, which indicate
that the spectral energy distribution of radio-quiet AGN may indeed reach a
maximum in the EUV band.

which the dark matter not only dominates the outer kinematics, but also plays a
major dynamical role in the inner galaxy: the Galactic disk is therefore said
to be ``sub-maximal.'' This conclusion is important to the understanding of the
evolution of galaxies and the viability of particular dark matter models. The
Galactic evidence rests on a number of structural and kinematic measurements,
many of which have recently been revised. The new constraints indicate not only
that the Galaxy is a more typical member of its class (Sb-Sc spirals) than
previously thought, but also require a re-examination of the question of
whether or not the Milky Way disk is maximal. By applying to the Milky Way the
same definition of ``maximal disk'' that is applied to external galaxies, it is
shown that the new observational constraints are consistent with a Galactic
maximal disk of reasonable $M/L$. In particular, the local disk column can be
substantially less than the oft-quoted required $\Sigma_{\odot} \approx 100
\msolar pc^{-2}$ - as low as $40 \msolar pc^{-2}$ in the extreme case - and
still be maximal, in the sense that the dark halo provides negligible rotation
support in the inner Galaxy. This result has possible implications for any
conclusion that rests on assumptions about the potentials of the Galactic disk
or dark halo, and in particular for the interpretation of microlensing results
along both LMC and bulge lines of sight.

been studied in considerable detail.
  In this review we will address the importance of the VLT for studies of
samples of distant radio galaxies. We shall first briefly discuss the
importance of radio galaxies for cosmological studies. Then we shall summarize
the various emitting components associated with these objects and comment on
the possibilities offered by the VLT for detailed observations of these
components and the radio/optical alignment effect. Next, the prospects for
detecting and studying galaxy clusters around high redshift radio galaxies are
briefly discussed. The case of 1138$-$262 ($z=2.15$) is discussed as an example
of a possible proto-galaxy that might be situated in a cluster-type of
environment. Finally, we outline some of the steps that should be taken to
optimize use of the VLT in this area.

been discussed in several recent papers. In the problems of mesoscopic
fluctuations and quantum chaos a comparison is often made with random matrix
theory. It turns out that, even in the simplest Gaussian unitary ensemble,
these oscilllations have not yet been studied there. For random matrices, the
two-level correlation function $\rho(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ exhibits several
well-known universal properties in the large N limit. Its Fourier transform is
linear as a consequence of the short distance universality of
$\rho(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$. However the cross-over near zero and $\tau_c$
requires to study these correlations for finite N. For this purpose we use an
exact contour-integral representation of the two-level correlation function
which allows us to characterize these cross-over oscillatory properties. The
