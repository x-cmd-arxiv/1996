  ApJ",,"10.1086/178179",,"astro-ph",,"  We present an observational analysis of numerical simulations of galaxy
cluster mergers. We identify several observational signatures of recent merger
activity, and quantitatively assess the uncertainty introduced into cluster
mass estimates when invoking the commonly held assumptions of hydrostatic
equilibrium, virial equilibrium, spherical symmetry and isothermality. We find
that mergers result in multiple X-ray peaks, long-lived elongation of the X-ray
emission as well as isophotal twisting and centroid shifting to a degree
consistent with recent observations. We also find an enlargement of the X-ray
core relative to the dark matter core. Mergers result in non-isothermal
clusters exhibiting observable inhomogeneities in the emission-weighted X-ray
temperature of several keV on linear scales of less than 0.5 Mpc. The resulting
gas dynamics are extremely complex, and we present an example of what might be
observed by a high resolution X-ray spectrograph. We further speculate that the
gas dynamics, via shocks, bulk flows and turbulence, play an important role in
the evolution of cluster galaxies and associated radio sources, particularly
wide-angle tailed (WAT) sources and radio halos. We find that X-ray based by
cluster mass estimates made under equilibrium assumptions can be uncertain 50\%
or more in the first 2 Gyrs after a merger and by up to 25\% after 2 Gyrs
depending on the details of the analysis and projection effects. Uncertainties
can be considerably larger if the temperature is not well constrained.

regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is sufficiently wide to permit the
existence of multiphase structure. In particular, very dense, cool clouds can
coexist with a hot, magnetically-dominated medium and can thereby efficiently
reprocess the continuum radiation generated in this primary source region. The
strong dynamical forces in this central magnetosphere can give rise to
extremely small clouds. Microphysical processes then determine whether such
clouds can indeed survive, in spite of their extremely contrasting properties
relative to the surrounding environment, for long enough to produce potentially
observable thermal reprocessing signatures. We examine specific physical
constraints on the thicknesses of such reprocessing clouds. Our results are
plotted to show the range of conditions that is representative of the central
regions of AGN. We find a parameter subspace in the extreme high density regime
for which the effects of microphysical diffusion processes can be overcome and
for which cool gas can maintain pressure equilibrium with the ambient

nonlinearly, with a light scalar meson included as a chiral singlet to describe
the mid-range nucleon-nucleon attraction. The low-energy electromagnetic
structure of the nucleon is described within the theory using vector-meson
dominance, so that external form factors are not needed. The effective
lagrangian is expanded in powers of the fields and their derivatives, with the

presented for finite nuclei and nuclear matter at one-baryon-loop order, using
the single-nucleon structure determined within the model. Parameters obtained
from fits to nuclear properties show that naive dimensional analysis is a
useful principle and that a truncation of the effective lagrangian at the first
few powers of the fields and their derivatives is justified.

modern potential. The main features of this model is that the scalar-isoscalar
component of the interaction is relatively small, due to cancellations between
large terms, and fails to reproduce the intermediate range attraction in the
central channel. We show that chiral symmetry is the responsible for these
large cancellations in the two-pion exchange nucleon-nucleon interaction, which
are similar to those occuring in free pion-nucleon scattering. Another feature
of the model is that these results do not depend on how chiral symmetry is
implemented.

yields the interpolating field which overlaps strongly with the negative-parity
baryon and at the same time does not couple at all to the low lying
positive-parity baryon. Using this interpolating field and applying the
conventional QCD sum rule analysis, we find that the mass of S$_{11}$ is
reasonably close to the experimentally known value, even though the precise
determination depends on the poorly known quark-gluon condensate. Hence our
interpolating field can be used to investigate the spectral properties of

numerically for several models of electron-optical phonon coupling. The
nonmagnetic in-plane impurity scattering suppresses T_{c} in all cases
considered, and it is possible to obtain a fair agreement with experiments for
a reasonable choice of parameters. For the anisotropic electron-phonon coupling
proposed by Song and Annett we find that the interlayer pair tunneling can
stabilize the d_{x^2-y^2}-wave superconducting state with a high T_{c}.
Moreover, in this case there is a possibility of an impurity induced crossover
from the d$_{x^2-y^2}$-wave state stabilized by the interlayer tunneling to the
s-wave state at a low impurity concentration. We also calculate the isotope
effect associated with the in-plane oxygen optic mode and its dependence on the
strength of the interlayer pair tunneling. Small positive values of the isotope
exponent are obtained for strengths of pair tunneling that give high transition
temperatures.
