monodromy homomorphism from a finitely generated free group to Artin's braid
group B_n. Using Hansen's polynomial covering space theory, we give a new
interpretation of this construction. Next, we provide an explicit description
of the braid monodromy of an arrangement of complex affine hyperplanes, by
means of an associated ``braided wiring diagram.'' The ensuing presentation of
the fundamental group of the complement is shown to be Tietze-I equivalent to
the Randell-Arvola presentation. Work of Libgober then implies that the
complement of a line arrangement is homotopy equivalent to the 2-complex
modeled on either of these presentations. Finally, we prove that the braid
monodromy of a line arrangement determines the intersection lattice. Examples
of Falk then show that the braid monodromy carries more information than the
group of the complement, thereby answering a question of Libgober.

which the IGM is reionized by discrete sources of photoionizing radiation, the
neutral gas which has not yet been engulfed by an H II region may easily be
preheated to temperatures well above that of the cosmic background radiation
(CBR), rendering the IGM invisible in absorption against the CBR. We identify
three possible preheating mechanisms: (1) photoelectric heating by soft X-rays
from QSOs, (2) photoelectric heating by soft X-rays from early galactic halos,
and (3) resonant scattering of the continuum UV radiation from an early
generation of stars. In the presence of a sufficiently strong ambient flux of
Lyman-alpha photons, the hyperfine transition in the warmed H I will be
excited. A beam differencing experiment would detect a patchwork of emission,
both in frequency and in angle across the sky. This patchwork could serve as a
valuable tool for understanding the epoch, nature, and sources of the
reionization of the universe, and their implications for cosmology. We
demonstrate that isolated QSOs will produce detectable signals at meter
wavelengths within their ``spheres of influence'' over which they warm the IGM.
As a result of the redshifted 21-cm radiation emitted by warm H I bubbles, the
spectrum of the radio extragalactic background will display frequency structure
with velocity widths up to 10,000 km/s. Broad beam observations would reveal
corresponding angular fluctuations in the sky intensity with (delta T/T)=1E-3
on degree-scales. Radio measurements near 235 and 150 MHz, as will be possible
in the near future using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, may provide the

the $1D$ Luttinger liquid. Moderate intra-chain interactions can lead to a
strong reduction of this splitting. The on-set of the confinement within the

$\alpha$. We give numerical evidence that inter-chain coherent hopping can be
totally suppressed for $\alpha\sim 0.4$ or even smaller $\alpha$ values. The
transverse conductivty is shown to exhibit a strong incoherent part. Even when
coherent inter-chain hopping is believed to occur (at small $\alpha$ values),

different chiral structure as well as FCNC. The constraints has been extracted
from the experimental results of B meson decays, the $T_{new}$ parameter of
oblique corrections and $R_b$. Under the natural assumption that the violation
of the $V-A$ structure in the light-quark sector is small, we can determine the
allowed region for most of the mixings parameters and the vector-like quark

A","Nucl.Phys. A608 (1996) 202-226","10.1016/0375-9474(96)00273-4",,"nucl-th",,"  We have carried out a study of superheavy nuclei in the framework of the
Relativistic Mean-Field theory. Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB)
calculations have been performed for nuclei with large proton and neutron
numbers. A finite-range pairing force of Gogny type has been used in the RHB
calculations. The ground-state properties of very heavy nuclei with atomic
numbers Z=100-114 and neutron numbers N=154-190 have been obtained. The results
show that in addition to N=184 the neutron numbers N=160 and N=166 exhibit an
extra stability as compared to their neighbors. For the case of protons the
atomic number Z=106 is shown to demonstrate a closed-shell behavior in the
region of well deformed nuclei about N=160. The proton number Z=114 also
indicates a shell closure. Indications for a doubly magic character at Z=106
and N=160 are observed. Implications of shell closures on a possible synthesis
of superheavy nuclei are discussed.

surface waves for fluids of low viscosity, and in the limit of large aspect
ratio. The analysis is based on a quasi-potential approximation to the
equations governing fluid motion, followed by a multiscale asymptotic expansion
in the distance away from threshold. Close to onset, the asymptotic expansion
yields an amplitude equation which is of gradient form, and allows the explicit
calculation of the functional form of the cubic nonlinearities. In particular,
we find that three-wave resonant interactions contribute significantly to the
nonlinear terms, and therefore are important for pattern selection.
Minimization of the associated Lyapunov functional predicts a primary
bifurcation to a standing wave pattern of square symmetry for
capillary-dominated surface waves, in agreement with experiments. In addition,
we find that patterns of hexagonal and quasi-crystalline symmetry can be
stabilized in certain mixed capillary-gravity waves, even in this case of
single frequency forcing. Quasi-crystalline patterns are predicted in a region
of parameters readily accessible experimentally.
