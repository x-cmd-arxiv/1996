distribution of the lens is known. Currently, the double QSO 0957+561 is the
only lensed object with a precisely known time delay. The largest remaining
source of systematic error in the H$_0$ determination results from uncertainty
in the mass distribution of the lens which is comprised of a massive galaxy
(G1) and the cluster in which it resides.
  We have obtained V-band CCD images from CFHT in order to measure the mass
distribution in the cluster from its gravitional distorting effect on the
appearance of background galaxes. We use this data to constuct a
two-dimensional mass map of the field. A mass peak is detected at the
$4.5\sigma$ level, offset from, but consistent with, the position of G1. Simple
tests reveal no significant substructure and the mass distribution is
consistent with a spherical cluster. The peak in the number density map of
bright galaxies is offset from G1 similarly to the mass peak.
  We constructed an azimuthally averaged mass profile centered on G1 out to 2
\arcmin ($400 h^{-1}$ kpc). It is consistent with an isothermal mass
distribution with a small core ($r_c \approx 5 \arcsec = 17 h^{-1}$ kpc). The
inferred mass within 1 Mpc is consistent with the dynamical mass estimate but
$2\sigma$ higher than the upper limits from a ROSAT X-ray study.

emission from A2626 suggests a relaxed, single-component system; however, 159
redshifts reveals a complex, three component cluster at cz~17,500km/s. One
components is a typical X-ray bright cluster, a second has a cluster-like
galaxy population with lower central galaxy and gas density, and the third is a
background structure with field galaxy composition. A comparison of the
magnitude distributions within the two subclusters suggests that A2626 is a
merger in progress. Virial masses and a composite luminosity function for a
region with projected radius r=1.5h^{-1}Mpc yield a mass to light ratio
M/L_R~610h. Analysis of the X-ray emission from the primary component yields a
gas mass fraction of 2.2h^{-3/2}% and a baryon fraction of 3.4%. A radial
infall model implies that the virial mass may be an underestimate. In A2440,
deep CCD $R$ band photometry indicates a striking correspondence between the
galaxy and gas distributions. The galaxy distribution has three main
components, each associated with a giant elliptical galaxy. The two larger
peaks in the galaxy distribution coincide with the primary peaks in the X-ray

optically identified with a 19th mag star. Of the six known Z-sources, only two
(Sco X-1 and Cyg X-2) have been studied in the optical. It has been suggested
that Z-sources as a group are characterized by evolved companions and
correspondingly long orbital periods (Sco X-1, P=0.8 d; Cyg X-2, P=9.8 d).
Recently Southwell et al. (1996) have presented spectroscopic observations of
GX 349+2 suggesting a 14 d orbital period. We have obtained broadband
photometry of the system on six consecutive nights, and find a statistically
significant 21.85 +/- 0.4 h (3 sigma) period of 0.14 mag half-amplitude,
superposed on erratic flickering typical of Sco X-1 type objects. As with other
Z-sources, caution will be needed to insure that the variations are truly
periodic, and not simply due to chaotic variability observed over a relatively
short time span. Depending on the origin of the brightness variations, our
proposed period could be either the orbital or half the orbital period. If our
period is confirmed, then the nature of the 14 d spectroscopic variation found
by Southwell et al. (1996) is unclear. There is evidence that the mass function
of GX 349+2 is similar to that of Sco X-1.

the power spectra of cold dark matter plus $\Lambda$ models have approximately
the right shape, the COBE-normalized amplitude for a scale invariant spectrum
is too high, requiring galaxies to be anti-biased relative to the mass
distribution. Attempts to address the first problem have led to models in which
a dynamical field supplies the vacuum energy, which is thereby determined by
fundamental physics scales. We explore the implications of such dynamical
$\Lambda$ models for the formation of large-scale structure. We find that there
are dynamical models for which the amplitude of the COBE-normalized spectrum

arbitrary mass, electric, and magnetic currents (Dirac's monopole) coexist
within this theory. Assuming that the space-time is torsionless, taking the
photons mass zero, and turning to the Einstein gauge we obtain Maxwell's

spectral weight, and then a perturbation method in field theory models, in
order to approximately describe the environment. All of these approximate
models may be classified as extended Ohmic models of dissipation whose

  The quantum system we deal with in the present work is a general class of

behavior of the system is well described by an approximation that employs a
localized friction in the dissipative part of the correlation function
appearing in the influence functional. The density matrix of the quantum system
is then determined in terms of a single classical solution obtained with the
time dependent frequency. With this one can compute the entropy, the energy
distribution function, and other physical quantities of the system in a closed

  Specific application is made to the case of periodically varying frequency.
This dynamical system has a remarkable property when the environmental
interaction is switched off: Effect of the parametric resonance gives rise to
an exponential growth of the populated number in higher excitation levels, or

Schwinger-Dyson equation for the gauged Thirring model which has been proposed
recently by the author. The gauged Thirring model is a natural gauge-invariant
extension of the Thirring model and reduces to the Schwinger model (in the
Abelian case) in the strong four-fermion coupling limit. The exact SD equation
is derived by making use of the transverse Ward-Takahashi identity as well as
the usual (longitudinal) Ward-Takahashi identity. Moreover the exact solution
of the SD equation for the fermion propagator is obtained together with the
vertex function in the Abelian gauged case. Finally we discuss the dynamical
fermion mass generation based on the solution of the SD equation.

  Conference",,,,"hep-th",,"  It is pointed out that any conformally transformed of a flat space-time
metric $\ball g_{ij} = f(x)\;\eta_{ij}$ is a solution to Witten's equation of
Chern-Simons gravity, which holds outside matter in (2+1) dimensions. It is
also shown that a simultaneous exterior solution to both Witten's and
Einstein's equations, yields the lensing effect of an isolated cosmic string,
if $f(x)$ is reduced to an arbitrary dimensionless constant. However, the
solution to Witten's equation with $f(x)$ being an arbitrary and continuous
function of space-time coordinates, also leads to an open circular path for a
light ray near the string.

in the fire-cylinder are determined by following the general features of the
results from microscopic models based on the string dynamics and further
requiring that the final proton and pion spectra and rapidity distributions are
in agreement with available experimental data. For dilepton production, we
include the Dalitz decay of $\pi ^0$, $\eta$, $\eta^\prime$, $\omega$ and $a_1$
mesons, the direct decay of primary $\rho ^0$, $\omega$ and $\phi$ mesons, and
the pion-pion annihilation that proceeds through the $\rho^0$ meson, the
pion-rho annihilation that proceeds through the $a_1$ meson, and the
kaon-antikaon annihilation that proceeds through the $\phi$ meson. We find that
the modification of vector meson properties, especially the decrease of their
mass due to the partial restoration of chiral symmetry, in hot and dense
hadronic matter, provides a quantitative explanation of the recently observed
enhancement of low-mass dileptons by the CERES collaboration in central S+Au
collisions and by the HELIOS-3 collaboration in central S+W collisions.

  Rev. E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.55.1463",,"patt-sol chao-dyn nlin.CD nlin.PS",,"  The universal equations describing collective oscillations of the multidomain
patterns of small period in an arbitrary $d$-dimensional reaction-diffusion
system of the activator-inhibitor type are asymptotically derived. It is shown
that not far from the instability leading to the formation of the pulsating
multidomain pattern the oscillations of different domains synchronize. In one
dimension standing and traveling waves of the oscillation phase are realized.
In addition to these, in two dimensions target and spiral waves of the
oscillation phase, as well as spatio-temporal chaos of domain oscillations, are
feasible. Further inside the unstable region the collective oscillations break
down, so the pulsating multidomain pattern transforms into an irregular
pulsating pattern, the uniform self-oscillations, or turbulence. The parameter
regions where these effects occur are analyzed. The effects of the pattern's
disorder are also studied. The conclusions of the analysis are supported by the
numerical simulations of a concrete model. The obtained results explain the
dynamics of Turing patterns observed in the experiments on
chlorite-iodide-malonic acid reaction.

through the use of quantum error correction methods, correlations can be

cannot increase correlations, and also derive general conditions for quantum
error correcting codes. Using these we show that local quantum error correction
can preserve nonlocal features of entangled quantum systems. We also
demonstrate these results by use of specific examples employing correlated
optical cavities interacting locally with resonant atoms. By way of counter
example, we also describe a mechanism by which correlations can be increased,
