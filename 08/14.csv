accretes onto high density peaks. Accreting collisionless dark matter (DM)
forms caustics around them, while accreting collisional baryonic matter (BM)
forms accretion shocks. The properties of the accreting matter depend upon the
power spectrum of the initial perturbations on a given scale as well as the
background expansion in a given cosmological model. In this paper, we have
calculated the accretion of DM particles in one-dimensional spherical geometry
under various cosmological models including the Einstein-de Sitter universe,
the open universe with $\Omega_o<1$, and the flat universe with
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=1-\Omega_o$. A density parameter in the range $0.1\le
\Omega_o \le 1$ has been considered. The initial perturbation characterized by
a point mass at the origin has been considered. Since the accretion shock of BM
is expected to form close to the first caustic of DM, the properties of the
accreting BM are common with those of the DM. Hence, the accretion calculations
with DM particles have been used to find the position and velocity of the
accretion shock and the cluster mass inside it. The average temperature of BM
has been estimated by adopting simplifying assumptions. The velocity of the
accreting BM around clusters of a given temperature is smaller in a universe
with smaller $\Omega_o$, but only by up to $\sim24\%$ in the models with
$0.1\le \Omega_o \le 1$. Thus, it would be difficult to use that quantity to
discriminate among the cosmological models. However, the accretion velocity
around clusters of a given mass or a given radius depends more sensitively on
the cosmological models. It is smaller in a universe with smaller $\Omega_o$ by
up to $\sim41\%$ and $\sim65\%$, respectively. So, it can provide a better

clusters. We use the observed temperature distribution of local clusters and
assume a simple power-law evolutionary model for the comoving density of the
clusters. The shock parameters such as the shock radius and velocity are
deduced from the ICM temperature using the self-similar solutions for secondary
infall onto the clusters. The magnetic field strength is assume to be in
equipartition with the postshock thermal energy behind the accretion shock. We
also assume that the injected energy spectrum is a power-law with the
exponential cutoff at the maximum energy which is calculated from the condition
that the energy gain rate for diffusive shock acceleration is balanced by the
loss rate due to the interactions with the cosmic background radiation. In
contrast to the earlier paper we have adopted here the description of the
cosmic ray diffusion by Jokipii (1987) which leads to considerably higher
particle energies. Finally the injected particle spectrum at the clusters is
integrated over the cosmological distance to earth by considering the energy
loss due to the interactions with the cosmic background radiation. Our
calculations show that the expected spectrum of high-energy protons from the
cosmological ensemble of the cluster accretion shocks could match well the
observed cosmic ray spectrum near $10^{19}$eV with reasonable parameters and
models if about $10^{-4}$ of the infalling kinetic energy can be injected into
the intergalactic space as the high energy particles.

spiral galaxies in terms of the azimuthal m=1 Fourier amplitude, A_1, of the
stellar light. We conjecture that this lopsidedness is caused by tidal
interactions and calculate an UPPER limit on the accretion rate of small
galaxies. We exploit the correlation between lopsidedness and photometric
measures of recent star formation (Zaritsky 1995) to obtain two independent
estimates of the lifetime of these m=1 distortions. First, we show that
lopsided galaxies have an excess of blue luminosity relative to that of
symmetric galaxies with the same H I linewidth, which we attribute to a recent
star formation episode that was triggered by an interaction between the galaxy
and a companion. We use stellar populations models (Bruzual and Charlot 1993)
to estimate the time since that interaction. Second, we use the N-body
simulation of an infalling satellite by Walker, Mihos, and Hernquist (1996) to
estimate how fast tidally induced m=1 distortions are erased through phase
mixing. Both approaches indicate that the observations are consistent with a
hypothesized tidal interaction that occurred about 1 Gyr ago for galaxies that
are lopsided at the 20% level. By combining this lifetime estimate for
lopsidedness, the observed frequency of such distortions, and a correction to
the survey volume that depends on the increase in luminosity during an
interaction, we derive an upper limit on the current companion accretion rate
of field spiral galaxies (for companion masses of about 10% parent galaxy mass)
that lies in the range 0.07 - 0.25 per Gyr. The principal uncertainty in this
limit arises from ambiguities in the interpretation of the correlation between

published spectra we analyze data for a sample of 18 objects.
  In 11 of the 18 radio galaxies we find deep troughs in the Ly$\alpha$
emission profile, which we interpret as H\,{\sc i} absorption with column
densities in the range $10^{18}$--$10^{19.5}$ cm$^{-2}$. Since in most cases
the Ly$\alpha$ emission is absorbed over its entire spatial extent (up to 50
kpc), the absorbers must have a covering fraction close to unity. Under
plausible assumptions for the temperature and density of the absorbing gas this
implies that the absorbing material must consist of $\sim 10^{12}$ clouds of
typical size $\sim 0.03$ pc with a total mass of $\sim 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$.
  Our observations show that strong H\,{\sc i} absorption occurs in $>60$\% of
the high redshift radio galaxies, while from the statistics of quasar
absorption lines there is only a 2\% probability of such a strong H\,{\sc i}
absorption line falling by chance in the small redshift interval of the
Ly$\alpha$ emission line. These absorbers are therefore most likely to be
physically associated with the galaxy hosting the radio source or its direct
environment.
  There are strong correlations between the properties of the Ly$\alpha$
emission of the galaxies and the size of the associated radio source: (i) Of
the smaller ($<50$ kpc) radio galaxies 9 out of 10 have strong associated
H\,{\sc i} absorption, whereas only 2 of the 8 larger ($>50$ kpc) radio
galaxies show such strong absorption. (ii) Larger radio sources tend to have
larger Ly$\alpha$ emission regions and (iii) a smaller Ly$\alpha$ velocity

two-mode field states which are intelligent states for Hermitian generators of
the SU(2) and SU(1,1) groups, respectively. Intelligent states minimize
uncertainty relations and this makes possible an essential reduction of the
quantum noise in interferometers. Exact closed expressions for the minimum
detectable phase shift are obtained in terms of the Jacobi polynomials. These
expressions are compared with results for some conventional input states, and
some known results for the squeezed input states are reviewed. It is shown that
the phase sensitivity for an interferometer that employs squeezing-producing
active devices (such as four-wave mixers) should be analyzed in two regimes:
(i) fixed input state and variable interferometer, and (ii) fixed
interferometer and variable input state. The behavior of the phase sensitivity
is essentially different in these two regimes. The use of the SU(2) intelligent
states allows us to achieve a phase sensitivity of order $1/\bar{N}$ (where
$\bar{N}$ is the total number of photons passing through the phase shifters of
the interferometer) without adding four-wave mixers. This avoids the duality in
the behavior of the phase sensitivity that occurs for the squeezed input. On
the other hand, the SU(1,1) intelligent states have the property of achieving
the phase sensitivity of order $1/\bar{N}$ in both regimes.

systems governed by a trilinear boson Hamiltonian. These states are produced by
the action of a nonunitary displacement operator on a reference state and can
be equivalently defined by some eigenvalue equations. The system prepared
initially in the reference state will evolve into the coherent state during the
first instants of the interaction process. Some properties of the coherent
states are discussed. In particular, the resolution of the identity is derived
and the related analytic representation in the complex plane is developed. It
is shown that this analytic representation coincides with a double
representation based on the Glauber coherent states of the pump mode and on the
SU(1,1) Perelomov coherent states of the signal-idler system. Entanglement
between the field modes and photon statistics of the coherent states are
studied. Connections between the coherent states and the long-time evolution
induced by the trilinear Hamiltonian are considered.
