singularities. Let $\omega$ be a holomorphic form on $M\setminus K$ with the
first order pole on K. The Leray residue of such form gives an element in the
n-th homology of K which is the Alexander dual to $[\omega ]\in
H^{n+1}(M\setminus K)$. It always lifts to the intersection homology if 0 does
not belong to the spectra of a singular points. We assume that singularities
are described by the quasihomogeneous equations in certain coordinate systems.
Suppose that oscillation indicators of the singular points are greater then -1.
Then we find a metric on $K\setminus\Sigma$ in which the residue form is square
integrable (and even L_p-integrable for p>2). Applying the isomorphism of
L_p-cohomology and intersection homology we obtain a particular lift of the
residue class in homology to intersection homology.

photodissociation of H2+, and photodissociation of H2. Further it was found
that the molecular hydrogen produced through the gas-phase processes, H2+ + H
-> H2 + H+, and H- + H -> H2 + e-, is likely to be converted into its para
configuration on a faster time scale than the formation time scale. We have
tested the model extensively and shown it to agree well with former studies. We
further studied the chemical kinetics in great detail and devised a minimal
model which is substantially simpler than the full reaction network but
predicts correct abundances. This minimal model shows convincingly that 12
collisional processes are sufficient to model the H, He, H+, H-, He+, He++, and

recombination of ionized matter subsequent to redshift z=1200, followed by
reionization prior to redshift z=5 and compute how this would have occurred in
a standard scenario for the growth of structure. Extending prior semi-analytic
work, we show by direct, high-resolution numerical simulations (of a COBE
normalized CDM+Lambda model) that reheating, will occur in the interval 15>z>7,
followed by reionization and accompanied by a significant increase in the Jeans
mass. However, the evolution of the Jeans mass does not significantly affect
star formation in dense, self-shielded clumps of gas, which are detached from
the thermal evolution of the rest of the universe. On average, the growth of
the Jeans mass tracks the growth of the nonlinear mass scale, a result we
suspect is due to nonlinear feedback effects. Cooling on molecular hydrogen
leads to a burst of star formation prior to reheating which produces Population
III stars with Omega_* reaching 10^{-5.5} and Z/Z_sun reaching 10^{-3.7} by
z=14. Star formation subsequently slows down as molecular hydrogen is depleted
by photo-destruction and the rise of the temperature. At later times, z<10,
when the characteristic virial temperature of gas clumps reach 10,000 degrees,
star formation increases again as hydrogen line cooling become efficient.
Objects containing Pop III stars accrete mass with time and, as soon as they
reach 10,000 K virial temperature, they engage in renewed star formation and
turn into normal Pop II objects having an old Pop III metal poor component.

proportional to the optical depth. For standard scenarios the rms degree of
linear polarization as measured with a 7 degree FWHM antenna (like the one of
the Brown University experiment) is $1.6\mu K$, $1.2 \mu K$, $4.8\times 10^{-2}

Markarian 421, has been observed also at GeV energies and has roughly equal
luminosity per decade at GeV and TeV energies. Photon-photon pair production on
the infrared background radiation is expected to prevent observation above
about 1 TeV. However, the infrared background is not well known and it may be
possible to observe the nearest blazars up to energies somewhat below about 100
TeV where absorption on the cosmic microwave background will give a sharp
cut-off.
  Blazars are commonly believed to correspond to low power radio galaxies, seen
down along a relativistic jet; as such they are all expected to have the
nuclear activity encircled by a dusty molecular torus, which subtends an angle
of 90 degrees or more in width as seen from the central source. Photon-photon
pair production can also take place on the infrared radiation produced at the
AGN by this molecular torus and surrounding outer disk. We calculate the
optical depth for escaping gamma-rays produced near the central black hole and
at various points along the jet axis for the case of blazars where the
radiation is observed in a direction closely aligned with the jet.
  We find that the TeV emission site must be well above the top of the torus.
For example, if the torus has an inner radius of 0.1 pc and an outer radius of
0.2 pc, then the emission site in Mrk 421 would have be at least 0.25 pc above
the upper surface of the torus, and if Mrk 421 is observed above 50 TeV in the
future, the emission site would have to be at least 0.5 pc above the upper
surface. This has important implications for models of gamma-ray emission in
active galactic nuclei.

lead to a vanishing of $\delta m^2$, giving rise to MSW-like effects. We

expansion for the pion intracting gas. It is shown that in this picture the
deconfinement phase transition is absent, in agreement with lattice gauge
calculations which show the only phase transition of chiral symmetry
restoration. The latter is modelled with the help of the restriction of the
number of the effective degrees of freedom in the hadron phase to that of the
microscopic degrees of freedom in the quark-gluon phase, through the
corresponding truncation of the hadronic resonance spectrum, and the decrease
of the effective hadron masses with temperature, predicted by Brown and Rho.

crossover in the thermodynamic variables in a temperature range $\sim 50$ MeV.
