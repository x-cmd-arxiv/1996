associated, by geostrophy, with changes in the east-west pressure difference
across an ocean basin. The tropical-polar density contrast and the east-west
pressure difference are connected by an adjustment process. In flat-bottomed
ocean models the adjustment is associated with viscous, baroclinic Kelvin wave
propagation. Weak-high latitude stratification leads to the adjustment having
an interdecadal timescale. We reexamine model interdecadal oscillations in the
context of the adjustment process, for both constant flux and mixed surface
boundary conditions. Under constant surface flux, interdecadal oscillations are
associated with the passage of a viscous Kelvin wave around the model domain.
Our results suggest the oscillations can be self-sustained by perturbations to
the western boundary current arising from the southward boundary wave
propagation. Mixed boundary condition oscillations are characterized by the
eastward, cross-basin movement of salinity-dominated density anomalies, and the
westward return of these anomalies along the northern boundary. We suggest the
latter is associated with viscous Kelvin wave propagation. Under both types of
boundary conditions, the strength of the thermohaline overturning and the
tropical-polar density contrast vary out of phase. We show how the phase
relationship is related to the boundary wave propagation. The importance of
boundary regions indicates an urgent need to examine the robustness of
interdecadal variability in models as the resolution is increased, and as the
representation of the coastal, shelf/slope wave guide is improved. (Abriged

705,679 stars within $-18^{\circ} \le \delta \le 90^{\circ}$ has been produced.
The sky coverage of the TAC is complete to over 90\% in that area. The limiting
magnitude is about B=11.5. Positions are based on $4912$ plates taken with the
U.S. Naval Observatory Twin Astrograph (blue, yellow lens) at epochs
1977--1986. The TAC is supplemented by proper motions which are obtained from a
combination with a re--reduced Astrographic Catalog (AC). Some AC zones are
available now and a complete northern hemisphere is expected by fall 1996.
Proper motions of almost all TAC stars will be generated as the AC work
progresses. The average precision of a catalog position is 90 mas per
coordinate at epoch of observation. A large fraction of that error is
introduced by the currently available reference stars. The inherent precision
of the TAC data is considerably better. The precision of the proper motions is
currently 2.5 to 4 mas/yr. Magnitude--dependent systematic errors have been
found and preliminarily corrected. The final reduction of this plate material
will be performed with the Hipparcos catalog in 1997. The TAC is about 3 times
more precise than the PPM or ACRS in the northern hemisphere at current epochs
and contains about 3 times more stars. The TAC has a higher star density than
the Tycho catalog and provides independent, high precision positions for a
large fraction of the Tycho stars at an epoch about 10 years earlier than the
Tycho mean epoch. The TAC version 1.0 data are released as the AC zones become
available. For latest information, look at the US Naval Observatory World Wide

0.742 < P_1/P_0 < 0.748. A significant fraction of our current sample have

  Adopting this luminosity calibration, we derive an increase in the distance

about 33% and discuss the implications for cosmology.

equations extended by Lorentz for a single charge system are discussed. To
surmount these in framework of Maxwellian theory, a novel convection
displacement current is considered as additional and complementary to the
famous Maxwell displacement current. It is shown that this form of the
Maxwell-Lorentz equations is similar to that proposed by Hertz for
electrodynamics of bodies in motion. Original Maxwell's equations can be
considered as a valid approximation for a continuous and closed (or going to
infinity) conduction current. It is also proved that our novel form of the
Maxwell-Lorentz equations is relativistically invariant. In particular, a
relativistically invariant gauge for quasistatic fields has been found to
replace the non-invariant Coulomb gauge. The new gauge condition contains the
famous relationship between electric and magnetic potentials for one uniformly
moving charge that is usually attributed to the Lorentz transformations. Thus,
for the first time, using the convection displacement current, a physical
interpretation is given to the relationship between the components of the
four-vector of quasistatic potentials. A rigorous application of the new gauge
transformation with the Lorentz gauge transforms the basic field equations into
an independent pair of differential equations responsible for longitudinal and
transverse fields, respectively. The longitudinal components can be interpreted
exclusively from the standpoint of the instantaneous ""action at a distance""
concept and leads to necessary conceptual revision of the conventional
Faraday-Maxwell field. The concept of electrodynamic dualism is proposed for
self-consistent classical electrodynamics. It implies simultaneous coexistence

introduces a further approximation that avoids what has hitherto been the most
time-consuming feature of the full theory, and that this approximation can be
introduced either in the intrinsic system, the usual case, or in the laboratory
system, our preference. A new algorithm is described for the full theory that
largely removes the difference in complexity between the two types of
calculation. Comparison of the full and approximate theories for some
representative cases provides a basis for the assessment of the accuracy of the
traditional approach. We find that for well-deformed nuclei, e.g. 157Gd and
