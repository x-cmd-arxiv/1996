We then consider the example of mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau threefolds of
the type considered by Voisin and Borcea, of the form SxE/involution where S is
a K3 surface with involution, and E is an elliptic curve. We show how dualizing
a family of special Lagrangian real 3-tori does actually produce the mirrors in
these examples.

available in literature show that for -2.7 < [Fe/H] < -0.8 Be correlates
linearly with iron [Be] proportional to 1.07(+/- 0.08)[Fe/H], giving strength
to previous results. However, a steeper correlation is still possible at
metallicities lower than [Fe/H]<-1.4 with [Be] proportional to 1.6(+/-

oxygen up to solar values, without signs of breaking in correspondence of the
onset of the Galactic disk. No evidence of intrinsic dispersion is found, ought
to the large errors involved in the Be abundance determinations, but for three
stars (HD 106516, HD 3795, HD 211998) a significant upper limit in the Be
abundance can be placed at about 1 dex below the mean trend of the Be-Fe
relation. For such stars non conventional mixing is required to explain Be
depletion. Be observations can be used to discriminate strongly Li-depleted
stars. These are the stars which show less Li than that expected by high energy
cosmic rays production as deduced from Be observations. The available Be
observations imply that some of the stars which contribute to the scatter in

nature of the Ly-alpha forest and metal absorption lines. It is shown that
current simulations can qualitatively account for many observed features of
galaxies. However, the objects which form in these simulations suffer from a
strong overcooling problem. Star formation and feedback processes are likely to
be indispensable ingredients for a realistic description even of the most basic
parameters of a galaxy. The progenitors of todays galaxies are expected to be
highly irregular and concentrated, as supported by recent observations. Though
they exhibit a velocity dispersion similar to present day L > L^* galaxies,
they may be much less massive. The filamentary distribution of the gas provides
a natural explanation for Ly-alpha and metal absorption systems. Furthermore,
numerical simulations can be used to avoid misinterpretations of observed data
and are able to alleviate some apparent contradictions in the size estimates of
Ly-alpha absorption systems.

all cases the anomalies would be removed if much of the light observed from the
ground in fact came from a nearby, thus-far-unresolved superposed companion.
For V1727 Cyg (X2129+470), we find no such companion. We also present an HST
FOS spectrum and broadband photometry which is consistent with a single, normal
star. The supersoft LMC X-ray source CAL 87 was already known from ground-based
work to have a companion separated by 0.9'' from the optical counterpart; our
HST images clearly resolve these objects, and yield the discovery of an even
closer, somewhat fainter additional companion. Our photometry indicates that
contamination is not severe outside eclipse, where the companions only
contribute 20% of the light in V, but during eclipse more than half of the V
light comes from the companions. The previously-determined spectral type of the
CAL 87 secondary may need to be reevaluated due to this significant
contamination, with consequences on inferences of the mass of the components.
We find no companions to NP Ser (=X1813-14, =GX17+2). However, for this object
we point out a small but possibly significant astrometric discrepancy between
the position of the optical object and that of the radio source which is the

interaction which is responsible for the quark flavor dynamics at intermediate
energies. In addition to the usual ultraviolet cut-off which is necessary since
the model is non-renormalizable, we also introduce an infrared cut-off which
drops off the unknown confinement part of the quark interaction, which is
believed to be less important for the flavor dynamics. The infrared cut-off
eliminates all q-qbar thresholds, which plague the application of the usual NJL
model beyond low-energy pion physics. We apply this two-cut-off prescription to
the extended NJL model with chiral and heavy quark symmetries proposed recently
by us. We find a satisfactoring description even of the heavy mesons with
spin/parity J/P = (0+, 1+). Furthermore, the shape-parameters of the Isgur-Wise
function are studied as a function of the residual heavy meson mass.

demonstration of the phenomenon are discussed and a novelty brought by the
