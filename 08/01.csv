the `dilaton' field possesses a potential. It has the unusual feature that in
the presence of a false vacuum there is a {\em stable} static solution with the
dilaton field displaced from the minimum of its potential, giving perfect de
Sitter expansion. We demonstrate how this solution can be used to implement the
open inflationary universe scenario. The necessary second phase of inflation
after false vacuum decay by bubble nucleation is driven by the dilaton rolling
from the static point to the minimum of its potential. Because the static
solution is stable whilst the false vacuum persists, the required evolution
occurs for a wide range of initial conditions. As the exterior of the bubble is
perfect de Sitter space, there is no problem with fields rolling outside the
bubble, as in one of the related models considered by Linde and Mezhlumian, and
the expansion rates before and after tunnelling may be similar which prevents
problematic high-amplitude super-curvature modes from being generated. Once
normalized to the microwave background anisotropies seen by the COBE satellite,
the viable models form a one-parameter family for each possible $\Omega_0$.

not concentrated in the directions of nearby external galaxies. For halo models
of the BATSE bursts with radii of 150 kpc or greater, we would expect to see
several burst events in observations pointed towards nearby galaxies. We see
none. We therefore conclude that if the Ginga detections are representative of
the population of GRBs sampled by BATSE, GRBs cannot originate in a Galactic
halo population with limiting radii between 150 kpc and 400 kpc. Inasmuch as
halos with limiting radii outside of this range have been excluded by the BATSE
isotropy measurements, our result indicates that all halo models are excluded.
This result is independent of whether the flashes we do detect have an

  Accepted in ApJ",,"10.1086/303432",,"astro-ph",,"  We present results from a statistical study of clouds in two-dimensional
numerical simulations of the interstellar medium. The clouds in the simulations
exhibit a differential mass spectrum $dN(M)/dM \sim M^{-1.44 \pm 0.1}$ and a
velocity dispersion-size relation $\Delta v \sim R^{0.41 \pm 0.08}$. However,
the clouds do {\it not} exhibit a clear density-size relation. At a given mean
density, clouds span a range of sizes from the smallest resolved scales up to a
maximum given by a Larson-type relation $R_{\rm max} \sim \rho^\alpha$, with
$\alpha = -0.81 \pm .15$, although numerical effects cannot be ruled out as
responsible for the latter correlation. Clouds span a range of column densities
$N$ of two orders of magnitude, supporting the suggestion that the
observational density-size relation may be an artifact of survey limitations.
In this case, the $\Delta v$--$R$ relation can be interpreted as a direct
consequence of a $k^{-2}$ turbulent spectrum, characteristic of a field of
shocks, verified in the simulations, rather than of virial equilibrium of
clouds with a $\rho \propto R^{-1}$ law. However, we also discuss the
possibility that the clouds are in balance between self-gravity and turbulence,
but with a scatter of at least a factor of 10 in the $Delta v$--$R$ relation,
and of 100 in the density-size relation, according to the equilibrium relation
$\Delta v \sim (NR)^{1/2}$. Finally, we compare these results with
observational data. We propose a simple model suggesting that recent results
finding nearly constant column densities for dark IRAS clouds may be an
artifact of a temperature gradient within the clouds induced by external
radiative heating. As a consequence, we emphasize that IRAS surface brightness
maps are not appropriate for measuring column densities.

morphological segregation coupled with differences in morphological mix. We
split ORS into morphological subsamples and confirm the existence of
morphological segregation of galaxies out to scales of $s \sim 10 h^{-1}$ Mpc.

The observed, essentially constant, Be/Fe ratio as a function of $Z/Z_\odot$
can be best understood if the metallicity of the accelerated particles (high
energy or low energy) does not vary much with $Z/Z_\odot$. This could be
achieved if the particles are accelerated directly from the ejecta of Type II

Be/Fe and the fact that most of the Fe at low $Z/Z_\odot$ is from SNII, we
derive the energy content in accelerated particles per SNII (a few times
10$^{50}$ erg). We show that additional $^{11}$B production by neutrinos is
consistent with the available data, allowing a neutrino yield from SNII less
than or equal to the nominal published yields. We further show that the
observed $^6$Li at low $Z/Z_\odot$ suggests that the accelerated particles
responsible for the LiBeB at such $Z/Z_\odot$ are confined to low energies and

function of various classes of objects can be related to theoretical
predictions. This relation involves first a calculation of the redshift
evolution of the underlying matter correlations. The next step is to relate
fluctuations in mass to those of any particular class of cosmic objects; in
general terms, this means a model for the bias and how it evolves with cosmic
epoch. Only after these two effects have been quantified can one perform an
appropriate convolution of the non-linearly evolved two-point correlation
function of the objects with their redshift distribution to obtain the
`observed' correlation function for a given sample. This convolution in itself
tends to mask the effect of evolution by mixing amplitudes at different
redshifts. We develop a formalism which incorporates these requirements and, in
particular, a set of plausible models for the evolution of the bias factor. We
apply this formalism to the spatial, angular and projected correlation
functions from different samples of high-redshift objects, assuming a simple
phenomenological model for the initial power-spectrum and an Einstein-de Sitter
cosmological model. We find that our model is roughly consistent with data on
the evolution of QSO and galaxy clustering, but only if the effective degree of
biasing is small. We discuss the differences between our analysis and other
theoretical studies of clustering evolution and argue that the dominant barrier
to making definitive predictions is uncertainty about the appropriate form of
the bias and its evolution with cosmic epoch.

variable $\beta$ allows one to scan the structure of the probability
distribution in the dynamic phase space. This formalism is applied here to a
Lorentz Lattice Gas, where a particle moving on a lattice of size $L^d$
collides with fixed scatterers placed at random locations. Here we give
rigorous arguments that the Ruelle pressure in the limit of infinit e systems
has two branches joining with a slope discontinuity at $\beta = 1$. The low and
high $\beta$--branches correspond to localization of trajectories on
respectively the ``most chaotic'' (highest density) region, and the ``most
deterministic'' (lowest density) region, i.e. $\psi(\beta)$ is completely
controlled by rare fluctuations in the distribution of scatterers on the
lattice, and it does not carry any information on the global structure of the
static disorder.
  As $\beta$ approaches unity from either side, a localization-delocalization
transition leads to a state where trajectories are extended and carry
information on transport properties. At finite $L$ the narrow region around
$\beta = 1$ where the trajectories are extended scales as $(\ln L)^{-\alpha}$,
where $\alpha$ depends on the sign of $1-\beta$, if $d>1$, and as $(L\ln
L)^{-1}$ if $d=1$. This result appears to be general for diffusive systems with
static disorder, such as random walks in random environments or for the
continuous Lorentz gas. Other models of random walks on disordered lattices,

research in automating diverse reasoning tasks about dynamical systems,
nonlinear controllers, kinematic mechanisms, and fluid motion, we have
identified a style of visual thinking, imagistic reasoning. Imagistic reasoning
organizes computations around image-like, analogue representations so that
perceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer structure
and behavior. Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to
perform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical
methods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to
unify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program
written in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous
field and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level
descriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a
multi-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by
forming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of
generic operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to
perform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and
successively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the
neighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To
illustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three
implemented problem solvers -- KAM, MAPS, and HIPAIR --- in terms of the
spatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of
commonly used routines.

$t\rightarrow W^{+} b$, the corrections to $t\rightarrow H^{+} b$ are large,
slowly decoupling and persist at a sizeable level even for all sparticle masses

of the SUSY effects, which amount to corrections of several ten percent, could
counterbalance the standard QCD corrections and even make them to appear with
the ``wrong'' sign. Therefore, if the charged Higgs decay of the top quark is
kinematically allowed -a possibility which is not excluded by the recent
measurements of the branching ratio $BR(t\rightarrow W^{+} b)$ at the Tevatron

the additional U(1) gauge boson to satisfy phenomenological bounds, then the
conditions for electroweak symmetry breaking will provide stringent
restrictions on the allowed parameter space of such a theory. We also determine
the masses of standard as well as exotic sfermions and find that it is possible

observation is that a light stop is difficult to accommodate with an extra U(1)

where the symmetry is unbroken, the analytic results agree spectacularly well
with the numerical ones in their common domain of validity. In the broken
symmetry case, slow roll initial conditions from the unstable minimum at the

of the vacuum energy.That is, particles are abundantly produced at the expense
of the quantum vacuum energy while the zero mode comes back to almost its
initial value.In both cases we obtain analytically and numerically the equation
of state which turns to be written in terms of an effective polytropic index
that interpolates between vacuum and radiation-like domination. We find that
simplified analysis based on harmonic behavior of the zero mode, giving rise to
a Mathieu equation forthe non-zero modes miss important physics. Furthermore,
analysis that do not include the full backreaction do not conserve energy,
resulting in unbound particle production. Our results do not support the recent
