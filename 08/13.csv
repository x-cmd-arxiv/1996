cosmology forever. The precise measurement of the angular anisotropy of the
cosmic microwave background should specify to a few percent all of the
parameters of the cosmological model which effect astrophysics. The growth of
structure will then be determined (but not yet observed) until gravitational
collapse becomes highly non-linear and stars, galaxies and active galactic
nuclei (AGN) form. These processes are hard to model with basic physics because
they are complex and allow a rich variety of expression. Instead observations
will determine when the first stars and quasars formed, and how and when
galaxies assembled. If we can reconcile the numerous contradictions which
characterize the subject today, cosmology will become a mature subject, founded
on the agreement between detailed, inclusive and realistic models, which make
precise predictions, and the wealth of new data which will come from a wide
variety of observations, at all wavelengths. This is an ambitious schedule, but
nothing less is worthy of the outstanding capabilities of the 8 -- 10 m
telescopes, the next generation space telescope, the opportunities at
millimeterto sub-millimeter wavelengths and advanced computer modeling. The ESO
Very Large Telescope (VLT) should play a major role in this revolution.

coupled with improved techniques to narrow the dispersion in SN Ia peak

parameter q_0. We estimate the expected uncertainty in the Hubble diagram
determination of q_0 due to weak lensing by structure in the universe, which
stochastically shifts the apparent brightness of distant standard candles.
Although the results are sensitive to the density power spectrum on small
scales, the induced flux dispersion sigma_m < 0.04 Omega_{m,0}^{1/2} mag for
sources at z \leq 0.5, well below the ``intrinsic"" spread of nearby SN Ia
magnitudes, sigma_M \simeq 0.2 mag. Thus, density inhomogeneities do not
significantly impact the current program to measure q_0, in contrast to a
recent claim. If, however, light-curve shape and other calibrators can reduce
the effective intrinsic spread to 0.1 mag at high z, then weak lensing could
increase the observed spread by 30% in an Omega_{m,0}=1 universe for SNe at z >

histories of dark matter haloes (so-called `{\it merger trees}') are analysed.
We compare the mass functions of dark haloes derived by a new method for
calculating merger trees, that proposed by Rodrigues \& Thomas (RT), with those
given by other methods such as the Block model, the Press-Schechter formula and
our own formula in which the mass functions are analytically expressed in a way
that takes into consideration the spatial correlations. It is found that the
mass functions given by the new method are well fit by those given by our
formula. We believe that new method (RT) {\it naturally} and correctly takes
into account the spatial correlations of the density fluctuations due to a
calculated, grid-based realisation of the density fluctuations and so is very
useful for estimating the merger tree accurately in a way that takes into
consideration spatial correlations.
  Moreover, by applying our formula, we present an analytic expression which
reproduces the mass function derived by the Block model. We therefore show
clearly why and how the mass functions given by the new method and the Block
model are different from each other. Furthermore, we note that the construction
of merger trees is sensitive to the criterion of collapse and merging of
overlapped haloes in cases in which two or more haloes happen to overlap. In
fact, it is shown that the mass function is very much affected when the
criterion of overlapping is changed.

galaxies at redshift near zero, including cluster richness, velocity
dispersion, X-ray luminosity, three total mass estimates (velocity-based,
temperature-based and gravitational lensing derived), gas fraction and
substructure. Unlike previous studies focusing on the Abell clusters, we
conservatively assume that both optical and X-ray observations can determine
the source (galaxy or hot X-ray gas) positions along the line of sight as well
as in the sky plane accurately; hence we only include sources inside the
velocity space defined by the cluster galaxies (filtered through the
pessimistic 3 sigma clipping algorithm) as possible contamination sources.
Projection effects are found to be important for some quantities but
insignificant for others. We show that, on average, the gas to total mass ratio
in clusters appears to be 30-40% higher than its corresponding global ratio.
Independent of its mean value, the broadness of the observed distribution of
gas to total mass ratio is adequately accounted for by projection effects,
alleviating the need to invoke (though not preventing) other non gravitational
physical processes. While the moderate boost in the ratio narrows the gap, it
is still not quite sufficient to reconcile the standard nucleosynthesis value
of $\Omega_b=0.0125(H_0/100)^{-2}$ and $\Omega=1$ with the observed gas to mass
ratio value in clusters of galaxies, $0.05(H_0/100)^{-3/2}$, for any plausible
value of $H_0$. However, it is worth noting that real observations of X-ray

projection contaminations than we allow for in our analysis. In contrast, the

exponential localization generally occurs for $\eta$ (a scaled $\hbar$) in the
infinitesimal vicinity of QAR points $\eta_0$. The localization length $\xi_0$
is determined from the analytical properties of the kicking potential. This
``QAR-localization"" is associated in some cases with an integrable limit of the
corresponding classical systems. The MKR dynamical problem is mapped into
pseudorandom tight-binding models, exhibiting dynamical localization (DL). By
considering exactly-solvable cases, numerical evidence is given that
QAR-localization is an excellent approximation to DL sufficiently close to QAR.
The transition from QAR-localization to DL in a semiclassical regime, as $\eta$
is varied, is studied. It is shown that this transition takes place via a
gradual reduction of the influence of the analyticity of the potential on the
analyticity of the eigenstates, as the level of chaos is increased.

exhibit the corresponding hidden gauge symmetries. We show that the theory can

dilaton sector the linear system that extends the previously known Lax pair has
the form of a twisted self-duality constraint that is the analog of the
self-duality constraint arising in extended supergravities in higher spacetime
dimensions. Our results furnish a group theoretical explanation for the

  from first principles","4 pages, 4 Postscript figure files, revtex",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.54.R8297",,"mtrl-th cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  For the orthorhombic intermetallic semiconductor Al$_2$Ru, the bandstructure,
valence charge density, zone center optical phonon frequencies, and Born
effective charge and electronic dielectric tensors are calculated using
variational density functional perturbation theory with {\em ab initio}
pseudopotentials and a plane wave basis set. Good agreement is obtained with
recent measurements on polycrystalline samples which showed anomalously strong
far IR absorption by optical phonons, while analysis of the valence charge
density shows that the static ionic charges of Al and Ru are negligible.
Hybridization is proposed as the single origin both of the semiconducting gap
and the anomalous Born effective charges. Analogous behavior is expected in
related compounds such as NiSnZr, PbTe, skutterudites, and Al-transition-metal
quasicrystals.

to study the Vlasov dynamics for fermi system on phase space lattice is
presented. To deal with fermions on lattice, the phase cell occupancy factors
are taken to be either 1 or 0 in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle.
This has significant implications. First, the dynamical evolution does not
alter initial temperature of the system and secondly, at finite temperature,
the proper statistical behaviour related to the fluctuations over the samples
is ensured. This method is applied for two distinct cases viz. the monopole
vibration of cold dilute nucleus and the evolution of ring shaped matter
distribution at finite temperature in the presence of radial flow. In the
latter case, fragment multiplicities are found to be depend on the flow
velocity. To check the reliability of the present calculations simulations have
been performed with different choices of the grid size.

Moreover, the recently reported transition from spirals to hexagons near the
core is shown to occur only in the presence of a non-variational nonlinearity,
and is triggered by the spiral core instability. Qualitative agreement between
the simulations and the experiments is demonstrated.

with the Cooper pair wave function belonging to a non-trivial irreducible
representation of the lattice point group. We argue that this d-wave symmetry
is related to a special form of the fermionic kinetic energy and does not
require any novel pairing mechanism. In this context, we present a detailed
study of the bound states and resonances formed by two lattice fermions
interacting via a non-retarded potential that is attractive for nearest
neighbors but repulsive for other relative positions. In the case of strong
binding, a pair formed by fermions on adjacent lattice sites can have a small
effective mass, thereby implying a high condensation temperature. For a weakly
bound state, a pair with non-trivial symmetry tends to be smaller in size than
an s-wave pair. These and other findings are discussed in connection with the
properties of high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors.
