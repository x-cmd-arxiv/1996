$5,000\le$ T$_{model}$ $\le 60,000$K, solar abundances, $\rho \propto r^{-3}$,
$\v_{max} = 2000\kms$, $L=6 \times 10^{4}\Lsun$, and a statistical or
microturbulent velocity of 50 $\kms$. We used the synthetic spectra to estimate
the model parameters corresponding to the observed {\it IUE} spectra. The fits
to the observations were then iteratively improved by changing the parameters
of the model atmospheres, in particular T$_{model}$ and the abundances, to
arrive at the best fits to the optically thick pseudo-continuum and the
features found in the {\it IUE} spectra. The {\it IUE} spectra show two
different optically thick subphases. The earliest spectra, taken a few days
after maximum optical light, show a pseudo-continuum created by overlapping
absorption lines. The later observations, taken approximately 3 weeks after
maximum light, show the simultaneous presence of allowed, semi-forbidden, and
forbidden lines in the observed spectra. Analysis of these phases indicate that
OS And 86 had solar metallicities except for Mg which showed evidence of being
underabundant by as much as a factor of 10. We determine a distance of 5.1 kpc
to OS And 86 and derive a peak bolometric luminosity of $\sim$ 5 $\times$
10$^4$ L$_{\odot}$. The computed nova parameters provide insights into the
physics of the early outburst and explain the spectra seen by {\it IUE}.
Lastly, we find evidence in the later observations for large non-LTE effects of
Fe{\sc ii} which, when included, lead to much better agreement with the

from nucleon primaries. All shower gamma rays above the photoproduction
threshold contribute to the number of muons $N_\mu$, which is thus proportional
to the primary gamma ray energy. With gamma ray energy 50 times higher than the
muon energy and a probability of muon production by the gammas of about 1\%,
muon detectors can match the detection efficiency of a GeV satellite detector
if their effective area is larger by $10^4$. The muons must have enough energy
for sufficiently accurate reconstruction of their direction for doing
astronomy. These conditions are satisfied by relatively shallow neutrino
detectors such as AMANDA and Lake Baikal and by gamma ray detectors like
MILAGRO. TeV muons from gamma ray primaries, on the other hand, are rare
because they are only produced by higher energy gamma rays whose flux is
suppressed by the decreasing flux at the source and by absorption on
interstellar light. We show that there is a window of opportunity for muon
astronomy with the AMANDA, Lake Baikal and MILAGRO detectors.

similar in spirit to the CM model (Canuto \& Mazzitelli 1991) since it accounts
for the full spectrum of the turbulent eddies rather than only one eddy, as
done in the mixing length theory (MLT). The model differs from the CM model in
the treatment of the rate of energy input $n_s(k)$ from the source that
generates the turbulence. In the present model, $n_s(k)$ is controlled by both
the {\it source} and {\it the turbulence} it ultimately generates, thus
ensuring a selfconsistent modeling of the turbulence. This improves the CM
model in which $n_s(k)$ was taken to be equal to the growth rate of the {\it
linear} unstable convective modes.
  However, since the formulation of a selfconsistent treatment is far from
simple, we were forced to use a representation of the nonlinear interactions
less complete than the one in the CM model. The ensuing equations were solved
numerically for a wide range of convective efficiencies. The results are the
convective flux, the mean square turbulent velocity, the root mean squared
turbulent pressure and the turbulent viscosity.
  We implemented the model in the ATON stellar structure code and computed the
evolution of a solar model. The results are generally similar to those of the
CM model and thus quite different from the MLT. The present model requires a
smaller overshoot into the upper radiative zone than does the CM model, in
accord with recent empirical estimates. Application to POP II stars and
comparison with the very metal-poor globular cluster M68 yields an age in the
range $11\div 12$ Gyr. This is somewhat younger than the CM age, which in turn
is younger than the corresponding MLT age, a result of possible cosmological
interest.

and $h(x)$ related to the trajectory size $R_S$ (gyration radius) as introduced
by Stauffer for the percolation problem, where $S$ is the length of a closed
trajectory. The scaling function $f(x)$ is in most cases found to be symmetric
double Gaussians with the same characteristic size exponent $\sigma=0.43\approx
3/7$ as was found at criticality. In contrast to previous assumptions of an
exponential dependence of $n_S$ on $S$, the Gaussian functions lead to a
stretched exponential dependence of $n_S$ on $S$, $n_S\sim e^{-S^{6/7}}$.
However, for the rotator model on the partially occupied square lattice, an
alternative scaling function near criticality is found, leading to a new
exponent $\sigma '=1.6\pm0.3$ and a super exponential dependence of $n_S$ on
$S$. The appearance of the same exponent $\sigma=3/7$ describing the behavior

finite positive coupling for the pair-hopping model. We re-examine the
controversy by making systematic comparisons between numerical results obtained
for the PH and attractive Hubbard models. To do so, we have calculated the
Luttinger parameters (spin and charge velocities, stiffnesses, etc...) of the
two models using both the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method for large
systems and Lancz\'os calculations with twisted boundary conditions for smaller
systems. Although most of our results confirm that both models are very similar

sizes considered by previous numerical studies (6-12 sites). However, we show
that these differences disappear at larger sizes (14-42 sites) when
sufficiently accurate eigenstates are considered. Accordingly, our results
strongly suggest that the ground-state phase transition previously found for
small systems is a finite size artefact. Interpreting our results within the
framework of the Luttinger liquid theory, we discuss the origin of the apparent
contradiction between the predictions of the perturbative Renormalization group

The recent realization that
the compactification radius in string theory might be large means that these

cosmological bound on the axion mass. Here we explore two schemes for
accommodating such light axions in cosmology. In the first, we note that in
string theory the universe is likely to be dominated early on by the coherent
oscillations of some moduli. The usual moduli problem assumes that these fields
have masses comparable to the gravitino. We argue that string moduli are likely
to be substantially more massive, eliminating this problem. In such cosmologies
the axion bound is significantly weakened. Plausible mechanisms for generating
the baryon number density are described. In the second, we point out that in
string theory, the axion potentials might be much larger at early times than at
present. In string theory, if CP violation is described by a small parameter,
the axion may sit sufficiently close to its true minimum to invalidate the
bounds.

assumptions this representation is in fact unique. We demonstrate that
corresponding Schwinger-Dyson equations lead to a closed set of integral
equations for two- and four-point correlation functions. Renormalization of the
model is performed and renormalization group equations are obtained. Some model
examples with discrete number of degrees of freedom are solved numerically. The
solution for one degree of freedom is compared with the planar approximation
for one matrix model. For large variety of coupling constant it reproduces the
planar approximation with good accuracy.

makes the density-dependence of the kaon mass softer. Thus, the kaon
condensation threshold is pushed up in the baryon density. The loop diagrams
tend to lower the kaon condensation point for lower values of $a_3 m_s$. We
also find that the S-wave kaon-nucleon interaction plays the dominant role in
