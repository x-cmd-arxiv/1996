origin of which has generally been thought to lie in turbulence. The energy of
turbulence could come from galactic rotation at large-scale, then cascade down
to be dissipated on small-scales by viscosity; it has been suggested that such
turbulence helps to prevent massive molecular clouds from collapsing in
response to their own gravity. Here we show that, on the contrary, self-gravity
itself may be the dominant factor in making clouds fractal. We develop a
field-theory approach to the structure of clouds, assuming them to be
isothermal, and with only gravitational interactions; we find that the observed
fractal dimension of the clouds arise naturally from this approach. Although
this result does not imply that turbulence is not important, it does
demonstrate that the fractal structure can be understood without it.

convection and its ramifications for the shock dynamics are investigated for
both 15 and 25 solar mass models, representative of the two classes of stars
with compact and extended iron cores, respectively. In the absence of neutrino
transport, prompt convection develops and dissipates on a time scale $\sim$15
ms for both models. Prompt convection seeds convection behind the shock, which
causes distortions in the shock's sphericity, but on the average, the shock
radius is not boosted significantly. In the presence of neutrino transport,
prompt convection velocities are too small relative to bulk inflow velocities
to result in any significant convective transport of entropy and leptons. A
simple analytical model supports our numerical results, indicating that the
inclusion of transport reduces the convection growth rates and asymptotic
velocities by factors of 4--250.

value is studied. The action considered is the standard Wilson action with the
addition of a plaquette restriction, which should not affect the continuum
limit of the theory. In this investigation, the strong coupling limit is also
taken. It is found that a deconfining phase transition occurs as the cutoff is
increased, on all lattices studied (up to $20^4$). The critical cutoff on the
infinite lattice appears to be around 0.55. For cutoffs above this, a fixed
point behavior is observed in the normalized fourth cumulant of the Polyakov
loop, suggesting the existence of a line of critical points corresponding to a
massless gluon phase, not unlike the situation in compact U(1). The Polyakov
loop susceptibility also appears to be diverging with lattice size at these
cutoffs. A strong finite volume behavior is observed in the pseudo-specific
heat. It is discussed whether these results could still be consistent with the
standard crossover picture which precludes the existence of a deconfining phase
transition on an infinite symmetric lattice.
