the complex plane is emloyed to address the interaction of the unstable growth
process with random initial conditions and perturbations.
  We argue that the effect of random noise is immense and that it can never be

scaling laws for the velocity and acceleration of the front as a function of
the system size and the level of noise, and analytic arguments that explain

arcsecond diameter Einstein ring with two bright compact (milliarcsecond)

brightness temperatures of these components are significantly lower than 10E10
K, less than is typical for compact synchrotron radio sources and less than is
implied by the short timescales of flux density variations. A possible
explanation is that interstellar scattering is broadening the apparent angular
size of the source and thereby reducing the observed brightness temperature.
Our VLBA data support this hypothesis. At 22 GHz the measured brightness
temperature is at least 10E11 K, and the deconvolved size of the core in the
southwest compact component is proportional to the wavelength squared between
1.3 cm (22 GHz) and 18 cm (1.7 GHz). VLBI observations at still higher
frequencies should be unaffected by interstellar scattering.

called sonoluminescence (SL). Two different phases of single bubble SL have
been proposed: diffusively stable and diffusively unstable SL. We present phase
diagrams in the gas concentration vs forcing pressure state space and also in
the ambient radius vs gas concentration and vs forcing pressure state spaces.
These phase diagrams are based on the thresholds for energy focusing in the
bubble and two kinds of instabilities, namely (i) shape instabilities and (ii)
diffusive instabilities. Stable SL only occurs in a tiny parameter window of
large forcing pressure amplitude $P_a \sim 1.2 - 1.5$atm and low gas
concentration of less than $0.4\%$ of the saturation. The upper concentration
threshold becomes smaller with increasing forcing. Our results quantitatively
agree with experimental results of Putterman's UCLA group on argon, but not on
air. However, air bubbles and other gas mixtures can also successfully be
treated in this approach if in addition (iii) chemical instabilities are
considered. -- All statements are based on the Rayleigh-Plesset ODE
approximation of the bubble dynamics, extended in an adiabatic approximation to
include mass diffusion effects. This approximation is the only way to explore
considerable portions of parameter space, as solving the full PDEs is
numerically too expensive. Therefore, we checked the adiabatic approximation by
comparison with the full numerical solution of the advection diffusion PDE and
find good agreement.

resonance parameters, which were extracted from experimental data using the
definition of a resonance based on the positions and widths of reaction cross
section peaks. However, they nicely agree with the results of an extended
R-matrix method which works at complex energies.

coming from the dynamical equation of motion of OVM almost explain the order of
delay times observed in actual traffic flows without introducing explicit delay
times. Delay times in various cases are estimated: the case of a leader vehicle
and its follower, a queue of vehicles controlled by traffic lights and
many-vehicle case of highway traffic flow. The remarkable result is that in
most of the situation for which we can make a reasonable definition of a delay
time, the obtained delay time is of order 1 second.

systems to solve the master equation by unraveling the density operator
evolution into individual stochastic trajectories in Hilbert space. This C++
class library offers a choice of integration algorithms for three important
unravelings of the master equation. Different physical systems are modeled by
different Hamiltonians and environment operators. The program achieves
flexibility and user friendliness, without sacrificing execution speed, through
the way it represents operators and states in Hilbert space. Primary operators,
implemented in the form of simple routines acting on single degrees of freedom,
can be used to build up arbitrarily complex operators in product Hilbert spaces
with arbitrary numbers of components. Standard algebraic notation is used to
build operators and to perform arithmetic operations on operators and states.
States can be represented in a local moving basis, often leading to dramatic
savings of computing resources. The state and operator classes are very general
and can be used independently of the quantum trajectory algorithms. Only a
rudimentary knowledge of C++ is required to use this package.

from the original ones. Binary nonlinearization procedure corresponding to the
Bargmann symmetry constraint is carried out for those Lax pairs. The proposed
Lax pairs together with adjoint Lax pairs are constrained as a hierarchy of
commutative, finite dimensional integrable Hamiltonian systems in the Liouville
sense, which also provides us with new examples of finite dimensional
integrable Hamiltonian systems. A sort of involutive solutions to the
Kaup-Newell hierarchy are exhibited through the obtained finite dimensional
integrable systems and the general involutive system engendered by binary
nonlinearization is reduced to a specific involutive system generated by
mono-nonlinearization.
