currently the best known mechanism for producing GRBs. We calculate the
hydrodynamic conditions and the cooling processes in internal shocks, that
occur when one layer overtakes another. We compare these conditions with the
conditions in external shocks that occur when the shell encounters the ISM. We
find that the complicated temporal structure observed in GRBs could be easily
explained in IS scenario. Unlike ES, the observed temporal structure simply
reflects the temporal behavior of the internal engine that produces the shell.
We also find that opacity and in particular the opacity for pair production
poses strong constraints on the parameter space and consequently bursts with
very narrow peaks are expected to be optically thick and would not contain GeV
photons. Finally we find that as in ES synchrotron is the most likely radiation
process.

encounters of equal-mass spherical galaxies. As an application, we determine
the rate of galaxy merging in clusters of galaxies. We present results for two
types of Plummer models (a full and a truncated one), two King models and the
Hernquist model. Cross sections are determined on the basis of a large number
($\sim 500$) of simulations of galaxy encounters, using the 10-Gigaflops GRAPE
3A special-purpose computer. We characterize the overall merger rate of
galaxies in a galaxy cluster by a single number, derived from our cross
sections by an integration over galaxy encounter velocities in the limit of a
constant density in velocity space. For small clusters, where the cluster
velocity dispersion may not significantly exceed the internal velocity
dispersion of the individual galaxies, this constant-density approximation may
not be valid. For those cases, we present separate results, based on
integrations of our cross sections over Maxwellian velocity distributions.
Finally, tidal effects from the cluster potential as well as from neighboring
galaxies may prevent a barely bound galaxy pair from spiraling in after their
first encounter. We give a quantitative estimate of the resulting reduction in
the actual merger rate, due to these tidal interactions.

sense that their predicted collapse time is much shorter than their current
age. Simulations using gas models and Fokker-Planck approximation have shown
that the central density of a globular cluster after the collapse undergoes
nonlinear oscillation with large amplitude (gravothermal oscillation). However,
whether such an oscillation actually takes place in a real $N$-body system has
remained unsolved, because an $N$-body simulation with a sufficiently high
resolution would have required the computing resource of the order of several
Gflops$\cdot$years. In the present paper, we report the result of such a
simulation, performed on a dedicated special-purpose computer GRAPE-4. We
simulated the evolution of isolated point-mass systems with up to 32,768
particles. The largest number of particles reported previously is 10,000. We
confirmed that gravothermal oscillation takes place in an $N$-body system. The
expansion phase shows all signatures that are considered as the evidences of
the gravothermal nature of the oscillation. At the maximum expansion, the core
radius is $\sim 1$\% of the half-mass radius for the run with 32,768 particles.
The maximum core size $r_c$ depends on $N$, as $<r_c> \propto N^{-1/3}$.

of two galaxies each containing a central massive black hole. Our main goal
here is to determine if the black hole binary can merge through the hardening
by dynamical friction and the gravitational wave radiation. We performed
$N$-body simulations of merging of two galaxies with wide range of total number
of particles to investigate the effect of the number of particles on the
evolution of the black hole binary. We found that the evolution timescale was
independent of the number of particles in the galaxy $N$ until the separation
reaches a critical value. After the separation became smaller than this
critical value, the evolution timescale was longer for larger number of
particles. Qualitatively, this behavior is understood naturally the result the
``loss-cone'' effect. However, the dependence of the timescale on $N$ is
noticeably weaker than the theoretical prediction. In addition, the critical
separation is smaller than the theoretical prediction. The timescale of
evolution through gravitational radiation at this critical separation is longer
than the Hubble time. We discuss the reason of these discrepancy and the
implication of the present result on the structure of the ellipticals and QSO
activities.

self-gravitating many-body systems. In this paper, we thus study the transition
phenomena after the first transition from a quasiequilibrium. We found that
irrespective of the initial conditions, the system wanders between many states
which yield the same properties of the quasiequilibrium as the water-bag. This
itinerancy is most prominent in the time scale $t\sim 10^5 \sim 10^6 t_c$. In
the midway between two succeeding quasiequilibria, the system experiences a
transient state, where one particle keeps exclusive high energy and its motion
decouples with the others. Though the transient state is not the thermally
relaxed equilibrium, its distribution quite resembles the isothermal
distribution. Thus the macroscopic relaxation we discussed in the previous
papers corresponds to the transition from one of quasiequilibria to a transient
state. Averaging the behavior over a time scale much longer than the
macroscopic relaxation time gives the isothermal distribution. Distribution of
lifetime $\tau$ of the transient states yields a power-law distribution of
$\tau^{-2}$. The transient state gives a clear example of chaotic itinerancy in
conserved dynamical systems. The mechanism of the onset of itinerancy is
examined.
