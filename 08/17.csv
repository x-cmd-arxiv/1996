kinematics of RR Lyrae stars. New proper motion, radial velocity, and abundance
data are used; the new data set is 50% larger, and of higher quality, than
previously available data sets. Based on an a priori kinematic study, we
separate the stars into halo and thick disk sub-populations. Statistical
parallax solutions on these sub-samples yield M_V(RR) = +0.71 +/- 0.12 at
<[Fe/H]> = -1.61 for the halo (162 stars), and M_V(RR) = +0.79 +/- 0.30 at
<[Fe/H]> = -0.76 for the thick disk (51 stars). The solutions yield kinematic
parameters (solar motion and velocity ellipsoid) in good agreement with
estimates of the halo and thick disk kinematics derived from both RR Lyrae
stars and other stellar tracers. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the
solutions are accurate, and that the errors may be smaller than the estimates
above. The simulations reveal a small bias in the disk solutions, and
appropriate corrections are derived. The large uncertainty in the disk M_V(RR)
prevents ascertaining the slope of the M_V(RR)-[Fe/H] relation. We find that
(1) the distance to the Galactic Center is 7.6 +/- 0.4 kpc; (2) the mean age of
the 17 oldest Galactic globular clusters is 16.5 _{-1.9}^{+2.1} Gyr; and (3)
the distance modulus of the LMC is 18.28 +/- 0.13 mag. Estimates of H_0 which
are based on an LMC distance modulus of 18.50 (e.g., Cepheid studies) increase
by 10% if they are recalibrated to match our LMC distance modulus.

to analyze issues pertaining to 4 dimensions in terms of the 3-dimensional
structures. An example is provided by the asymptotic structure at null
infinity: While these space-times fail to be asymptotically flat in 4
dimensions, they can admit a regular completion at null infinity in 3
dimensions. This completion is used to analyze the asymptotic symmetries,
introduce the analog of the 4-dimensional Bondi energy-momentum and write down
a flux formula.

because it pertains to a diffeomorphism invariant 3-dimensional field theory

due to certain peculiarities of 3 dimensions, the description of null infinity

$V_{KM}$ and quark masses in a form $(m_d,\ m_s,\ m_b)\propto (m_u,\ m_c,\
m_t)V_{KM}$. The formula agrees with experimental data well and has an
interesting geometric picture. The origin of such a formula is discussed in the
standard model.

boson poles, which enhance thermalization rates by some three orders of
magnitude. The right-helicity states of tau neutrinos will be brought in
equilibrium independently of their initial distribution at a temperature above
the poles if the tau neutrino mass is larger than about 10 keV.

gauge symmetry in the moduli space of M-Theory on $ K3 $ and those in the
moduli space of M-Theory on $T^{5}/{\bf Z}_{2} \times S^{1}$. Also, we employ
the above enhanced gauge symmetries to derive the existence of some points of
enhanced gauge symmetry in the moduli space of the Type IIA string theory.

approximation. A conjecture for the exact moduli space metric is given for all
collections of fundamental monopoles of distinct type, and various partial
confirmations of the conjecture are discussed. Upon the quantization of the
resulting multi-monopole dynamics in the context of $N=4$ supersymmetric
Yang-Mills-Higgs theories, one recovers the missing magnetic states that are
dual to some of the massive vector mesons. A generalization to monopoles with
nonabelian charges is also discussed.

statistics, physics, combinatorics, and representation theory. They are
pairwise orthogonal with repsect to two different inner products, the first
defined by integration over an n-dimensional torus, and the second defined via
a power series expansion.
  The nonsymmetric analogs of Jack polynomials were recently defined by Opdam
via the first inner product. In this paper we show that they are also
orthogonal with respect to an analog of the second product which was proposed
by Dunkl. We also derive an explict formula for their norms.

improvement towards enabling error correction and with it the practical
possibility of some more involved quantum computations, such as e.g.
factorization of large numbers.
