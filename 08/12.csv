features of Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe, plus the continuum, using data obtained
by the imaging spectrometers onboard the ASCA X-ray satellite. All the images
show the shell-like morphology characteristic of previously obtained broad-band
X-ray images, but are clearly distinct from each other. We use image
reconstruction techniques to achieve a spatial resolution of ~0.8'. Line
intensity ratios are used to make inferences about the remnant's physical
state, on average for the entire remnant, and with angular position around the
rim. The average temperature (T) of the Si and S ejecta in the remnant is
(0.8-1.1) X 10^7 K and the average ionization age (nt) is (0.8-1.3) X 10^11
cm^-3 s. For a constant nt, the observed relative brightness variations of Si
and S line image profiles with azimuthalangle imply differences of roughly a
factor of 1.3-1.8 in the temperature. We compare the radial brightness profiles
of our images to simple geometrical models, and find that a spherical emitting
geometry is favored over a torus. A spherical geometry is further supported by
the absence of systematic Doppler shifts across the remnant. The radial fit
results also suggest that some radial mixing of the ejecta has occurred.
However, the azimuthally averaged Fe K image peaks at a markedly lower radius
than the other images. The average Fe K / Fe L line intensity ratio and the
position of the Fe K energy centroid support a T several times higher and an nt
approx. a factor of ten lower than for the other elements, and imply that the
Fe ejecta must have retained some of its stratification. Although many of the
features in the 4-6 keV X-ray continuum correspond to those in the radio, there
is no obvious correlation between the relative brightness in these bands.

sample at the color of a redshifted but nonevolving Sbc galaxy, and find
distinctly different luminosity functions for red and blue galaxies. Red
galaxies have a shallow slope \alpha \approx -0.4 and dominate the bright end
of the luminosity function, while blue galaxies have a steep \alpha \approx
-1.4 and prevail at the faint end. Comparisons of the CNOC1 results to those
from the Canada-France (CFRS) and Autofib redshift surveys show broad agreement
among these independent samples, but there are also significant differences
which will require larger samples to resolve. Also, in CNOC1 the red galaxy
luminosity density stays about the same over the range z = 0.2-0.6, while the
blue galaxy luminosity density increases steadily with redshift. These results
are consistent with the trend of the luminosity density vs. redshift relations
seen in the CFRS, though the normalizations of the luminosity densities appear
to differ for blue galaxies. Comparison to the local luminosity function from
the Las Campanas redshift survey (LCRS) shows that the luminosity density at z
\approx 0.1 is only about half that seen at z \approx 0.4. A change in the
luminosity function shape, particularly at the faint end, appears to be
required to match the CNOC1 and LCRS luminosity functions, if galaxy evolution
is the sole cause of the differences seen. However, it should be noted that the
specific details of the construction of different surveys may complicate the
comparison of results and so may need to be considered carefully.

Galactic Pole QSO sample is examined in an effort to disentangle the effects of
luminosity and redshift in the amplitude of the optical variations. The
anticorrelation between variability and luminosity found by other authors is

redshift, most likely due to an anticorrelation between variability and
wavelength. In particular, our parametric fits show that the QSO
variability-wavelength relation is consistent with that observed in
low-luminosity nearby active galactic nuclei.
  The results are used to constrain Poissonian-type models. We find that if QSO
variability results from a random superposition of pulses, then the individual
events must have B-band energies between $\sim 10^{50}$ and a few times
$10^{51}$ erg and time-scales of $\sim 2$ yr. Generalized Poissonian models in

Survival through the supernova (SN) explosion and shrinkage of the orbit is
achieved by a kick velocity of appropriate magnitude and direction imparted to
the neutron star at its birth. We present analytical population synthesis
calculations of LMXBs forming via both the direct-SN and the helium-star SN
mechanisms, and compare the results. We find that the direct-SN channel
contributes a non-negligible fraction of the total LMXB population, depending
strongly on the r.m.s. magnitude of the kick velocity. More importantly, the
direct-SN mechanism provides a natural way for the formation of low-mass binary
pulsars in nearly circular orbits with orbital periods in excess of about 100
days, which cannot have been formed via the helium-star SN mechanism.

steep radio spectra. Twenty-nine objects have redshifts $z>2$, the largest
redshifts being almost 4. Our ultra steep spectrum (USS) criterion ($\alpha <
-1$) has proven to be the most efficient way of finding distant radio galaxies.
We find that even among the USS sources, there is a strong statistical
correlation between the spectral index and redshift. The most distant radio
galaxies within the USS sample have the steepest radio spectra.
  In our sample there are 3 radio galaxies at $z>3$ compared with 26 at $2 < z
< 3$. However, the present data do not allow us to decide whether there is a
decrease in co-moving source density at the highest redshifts.
  We have analyzed the spectra of the 30 objects with the highest redshifts
($z>1.9$). For these high redshift radio galaxies, Ly$\alpha$ is almost always
the dominant emission line, with a rest frame equivalent width ranging from
$\sim100$ \AA\ to more than 1000 \AA. The equivalent widths of the most
important emission lines (Ly$\alpha$, C\,{\small IV}, He\,{\small II},
C\,{\small III}]) are found to correlate strongly with each other. The large
rest frame equivalent widths and the correlation between the equivalent widths
of the emission lines, confirm that photoionization by a central continuum
source is most likely the dominant ionization mechanism.
  There are significant velocity differences between the various emission lines
of our high redshift radio galaxies; in particular the Ly$\alpha$ line is
shifted with respect to the higher ionization lines. Velocity shifts range from
100 to almost 1000 km s$^{-1}$ in some cases. Simulations show that the effects

is physically equivalent but geometrically more clear. 1. We write $4 \pi$

and its contractions (including the Einstein tensor at the l.h.s.) with one
half of its usual value. This compensates not only for the change made at the
r.h.s., but it gives the result that the curvature scalar of the unit 2--sphere
equals one, i.e., in two dimensions, now the Gaussian curvature and the Ricci
scalar coincide. 3. For the commutator $[u,v]$ of the vector fields $u$ and $v$
we prefer to write (because of the analogy with the antisymmetrization of

half of the usual value. Then, the curvature operator defined by $$ \nabla_{[u}

recently by Cappelli and Zemba. This latter problem is also a natural one from
the perspective of conformal field theory. In this paper we completely solve
this problem, expressing the answer in terms of self-dual lattices, or
equivalently, rational points on the dual Grassmannian $G_{m,m}(R)^*$. We also
find all modular invariant partition functions for $su(2)\oplus u(1)^m$, from

The `A-D-E classification' of these, though often quoted in the literature,
turns out to be a very coarse-grained one: e.g. associated with the names
$E_6,E_7,E_8$, respectively, are precisely 20,30,24 different partition
functions. As a by-product of our analysis, we find that the list of modular

background -- equivariant cohomology and the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem, we
demonstrate how the localization ideas are related to classical integrability
and how they can be formally extended to derive explicit localization formulas
for path integrals in special instances using BRST quantization techniques.
Various loop space localizations are presented and related to notions in
quantum integrability and topological field theory. We emphasize the common
symmetries that such localizable models always possess and use these symmetries
to discuss the range of applicability of the localization formulas. A number of
physical and mathematical applications are presented in connection with
elementary quantum mechanics, Morse theory, index theorems, character formulas
for semi-simple Lie groups, quantization of spin systems, unitary integrations
in matrix models, modular invariants of Riemann surfaces, supersymmetric
quantum field theories, two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, conformal field

theory. Some modern techniques of path integral quantization, such as coherent
state methods, are also discussed. The relations between equivariant
