that these correlations can be explained by the presence of relatively small
quasar clusters (3-6 objects) which may possibly belong to larger structures
such as Large Quasar Groups found in the bigger surveys. The sizes of these
clusters along the redshift direction and distances between them are similar to
those for structures found recently in studies of CIV absorption systems. These
results present further evidence for the existence of large-scale structures at

  http://www.astr.ua.edu/preprints/white/",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We describe the use of partially overlapping galaxies to provide direct
measurements of the effective absorption in galaxy disks, independent of
assumptions about internal disk structure. The non-overlapping parts of the
galaxies and symmetry considerations are used to reconstruct, via differential
photometry, how much background galaxy light is lost in passing through the
foreground disks. Extensive catalog searches yield ~15-25 nearby galaxy pairs
suitable for varying degrees of our analysis; ten of the best such examples are
presented here. From these pairs, we find that interarm extinction is modest,
declining from A_B ~1 magnitude at 0.3 R_25^B to essentially zero by R_25^B;
the interarm dust has a scale length consistent with that of the disk
starlight. In contrast, dust in spiral arms and resonance rings may be
optically thick (A_B > 2) at virtually any radius. Some disks have flatter
extinction curves than the Galaxy, with A_B/A_I = 1.6; this is probably the
signature of clumpy dust distributions. Even though typical spirals are not
optically thick throughout their disks, where they {\it are} optically thick is
correlated with where they are most luminous: in spiral arms and inner disks.
This correlation between absorption and emission regions may account for their
apparent surface brightness being only mildly dependent on inclination,
erroneously indicating that spirals are generally optically thick. Taken as an
ensemble, the opacities of spiral galaxies may be just great enough to
significantly affect QSO counts, though not enough to cause their high redshift
cutoff.

  Of The Optical Depth Distribution","ApJ Letters, in press, substantial changes have been made from the
  last version",,"10.1086/310587",,"astro-ph",,"  We pay particular attention to the high end of the $\lya$ optical depth
distribution of a quasar spectrum. Based on the flux distribution
(Miralda-Escud\'e et al 1996), a simple yet seemingly cosmological model
-differentiating statistic, $\Delta_{\tau_0}$ -- the cumulative probability of
a quasar spectrum with $\lya$ optical depth greater than a high value $\tau_0$
-- is emphasized. It is shown that two different models -- the cold dark matter
model with a cosmological constant and the mixed hot and cold dark matter
model, both normalized to COBE and local galaxy cluster abundance -- yield
quite different values of $\Delta_{\tau_0}$: 0.13 of the former versus 0.058 of
the latter for $\tau_0=3.0$ at $z=3$. Moreover, it is argued that
$\Delta_{\tau_0}$ may be fairly robust to compute theoretically because it does
not seem to depend sensitively on small variations of simulations parameters
such as radiation field, cooling, feedback process, radiative transfer,
resolution and simulation volume within the plausible ranges of the concerned
quantities. Furthermore, it is illustrated that $\Delta_{\tau_0}$ can be
obtained sufficiently accurately from currently available observed quasar
spectra for $\tau_0\sim 3.0-4.0$, when observational noise is properly taken
into account. We anticipate that analyses of observations of quasar $\lya$
absorption spectra over a range of redshift may be able to constrain the
redshift evolution of the amplitude of the density fluctuations on
small-to-intermediate scales, therefore providing an independent constraint on
$\Omega_0$, $\Omega_{0,HDM}$ and $\Lambda_0$.

wave (SAW) with a two-dimensional electron gas confined to an isolated quantum
dot. The electron motion in the dot is diffusive. The electron-electron
interaction is accounted for by solving the screening problem in real space.
Since the screening in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures is strong, an approximate
inversion of the dielectric function epsilon(r,r') can be utilized, providing a
comprehensive qualitative picture of the screened SAW potential and the charge
redistribution in the dot. We calculate the absorption and the scattering
cross-sections for SAW's as a function of the area of the dot, A, the sound
wave vector, q, and the diffusion coefficient D of the electrons. Approximate
analytical expressions for the cross-sections are derived for all cases where
the quantities A*q^2 and A*omega/D are much larger or smaller than unity; omega
is the SAW frequency. Numerical results which include the intermediate regimes
and show the sample-specific dependence of the cross-sections on the angles of
incidence and scattering of surface phonons are discussed. The weak
localization corrections to the cross-sections are found and discussed as a
function of a weak magnetic field, the frequency, and the temperature. Due to
the absence of current-carrying contacts, the phase coherence of the electron
motion, and in turn the quantum corrections, increase as the size of the dot
shrinks. This shows that scattering and absorption of sound as noninvasive
probes may be advantageous in comparison to transport experiments for the
investigation of very small electronic systems.

the LEP and LEP200 $e^+e^-$ colliders. We consider single leptoquark production
via resolved photon contributions which offers a much higher kinematic limit
than the more commonly considered leptoquark pair production process. This
process also has the advantage that it is independent of the leptoquark
chirality, is almost insensitive to whether the leptoquark is scalar or vector,
and only depends on the leptoquark charge. We estimate that from the
nonobservation of energetic $e-jet$ events, the limits at LEP for all types of
leptoquarks are $M_{LQ} > 90$~GeV. For the just completed $\sqrt{s}=161$~GeV
run at LEP200 we estimate potential scalar leptoquark mass limits of $M_{LQ} >
130$~GeV for $Q_{LQ}=-2/3, \; -4/3$ and $M_{LQ} > 148$~GeV for $Q_{LQ}=-1/3, \;
-5/3$ and for vector LQ's the limits are 140 and 154~GeV respectively.
Ultimately, LEP200 should be able to achieve discovery limits for leptoquarks
of $\sim 188$~GeV for the $\sqrt{s}=190$~GeV runs. In all cases we assume
electromagnetic strength coupling.

perturbative ten-dimensional superstrings have in their turn been superseded by
a new non-perturbative theory called {\it $M$-theory}, which describes
supermembranes and superfivebranes, which subsumes all five consistent string
theories and whose low energy limit is, ironically, eleven-dimensional
supergravity. In particular, six-dimensional string/string duality follows from
membrane/fivebrane duality by compactifying $M$-theory on $S^1/Z_2 \times K3$

and the classical action satisfy a natural compatibility condition. We consider
the interest of this condition to be twofold: First, the naturality
(functoriality) of the compatibility condition suggests that it be used for
geometrical applications of renormalized functional integration. Second, the
compatibility can be used as the definition of a category; consideration of
this category as the central object of study in quantum field theory seems to
have quite some advantages over previously introduced theories of the type
``S-matrix theory'', ``Vertex operator algebras'', since this seems to be the
only category in which both the action and the expectation values enter, the
two being linked roughly speaking by a combination of the Frobenius property
and the renormalized Schwinger-Dyson equation.

  Two issues new in the study related to the first part of the 16th Hilbert

components of the curve between the components of the non-connected cubic
surface which turns out to depend on the patterns of arrangements (see Theorem
1). The other is presence of positive genus among the components of the
complement and genus-related restrictions (see Theorems 3 and 4).
