both collisional and radiative processes for the following nine separate

the evolution must be integrated along the whole of the subsequent trajectory.
In general there is an inequality between the ratio of tensor to scalar

conditional averages $\langle\nabla^2 T\big|\Delta T(R)\rangle$ and
$\langle|\nabla T|^2\big|\Delta T(R) \rangle$. We find exact relations between
these averages, and with the help of the fusion rules we propose a general
representation for these objects in terms of the probability density function
$P(\Delta T,R)$ of $\Delta T(R)$. These results offer a new way to analyze
experimental data that is presented in this paper. The main question that we
ask is whether the conditional average $\langle\nabla^2 T\big| \Delta

parameter which governs the deviation from linearity. The data analysis
indicates that this parameter is very small for passive scalar advection, and
is generally a decreasing function of the Rayleigh number for the convection

expressed in terms of the curvature perturbation becomes singular. In this
paper it is shown that in spite of this singular behavior of the evolution
equation the Bardeen parameter stays constant in a good accuracy during this
stage for superhorizon-scale perturbations except for a sequence of negligibly
short intervals around the zero points of the time derivative of the scalar
field. This justifies the conventional formula relating the amplitudes of
quantum fluctuations during inflation and those of adiabatic perturbations at
horizon crossing in the Friedmann stage, except for possible corrections
produced by the energy transfer from the scalar field to radiation in the late
stage of reheating. It is further shown that outside the above sequence of time

the adiabatic geometrical phase for a classical relativistic charged scalar
field in a curved background spacetime which is minimally coupled to
electromagnetism and an arbitrary (non-electromagnetic) scalar potential. It
involves a two-component formulation of the corresponding Klein-Gordon
equation. A precise definition of the adiabatic approximation is offered and
conditions of its validity are discussed. It is shown that the adiabatic
geometric phase can be computed without making a particular choice for an inner
product on the space of solutions of the field equations. What is needed is
just an inner product on the Hilbert space of the square integrable functions
defined on the spatial hypersurfaces. The two-component formalism is applied in
the investigation of the adiabatic geometric phases for several specific
examples, namely, a rotating magnetic field in Minkowski space, a rotating
cosmic string, and an arbitrary spatially homogeneous cosmological background.
It is shown that the two-component formalism reproduces the known results for
the first two examples. It also leads to several interesting results for the
case of spatially homogeneous cosmological models. In particular, it is shown
that the adiabatic geometric phase angles vanish for Bianchi type I models. The
situation is completely different for Bianchi type IX models where a variety of
nontrivial non-Abelian adiabatic geometrical phases can occur. The analogy
between the adiabatic geometric phases induced by the Bianchi type IX
backgrounds and those associated with the well-known time-dependent nuclear
quadrupole Hamiltonians is also pointed out.

distances with fixed error. In this report a method is given which has the
property that to store or transmit a qubit with maximum error $\epsilon$

with error at most $\epsilon$, independent of how long we wish to store the
state or how far we wish to transmit it. The method relies on using
