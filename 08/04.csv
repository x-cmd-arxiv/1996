to lie in walls concentric about the observer, forming a rough bull's-eye
pattern. We simulate what an observer would see in a thin slice of
redshift-space, including a magnitude limit and constant slice angle. The
result is an enhanced ring of galaxies encircling the observer at a distance
roughly corresponding to the peak of the selection function. This ring is an
artificial enhancement of weak features in real-space. This may explain
visually prominent features such as the ``Great Wall'' and periodicity found in
deep narrow fields.

  figure",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.1564",,"cond-mat",,"  It has been shown that the presence of a metal plate near a double quantum
well with spatially separated electron and hole layers may lead to a drastic
reconstruction of the system state with the formation of stable charged
complexes of several electrons bound to a spatially separated hole. Complexes
of both the Fermi and the Bose statistics may coexist in the ground state and
their relative densities may be changed with the change of the electron and
hole densities. The stability of the charged complexes may be increased by an
external magnetic field perpendicular to the layers plane.

that the recently developed new computational methods can be used in studies of

to classify showers due to e.g. primary particle mass as well as to find a
particular EAS parameter like e.g. total muon number. The examples of both
kinds of analysis are given and discussed.

relations for the quantum groups obtained in our earlier work, PBW-type results

the twist operator relating ``conjugated'' versions of these quantum groups.

introducing the notion of ""quantum exponential maps"", we give a criterion
characterizing Fedosov connections. As a consequence, a geometric realization
is obtained for the equivalence between an arbitrary *-product and a Fedosov
one. Every Fedosov *-product is shown to be a Vey *-product. Consequently, one
obtains that every *-product is equivalent to a Vey * -product, a classical
result of Lichnerowicz. Quantization of a hamiltonian G-space, and in
particular, quantum momentum maps are studied. Lagrangian submanifolds are also
studied under a deformation quantization.
