quantum well. Due to a separation of charges to opposite sides of the well, a
single wide well can be modelled as an effective two level system. We provide
numerical evidence of the existence of a phase transition from an
incompressible to a compressible state as the electron density is increased for
specific well width. Our numerical results show a critical electron density
which depends on well width, beyond which a transition incompressible double
layer quantum Hall state to a mono-layer compressible state occurs. We also
calculate the related phase boundary corresponding to destruction of the
collective mode energy gap. We show that the effective tunneling term and the
interlayer separation are both renormalised by the strong magnetic field. We
also exploite the local density functional techniques in the presence of strong
magnetic field at $\nu=1$ to calculate renormalized $\Delta_{SAS}$. The
numerical results shows good agreement between many-body calculations and local
density functional techniques in the presence of a strong magnetic field at
$\nu=1$. we also discuss implications of this work on the $\nu=1/2$
incompressible state observed in SWQW.

scaling'' of the low-temperature conductance (and conductivity) peak-heights of
two-dimensional electron systems in the integer and fractional quantum Hall
regimes. This explanation is based on the hypothesis that samples which show
this behavior contain density inhomogeneities. Theory then relates the
non-universal conductance peak-heights to the ``number of alternating
percolation clusters'' of a continuum percolation model defined on the
spatially-varying local carrier density. We discuss the statistical properties
of the number of alternating percolation clusters for Corbino disc samples
characterized by random density fluctuations which have a correlation length
small compared to the sample size. This allows a determination of the
statistical properties of the low-temperature conductance peak-heights of such
samples. We focus on a range of filling fraction at the center of the plateau
transition for which the percolation model may be considered to be critical. We
appeal to conformal invariance of critical percolation and argue that the
properties of interest are directly related to the corresponding quantities
calculated numerically for bond-percolation on a cylinder. Our results allow a
lower bound to be placed on the non-universal conductance peak-heights, and we
compare these results with recent experimental measurements.

be equal to the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ of the scattering process, the
perturbative approach fails for relatively small values of the Higgs mass and
coupling, $\lambda(\sqrt{s})\approx 2.2$. Performing an approximate resummation
of ``bubble'' Feynman diagrams, we find the scale $\mu=\sqrt{s}/ e \approx
\sqrt{s}/2.7$ to yield reliable perturbative results, even for large Higgs mass
and coupling. The new perturbative upper limit on the Higgs running coupling is
$\lambda(\sqrt{s}/ e)\approx 4$.

N. It is shown that there is no mixing among scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs
fields in the two Higgs doublets, and scalar-pseudoscalar mixings could exist
between two Higgs doublets and the singlet N, and between N itself. CP symmetry
is conserved in the extreme limits of < N > >> v, < N > << v, and tan beta >>
1. In the region of < N > = O(v) and tan beta = O(1), large scalar-pseudoscalar
mixings are realized, and this effect can reduce the lightest Higgs mass. The
mass difference between no mixing and mixing case is about 10 - 30 GeV. The
neutron electric dipole moment in this model is consistent with the present
experimental upper limit provided that squark and gaugino masses are heavy
enough of O(1) TeV.
