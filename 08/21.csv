change through capture into and escape from resonance. Capture problems fall
into distinct cases depending upon the shape of the potential well. To
visualise the effective potential well for orbital capture, a diagrammatic
approach to the resonant perturbation theory of Born is presented. These
diagrams we call equiaction sections. To illustrate their use, we present
examples drawn from both galactic and Solar System dynamics. The probability of
capture for generic shapes of the potential well is calculated. A number of
predictions are made. First, there are barred galaxies that possess two outer
rings of gas and stars (type R1R2). We show how to relate changes in the
pattern speed and amplitude of the bar to the strength of the two rings.
Secondly, under certain conditions, small disturbances can lead to dramatic
changes in orbital shape. This can be exploited as a mechanism to pump
counter-rotating stars and gas into the nuclei of disk galaxies. Tidal resonant
forcing of highly inclined orbits around a central mass causes a substantial
increase in the likelihood of collision. Thirdly, the angular momentum of a
potential well is changed by the passage of stars across or capture into the
well. This can lead to the creation of holes, notches and high velocity tails
in the stellar distribution function, whose form we explicitly calculate.

anisotropy pattern, which can best be analyzed in Fourier domain. This allows
one to unambiguously distinguish cosmological signal of polarization from other
foregrounds and systematics, as well as from polarization induced by non-scalar
perturbations. The precision with which polarization and cross-correlation
power spectra can be determined is limited by cosmic variance, noise and
foreground residuals. Choice of estimator can significantly improve our
capability of extracting cosmological signal and in the noise dominated limit
the optimal power spectrum estimator reduces the variance by a factor of two
compared to the simplest estimator. If foreground residuals are important then
a different estimator can be used, which eliminates systematic effects from
foregrounds so that no further foreground subtraction is needed. A particular
combination of Stokes $Q$ and $U$ parameters vanishes for scalar induced
polarization, thereby allowing an unambiguous determination of tensor modes.
Theoretical predictions of polarization in standard models show that one
typically expects a signal at the level of 5-10$\mu$K on small angular scales
and around 1$\mu$K on large scales ($l<200$). Satellite missions should be able
to reach sensitivities needed for an unambiguous detection of polarization,

expressed in terms of $L$-function of a motive. The Beilinson conjectures on
the values of $L$-functions are interpreted as dealing with the cosmological

processes described by symmetric potentials including interactions between

(spin-flipping) problem we obtain an effective action for the collective modes
of the model at T = 0, containing WZW-type terms. When spin-flipping processes
are disregarded the structure of the action is considerably simplified,
allowing us to derive exact expressions for the dispersion relations of
collective modes and two point fermionic correlation functions as functionals
of the potentials. Finally, as an example, we compute the momentum distribution
for the case in which electrons and impurities are coupled through spin and
spin-current densities only. The formulae we get suggest that our formalism
could be useful in order to seek for a mechanism able to restore Fermi liquid
