assume to have dimension 1. If $X$ is a smooth complex variety, then the
geometric invariant theory quotient $X//G$ can be identifed with the symplectic
reduction $X_r$. Lerman introduced a construction (valid for symplectic
manifolds) called symplectic cutting, which constructs a manifold $X_c$, such
that $X_c$ is the union of $X_r$ and an open subset $X_{>0} \subset X$.
Moreover, there is a natural torus action on $X_c$ such that $X_r$ is a
component of the fixed locus. Using localization for equivariant cohomology,
this construction can be used to study of $X_r$.
  In this note, we give an algebraic version of this construction valid for
projective but possibly singular varieties defined over arbitrary fields. This
construction is useful for studying $X_r$ from the point of view of algebraic
geometry, using the equivariant intersection theory developed by the authors.
At the end of the paper we briefly give an adaptation of Lerman's proof of the
Kalkman residue formula and use it to give some formulas for characteristic
numbers of quotients by a torus.

Lyman-alpha forest for column densities in the range $10^{12.5} - 10^{14.5}
cm^{-2}$. The Zel'dovich approximation, with appropriate smoothing, is used to
compute the density and peculiar velocity fields. The effect of the latter on
absorption profiles is discussed and it is shown to have little effect on the
column density distribution. An approximation is introduced in which the column
density distribution is related to a statistic of density peaks (involving its
height and first and second derivatives along the line of sight) in real space.
We show that the slope of the column density distribution is determined by the
temperature-density relation as well as the power spectrum on scales $2 h
Mpc^{-1} < k < 20 h Mpc^{-1}$. An expression relating the three is given. We
find very good agreement between the column density distribution obtained by
applying the Voigt-profile-fitting technique to the output of a full
hydrodynamic simulation and that obtained using our approximate method for a
test model. This formalism then is applied to study a group of CDM as well as
CHDM models. We show that the amplitude of the column density distribution
depends on the combination of parameters $(\Omega_b h^2)^2 T_0^{-0.7}
J_{HI}^{-1}$, which is not well-constrained by independent observations. The
slope of the distribution, on the other hand, can be used to distinguish
between different models: those with a smaller amplitude and a steeper slope of
the power spectrum on small scales give rise to steeper distributions, for the
range of column densities we study. Comparison with high resolution Keck data
is made.

happens like in spherical wormholes, but the other region (the rest of the

to an energy density which is always positive for large speeds at or near the

longitudinal as well as the $\perp$ spatial directions one obtains linear
confinement. The confinement mechanism in light-front QCD depends on the
orientation of the external charges: for longitudinally (with respect to the
boost direction in the infinite momentum frame) separated quarks, confinement
arises from the instantaneous interaction piece in the Hamiltonian while for
$\perp$ separated quarks, the confinement mechanism is similar to the one in
Hamiltonian lattice QCD. Nevertheless, already a very simple ansatz for the
effective link-field potential yields an almost rotationally symmetric
$Q\bar{Q}$ potential. The momentum carried by the glue strongly depends on the
orientation (""polarization"") of the $Q\bar{Q}$ pair.

We show that a bound state of 1-branes stretching between two separated
3-branes exhibits a family of super-symmetric ground states that can be
identified with the ADHMN construction of the moduli space of $SU(2)$
monopoles.. This identification is supported by the construction of the
monopole gauge field as a space-time coupling in the quantum mechanical
effective action of a 1-brane used as a probe. The analysis also reveals an
intriguing aspect of the 1-brane theory:the transverse oscillations of the
1-branes in the ground states are described by non-commuting matrix valued
fields which develop poles at the boundary. Finally, the construction is
generalized to $SU(n)$ monopoles with arbitrary $n>2$.

moment is 2 \mu_B per Cr atom, with the Fermi level for minority spins lying in

bialgebra cross products over the Hopf algebra $H$ are precisely described by
$H$-crossed module bialgebras. We study the theory of (bicovariant)
differential calculi in braided abelian categories and we construct
$\NN_0$-graded bicovariant differential calculi out of first order bicovariant
differential calculi. These objects are shown to be Hopf algebra differential
