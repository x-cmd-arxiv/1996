such neutrinos results from photopion production by EHE cosmic rays in the

ray source evolution which are consistent with results from the deep QSO survey
in the radio and X-ray range, the resultant flux of neutrinos from this process
is not strong enough for plausible detection. A measurable flux of EHE
neutrinos may be present, however, if the highest energy cosmic rays which have
recently been detected well beyond 10^20 eV are the result of the annihilation
of topological defects which formed in the early universe. Neutrinos resulting
from such decays reach energies of the grand unification (GUT) scale, and
collisions of superhigh energy neutrinos with the cosmic background neutrinos
initiate neutrino cascading which enhances the EHE neutrino flux at Earth. We
have calculated the neutrino flux including this cascading effect for either
massless or massive neutrinos and we find that these fluxes are conceivably
detectable by air fluorescence detectors now in development. The
neutrino-induced showers would be recognized by their starting deep in the
atmosphere. We evaluate the feasibility of detecting EHE neutrinos this way
using air fluorescence air shower detectors and derive the expected event rate.
Other processes for producing deeply penetrating air showers constitute a
negligible background.

the kinetics taking place at the interface itself. When applied to non-ionic
surfactant systems, the theory recovers results of previous models, justify
their assumptions and predicts a diffusion-limited adsorption, in accord with
experiments. For salt-free ionic surfactant solutions, electrostatic
interactions are shown to drastically affect the kinetics. The adsorption in
this case is predicted to be kinetically limited, and the theory accounts for
unusual experimental results obtained recently for the dynamic surface tension
of such systems. Addition of salt to an ionic surfactant solution leads to
screening of the electrostatic interactions and to a diffusion-limited
adsorption. In addition, the free-energy formulation offers a general method
for relating the dynamic surface tension to surface coverage without relying on

realistic NN kernel. Particular effort is made to connect the structure
functions to the densities of the appropriate charges and currents. This allows
for a systematic comparison between the relativistic and nonrelativistic
calculations, by analysing the same densities in both approaches. Thus, the
sources of the relativistic effects in the structure functions are understood
and clearly distinguished from variations caused by the differences in the
model parameters. We present both the formalism and extensive numerical
calculations for all steps of our analysis. We find that the nonrelativistic
and relativistic calculations are qualitatively very much alike. However, three
main features systematically distinguish a consistent relativistic approach
from the nonrelativistic one: (i) the binding effects are larger, (ii) the
effect of Fermi motion at high $x$ is stronger and (iii) the relativistic
description of the structure functions b_{1,2}^D is fully consistent, unlike
the nonrelativistic approach, which is internally inconsistent and violates the
fundamental sum rules.

cross section of arbitrary shape is investigated within the framework of the
ideal MHD theory. For the system under consideration it is shown that only
incompressible flows are possible and, conscequently, the general two
dimensional flow equilibrium equations reduce to a single second-order
quasilinear partial differential equation for the poloidal magnetic flux
function $\psi$, in which four profile functionals of $\psi$ appear. Apart from
a singularity occuring when the modulus of Mach number associated with the
Alfv\'en velocity for the poloidal magnetic field is unity, this equation is
always elliptic and permits the construction of several classes of analytic
solutions. Specific exact equlibria for a plasma confined within a perfectly
conducting circular cylindrical boundary and having i) a flat current density
and ii) a peaked current density are obtained and studied.

phase-space is an arbitrary Lie algebra. We also generalize to quantum Lie
algebras and to supersymmetric theories. It turns out that the
non-commutativity leads to a deformation of the classical phase-space: instead
of being a vector space it becomes a manifold, the topology of which is given
by the commutator relations. It is shown in fact that the classical
phase-space, for a semi-simple Lie algebra, becomes a homogenous symplectic
manifold. The symplectic product is also deformed. We finally make some
comments on how to generalize to $C^*$-algebras and other operator algebras
too.
