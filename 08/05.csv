is a concrete approximation to the restriction of the Grothendieck Duality
pseudofunctor ^! to the full subcategory of the derived category having
Cohen-Macaulay complexes as objects (a subcategory equivalent to the category
of Cousin complexes, once a codimension function has been fixed). Specifically,
for Cousin complexes M and any scheme map f:X -> Y as above, there is a
functorial derived-category map \gamma: f^# M -> f^! M inducing a functorial
isomorphism in the category of Cousin complexes f^# M \iso E(f^! M) (where E is
the Cousin functor). \gamma itself is an isomorphism if the complex f^! M is
Cohen-Macaulay--which will be so whenever the map f is flat or whenever the
complex M is injective. Also, f^# takes residual (resp. injective) complexes on
Y to residual (resp. injective) complexes on X; and so the pseudofunctor ^#
generalises--and makes canonical--the ""variance theory"" of residual complexes
developed in Chapter VI of Hartshorne's ""Residues and Duality.""
  Moreover, we generalise the Residue Theorem of loc.cit., p.369 by defining a
functorial Trace map of graded modules Tr_f(M): f_*f^# M -> M (a sum of local
residues) such that whenever f is proper, Tr_f(M) is a map of complexes and the

as a compactified, complexified moduli space for special Lagrangian tori on the
other Calabi-Yau manifold---is rather surprising. We formulate some precise
mathematical conjectures concerning how these moduli spaces are to be
compactified and complexified, as well as a definition of geometric mirror
pairs (in arbitrary dimension) which is independent of those conjectures. We
investigate how this new geometric description ought to be related to the
mathematical statements which have previously been extracted from mirror
symmetry. In particular, we discuss how the moduli spaces of the `mirror'
Calabi-Yau manifolds should be related to one another, and how appropriate
subspaces of the homology groups of those manifolds could be related. We treat
the case of K3 surfaces in some detail.

  A long straight string moving with a speed comparable to $c$ induces a planar
overdensity (a``wake""). Since the initial perturbation is a velocity kick
towards the plane behind the string and there is no initial Newtonian
gravitational line source, the baryons are trapped in the center of the wake,
leading to an enhanced baryon to dark matter ratio. The cold coherent flow
leads to very low post--shock temperatures of the baryonic fluid.
  In contrast, long strings with a lot of small-scale structure (which can be
described by adding a Newtonian gravitational line source) move slowly and form
filamentary objects. The large central pressure due to the gravitational
potential causes the baryons to be expelled from the central regions and leads
to a relative deficit in the baryon to dark matter ratio. In this case, the
velocity of the baryons is larger, leading to high post-shock temperatures.

`backside infall' to the Centaurus/Great Attractor region. A qualitative
comparison of the reconstructed IRAS gravity field with that from Tully-Fisher

Wiener reconstruction of the density field is also the optimal reconstruction
(in the minimum variance sense) of any quantity which is linear in the density

that derived from the Mark III peculiar velocities (370km/s). However, the two

Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) is carefully studied, in the limit of large
systems and long integration times, using an efficient new integration scheme.
Particular attention is paid to solutions with a non-zero phase gradient. For
fixed control parameters, solutions with conserved average phase gradient $\nu$
exist only for $|\nu|$ less than some upper limit. The transition from phase to
defect-turbulence happens when this limit becomes zero. A Lyapunov analysis
shows that the system becomes less and less chaotic for increasing values of
the phase gradient. For high values of the phase gradient a family of
non-chaotic solutions of the CGLE is found. These solutions consist of
spatially periodic or aperiodic waves travelling with constant velocity. They
typically have incommensurate velocities for phase and amplitude propagation,
showing thereby a novel type of quasiperiodic behavior. The main features of
these travelling wave solutions can be explained through a modified
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation that rules the phase dynamics of the CGLE in the
PT phase. The latter explains also the behavior of the maximal Lyapunov
exponents of chaotic solutions.

Einstein equations into the form of a flat-spacetime wave equation together
with a harmonic gauge condition, and solve it formally as a retarded integral
over the past null cone of the chosen field point. The part of this integral
that involves the matter sources and the near-zone gravitational field is
evaluated in terms of multipole moments using standard techniques; the
remainder of the retarded integral, extending over the radiation zone, is
evaluated in a novel way. The result is a manifestly convergent and finite
procedure for calculating gravitational radiation to arbitrary orders in a
post-Newtonian expansion. Through second post-Newtonian order, the radiation is
also shown to propagate toward the observer along true null rays of the
asymptotically Schwarzschild spacetime, despite having been derived using flat
spacetime wave equations. The method cures defects that plagued previous
``brute- force'' slow-motion approaches to the generation of gravitational
radiation, and yields results that agree perfectly with those recently obtained
by a mixed post-Minkowskian post-Newtonian method. We display explicit formulae

  QCD96 workshop, Paris, June 1996. to appear in the proceedings",,,"UNITU-THEP-11/1996","hep-ph hep-th",,"  On the level of an effective quark theory, we define confinement by the
absence of quark anti-quark thresholds in correlation functions. We then
propose a confining Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-type model. Its four fermion interaction
in the color channel is mediated by a random color matrix. We investigate the
model's phase structure as well as its behavior under extreme conditions, i.e.
high temperature and/or high density. In order to study the interplay of the
proposed mechanism of confinement and asymptotic freedom, we consider an
extended Gross-Neveu model. Quark anti-quark thresholds are proven to be absent
in the scalar correlation function implying that the decay of the scalar meson
into free quarks is avoided. The transition from the low energy to the high
energy perturbative regime is found to be smooth. Perturbation theory provides
a good description of Green's functions at high energies, although there is no
quark liberation.

original infinite sums representing the 4-point chiral correlators can be
effectively summed up. Using these simplified expressions with proper choices
of the contours we determine the duality (braid and fusion) transformations and
show that they are consistent with the fusion rules of Awata and Yamada. The
requirement of locality leads to a 1-parameter family of monodromy (braid)
invariants. These analogs of the ``diagonal'' 2-dimensional local 4-point
functions in the minimal Virasoro theory contain in general non-diagonal terms.
They correspond to pairs of fields of identical monodromy, having one and the
same counterpart in the limit to the Virasoro minimal correlators.

four dimensions on a large Calabi-Yau manifold ${\bf X}$, may represent a
viable candidate for the description of low-energy particle phenomenology. In
this regime, heterotic string theory is adequately described by low-energy
$M$-theory on ${\bf R}^4\times{\bf S}^1/{\bf Z}_2\times{\bf X}$, with the two
$E_8$'s supported at the two boundaries of the world. In this paper we study
the effects of gluino condensation, as a mechanism for supersymmetry breaking
in this $M$-theory regime. We show that when a gluino condensate forms in
$M$-theory, the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry can still be satisfied
locally in the orbifold dimension ${\bf S}^1/{\bf Z}_2$. Supersymmetry is then
only broken by the global topology of the orbifold dimension, in a mechanism
similar to the Casimir effect. This mechanism leads to a natural hierarchy of
scales, and elucidates some aspects of heterotic string theory that might be
relevant to the stabilization of moduli and the smallness of the cosmological
constant.

p-shell neutrons. Also, the recent data indicate that the Delta I = 1/2 rule,
well proved at the hadronic level, may not be sacred in the nuclear medium and
the Delta I = 3/2 interactions seem to be needed to describe the non-mesonic
decays of Lambda-hypernuclei.
