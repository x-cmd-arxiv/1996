framework of general relativity. Such a system can be described by the surface
tension $\sigma$, the bag constant $B$, and the fermion number density
$\rho_{0}$. Usually one of these parameters prevails in the system and thus
affects the spacetime inside the soliton. Whether it is described by Friedman
or de Sitter metric depends on the prevailing parameter. The whole spacetime is
devided by the surface of the soliton into the false vacuum region inside the
soliton and the true vacuum region outside, the latter being described by the
Schwarzschild line element. The aim of this paper is to study the equations of
motion of the domain wall in two cases. In the first case the de Sitter metric
describes the interior in the first case, and in the second case it is replaced
by the Friedman metric. In both of them the Schwarzschild metric is outside the
soliton. From the analysis of obtained equations one can draw conclusions
concerning further evolution of a soliton star.

may play an important role in the analysis of the existence of some classical
models. This, in fact, appears to be the case of static, uniform--density
models of the interior metric of cosmic strings and neutron stars. We consider
the fourth order semiclassical equations and first look for perturbative
solutions in the coupling constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the quadratic
curvature terms in the effective gravitational Lagrangian. We find that there
is not a consistent solution; neither for strings nor for spherical stars. We
then look for non--perturbative solutions and find an explicit approximate
metric for the case of straight cosmic strings. We finally analyse the
contribution of the non--local terms to the renormalized energy--momentum
tensor and the possibility of this terms to allow for a perturbative solution.
We explicitly build up a particular renormalized energy--momentum tensor to
fulfill that end. These state--dependent corrections are found by simple
considerations of symmetry, conservation law and trace anomaly, and are chosen
to compensate for the local terms. However, they are not only ad hoc, but have
to depend on $\alpha$ and $\beta$, what is not expected to first perturbative
order. We then conclude that non--perturbative solutions are valuable for
describing certain physical situations.

(CCMST) description of final-state interaction including both the coherent and
incoherent rescatterings of the ejectile state. We demonstrate that the
contribution of the off-diagonal incoherent rescattering does not vanish at low
Q^{2} which is a novel correction to the conventional Glauber theory evaluation
of nuclear transparency. We comment on the nontrivial impact of this correction
on the onset of CT. The sensitivity of the onset of CT to the 3q-nucleon
reggeon amplitudes is discussed for the first time. We present numerical
results for nuclear transparency as a function of the missing momentum for
exclusive (e,e'p) reaction in the kinematical region of Q^{2} \le 40 GeV^{2}
and p_{m} \le 250$ MeV/c. Our evaluations show that at Q^{2}\sim 10 CT effects
are substantial only in antiparallel kinematics at p_{m,z}\sim -250 MeV/c. The
effect is enhanced on light nuclei and could be observed in a high precision
experiment.
