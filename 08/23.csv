density of neutral gas in the Universe. Eleven high redshift damped Lya systems
covering 2.8<z<4.4 were discovered in 26 QSOs from the APM z>4 QSO Survey,
extending these absorption system surveys to the highest redshifts currently
possible. Combining our new data set with previous surveys we find that the
cosmological mass density in neutral gas, omega_g, does not rise as steeply
prior to z~2 as indicated by previous studies. There is evidence in the
observed omega_g for a flattening at z~2 and a possible turnover at z~3. When
combined with the decline at z>3.5 in number density per unit redshift of
damped systems with column densities log N(HI)>21 atoms cm^-2, these results
point to an epoch at z>3 prior to which the highest column density damped
systems are still forming. We find that over the redshift range 2<z<4 the total
mass in neutral gas is marginally comparable with the total visible mass in
stars in present day galaxies. However, if one considers the total mass visible
in stellar disks alone, ie excluding galactic bulges, the two values are
comparable. We are observing a mass of neutral gas comparable to the mass of
visible disk stars. Lanzetta, Wolfe & Turnshek (1995) found that omega_g(z~3.5)
was twice omega_g(z~2), implying a much larger amount of star formation must
have taken place between z=3.5 and z=2 than is indicated by metallicity
studies. This created a `cosmic G-dwarf problem'. The more gradual evolution of
omega_g we find alleviates this. These results have profound implications for
theories of galaxy formation.

where the major environmental factor is metallicity. Comparisons between
evolutionary models and observations of massive OB, WR stars and related

improvements of stellar models and theoretical developments in this respect. We
summarize evolutionary scenarios for the most massive stars and try to clarify
recent questions regarding their evolutionary status as core-H or core-He
burning objects. Another environmental effect, which might affect stellar
evolution is a cluster environment with a high stellar density. As test cases
of massive star evolution in dense clusters we summarize recent work on the
densest known resolved young clusters: R136, NGC 3603, and the three Galactic
Center star clusters (the central cluster, Quintuplet and ""Arches"" cluster).
For the central cluster we present new comparisons between stellar parameters
of emission line stars derived by Najarro et al. (1994, 1997), and appropriate
evolutionary models. From their parameters we argue that most of these stars
can be regarded as WNL stars, and do hence not necessarily represent a peculiar
class. We suggest that some apparent differences with well known WR stars can
be understood in terms of their core burning stage and/or other changes due to
a high metallicity. Based on our present knowledge we conclude that in young
clusters with central stellar densities up to rho_c ~ 10.**(5-6) Msun/pc**3 no
compelling evidence for a secondary effect influencing the evolution of massive
stars has yet been found.

account for the clustering of galaxies on large and small scales, and for the
evolution of clustering with epoch. No CDM-like spectrum is consistent with the
shape of the observed nonlinear spectrum. Unbiased low-density models greatly
overpredict the small-scale correlations; high-density models would require a
bias which does not vary monotonically with scale. The true linear power
spectrum contains a primordial feature at $k\simeq 0.1 \hompc$, and must break
quite abruptly to an effective slope of $n\ls -2.3$ on smaller scales This
empirical fluctuation spectrum also fits the CFRS data on the evolution of
clustering, provided the universe is open with $\Omega\simeq 0.3$. Only this
case explains naturally how the small-scale spectrum can evolve at the observed
rate while retaining the same power-law index. An unbiased open model also
matches correctly the large-scale COBE data, and offers an attractively simple
picture for the phenomenology of galaxy clustering.

propose the following picture: When $N_F \ge 17$, there is only a trivial fixed
point and therefore the theory in the continuum limit is trivial. On the other
hand, when $16 \ge N_F \ge 7$, there is a non-trivial fixed point and therefore
the theory is non-trivial with anomalous dimensions, however, without quark
confinement. Theories which satisfy both quark confinement and spontaneous
chiral symmetry breaking in the continuum limit exist only for $N_F \le 6$. We
also discuss the structure of the deconfining phase at finite temperatures for
the small number of flavors such as $N_F=2$ and 3, through a systematic study
of it for general number of flavors.

  We consider a variant of the standard electroweak theory in which the Higgs
sector has been modified so that there is a classically stable weak scale
soliton. We explore fermion number violating processes which involve soliton
decay. A soliton can decay by tunnelling under the sphaleron barrier or the
decay can be collision induced if the energy is sufficient for the barrier to
be traversed. We discuss classical solutions to the Minkowski space equations
of motion in which a soliton is kicked over the barrier by an incoming pulse.
We then consider a limit in which we can reliably estimate the amplitude for
soliton decay induced by collision with a single W-boson. This amplitude
depends on g like exp[-cg^(-1/3)], and is larger than that for spontaneous
decay via tunnelling in the same limit. Finally we show that in soliton decays,
light SU(2)_L doublet fermions are anomalously produced. Thus we have a
calculation of a two body process with energy above the sphaleron barrier in
which fermion number is violated.

reproduce the observed physics of the Standard Model. The second is to identify
experimental signatures of superstring unification which, if observed, will
provide further evidence for the validity of superstring theory. I discuss such
potential signatures of superstring unification. I propose that proton lifetime
constraints imply that the Standard Model gauge group must be obtained directly
at the string level. In this case the unifying gauge group, for example
$SO(10)$, is broken to the Standard Model gauge group by ``Wilson lines''. The
symmetry breaking by ``Wilson line'' has important implications. It gives rise
to exotic massless states which cannot fit into multiplets of the original
unifying gauge group. This is an important feature because it results in
conservation laws which forbid the interaction of the exotic ``Wilsonian''
states with the Standard Model states. The ``Wilsonian'' matter states then
have important phenomenological implications. I discuss two such implications:
exotic ``Wilsonian'' states as dark matter candidates and ``Wilsonian'' matter
as the messenger sector in gauge mediated dynamical SUSY breaking scenarios.

for massless case parity anomaly is absent at any finite density. This result
holds in any odd dimension as in abelian so as in nonabelian cases.

relates the gauge parameter dependence of Green functions to an enlarged
Slavnov-Taylor identity. In the course of the renormalization it turns out that
gauge parameter dependence of physical parameters is already restricted at the
level of Green functions. In a first step we consider the on-shell conditions
which we find to be in complete agreement with these restrictions to all orders
of perturbation theory. The fixing of the coupling, however, is much more
involved outside the complete on-shell scheme. In the Abelian Higgs model we
prove that this fixing can be properly chosen by requiring the Ward identity of
gauge invariance to hold in its tree form to all orders of perturbation theory.

quadratically with the size of the system and provides a physically transparent
representation of the force in terms of the spatial variation of the electronic
charge density. The method is based on a reciprocity theorem for evaluating an
effective potential acting on a charged ion in the core of each atom. We
illustrate the method with calculations for diatomic molecules.

superconductor both for $c$-axis and $ab$-plane electromagnetic wave
polarizations. The fluctuation contributions of different physical nature and
signs (paraconductivity, Maki-Thompson anomalous contribution, one-electron
density of states renormalization) are found to be suppressed by the external
field at different characterisitic frequencies ($ \omega_{\rm AL}\sim T-T_{\rm
c}$, $\omega_{\rm MT} \sim \max\{ T-T_{\rm c}, \tau_{\varphi}^{-1}\}$, $
\omega_{\rm DOS} \sim \min\{T,\tau ^{-1}\}$ for the $2D$ case). As a result the
appearance of the nonmonotonic frequency dependence (pseudogap) in the infrared
optical conductivity of HTS film is predicted. The effect has to be especially
pronounced in the case of the electromagnetic field polarization along
$c$-axis.
