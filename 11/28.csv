taken at McDonald Observatory and at Lick Observatory, have each independently
discovered periodic radial-velocity variations indicating the presence of a
Jovian-mass companion to this star. The orbital fit to the combined data gives
a period of 800.8 days, a velocity amplitude of 43.9 m/s, and an eccentricity
of 0.63. This is the largest eccentricity of any planetary system discovered so
far. Assuming that 16 Cygni B has a mass of 1.0 Msun, this implies a mass for
the companion of 1.5 sin i Jupiter masses. While the mass of this object is
well within the range expected for planets, the large orbital eccentricity
cannot be explained simply by the standard model of growth of planets in a
protostellar disk. It is possible that this object was formed in the normal
manner with a low eccentricity orbit, and has undergone post-formational
orbital evolution, either through the same process which formed the ``massive
eccentric'' planets around 70 Virginis and HD114762, or by gravitational
interactions with the companion star 16 Cygni A. It is also possible that the
object is an extremely low mass brown dwarf, formed through fragmentation of
the collapsing protostar. We explore a possible connection between stellar
photospheric Li depletion, pre-main sequence stellar rotation, the presence of
a massive proto-planetary disk, and the formation of a planetary companion.

Carlo event generators, Hadrin, Fritiof and Pythia, which simulate high-energy
proton-proton collisions and are widely used in studies of nuclear and particle
physics, in addition to scaling calculation. This study is motivated by the
result on the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray flux observed by the EGRET detector on
the Compton Gamma-ray Observatory, which indicates an excess above about 1 GeV
of the observed intensity compared with a model prediction. The prediction is
based on cosmic-ray interactions with interstellar matter, in which secondary
pion productions are treated by a simple model. With the improved interaction
model used here, however, the diffuse gamma-ray flux agrees rather well with
previous calculations within uncertainties, which mainly come from the
unobservable demodulated cosmic-ray spectrum in interstellar space. As a
possible solution to the excess flux, flatter spectra of cosmic-ray protons
have been tested and we found that the power-law spectrum with an index of
about $-(2.4\sim2.5)$ gives a better fit to the EGRET data, though the spectrum

the conductivity, between two arbitrary sites by exactly summing the
corresponding phase factors of all forward-scattering paths connecting them. An
analytic field-dependent expression, valid in any dimension, for the

turning on the magnetic field. In 2D, when the strength of B reaches a certain
value, which is inversely proportional to twice the hopping length, the MC is
increased by a factor of two compared to that at zero field. We also
investigate transport on the much less-studied and experimentally important 3D

small-field behavior of the MC vary according to the orientation of B. The
effect on the low-flux MC due to the randomness of the angles between the

two arbitrary point sources in general relativity have led to contradictory
arguments in the literature with respect to the condition of balance. Up to the
present time, the only known exact solutions which can be interpreted as the
non-linear superposition of two spherically symmetric (Reissner-Nordstrom)
bodies without an intervening strut has been for critically charged masses,
$M^2_i = Q^2_i$. In the present paper, an exact electrostatic solution of the
Einstein-Maxwell equations representing the exterior field of two arbitrary
charged Reissner-Nordstrom bodies in equilibrium is studied. The invariant
physical charge for each source is found by direct integration of Maxwell's
equations. The physical mass for each source is invariantly defined in a manner
similar to which the charge was found. It is shown through numerical methods
that balance without tension or strut can occur for non-critically charged
bodies. It is demonstrated that other authors have not identified the correct
physical parameters for the mass and charge of the sources. Further properties
of the solution, including the multipole structure and comparison with other
parameterizations, are examined.

physical mass spectra of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in 1+1 dimensions
are evaluated in the light-cone gauge with a compact spatial dimension. The
supercharges are constructed in order to provide a manifestly supersymmetric
infrared regularization for the discretized light-cone approach. By exactly
diagonalizing the supercharge matrix between up to several hundred color
singlet bound states, we find a rapidly increasing density of states as mass
increases. Interpreting this limiting density of states as the stringbehavior,
we obtain the Hagedron temperature $\beta_H=0.676 \sqrt{\pi \over g^2 N}$.
Secondly we have examined the vacuum structure of supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theories in 1+1 dimensions. SUSY allows only periodic boundary conditions for
both fermions and bosons. By using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for the
weak coupling limit, we find that the vacuum energy vanishes, and hence the
SUSY is unbroken. Other boundary conditions are also studied. The first part is
based on a work in collaboration with Y. Matsumura and T. Sakai. The second
part is based on a work in collaboration with H. Oda and T. Sakai.

evaluation of an integral which is invariant under rotation for SU(2) and
Lorentz transformation for SU(1,1). The integrals are accordingly evaluated by
applying a rotation to a unit position vector in SU(2) and a Lorentz
transformation to a unit SO(2,1) vector which is time-like for the elliptic
elements and space-like for the hyperbolic elements in SU(1,1). The details of
the procedure for the principal series of representations of SU(1,1) differ
substantially from those of the discrete series.

large-scale gyrokinetic simulations have become an important tool for improved
understanding of anomalous transport in tokamaks. Simulating the non-linear
behaviour requires solving for the perturbations of distrbution function in
five dimensions. We use a particle-in-cell approach to solve the equations via
the non-linear characteristic method. The code has been parallelized for a
variety of architecures (C90, CM-5, T3D) using a 1-D domain decomposition along
the torroidal axis, for which the number of particles in each cell remains
approximately constant. The quasi uniform distribution of particles, which
minimizes load imbalance, coupled with the relatively small movement of
particles across cells, which minimizes communications, makes this problem
ideally suited to massively parallel architectures. We present the performance
of the program as a function of number of processors and problem size, which
demonstrates the near perfect scalability of the code. In addition, we discuss
the scientific results obtained from the code and the types of problems that
will be addressable as the next generation of super-computers become available.

an adiabatic change of the trap shape.

measurements of the fluorescence from two four-level ions driven by a linearly
polarized laser were made. Depending on the polarization chosen, different
degrees of interference were observed. We carry out a theoretical and numerical
study of this system, showing that the results can largely be understood by
treating the atoms as independent radiators which are synchronized by the phase
of the incident laser field. The interference and its loss may be described in
terms of the difference between coherent and incoherent driving of the various
atomic transitions in the steady-state. In the numerical simulations, which are
carried out using the Monte Carlo wave function method, we remove the
assumption that the atoms radiate independently and consider the photodetection
process in detail. This allows us to see the total interference pattern build
up from individual photodetections and also to see the effects of
superfluorescence, which become important when the atomic separation is
comparable to an optical wavelength. The results of the calculations are
compared with the experiment. We also carry out simulations in the non
steady-state regime and discuss the relationship between the visibility of the
interference pattern and which-path considerations.
