4258 show that a massive black hole is present in its center (Miyoshi et al.
1995, Greenhill et al. 1995). We show that the evidence of ejection of gas,
radio plasma, and X-ray emitting QSOs from this nucleus all show that the
ejection is coming from the center in a curving flow within a cone with angle
~40 degrees, centered at P.A. 100 degrees. This is close to the direction in
which the velocities from the megamaser have been measured, so that the
evidence taken as a whole suggests that the masering gas also is being ejected
in the same direction at velocities +/- 900 km/sec and not rotating about a
massive black hole. Thus it does not provide evidence for a black hole in the
center.

the universal $A$ -- dependence of distorsions of a free nucleon structure
function by nuclear medium. The universality holds in the entire $x$ -range and
can be explained as a saturation of the distortions of the parton distributions
in a four-nucleon system.

including fermion masses and mixing angles, in SO(10) SUSY GUTs. Just as
precision electroweak data is used to test the Standard Model, the well
determined Standard Model parameters are the precision electroweak data for
testing theories beyond the Standard Model. In this paper we use the latest
experimentally measured values for these parameters. We study several models
discussed in the literature. One of these models provides an excellent fit to
the low energy data with $\chi^2 \sim 1$ for 3 degrees of freedom. We present
graphs of constant $\chi^2$ contours as functions of position in soft SUSY
breaking parameter space, as well as our predictions for a few selected points
in parameter space. We also study the sensitivity of our results to changes in
various parameters. Finally, we discuss the consequences of our work in the
context of a general MSSM analysis at the Z scale.

whose incompletion is a sign that both the mathematics and physics communities
do not yet completely understand the field. Here, we assemble results for
Euler/Zagier sums (also known as multidimensional zeta/harmonic sums) of
arbitrary depth, including sign alternations. Many of our results were obtained
empirically and are apparently new. By carefully compiling and examining a huge
data base of high precision numerical evaluations, we can claim with some
confidence that certain classes of results are exhaustive. While many proofs
are lacking, we have sketched derivations of all results that have so far been
proved.
