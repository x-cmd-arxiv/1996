contribute to accelerating positrons produced near the star surface in
conjunction with the radiative force. We reconsider the balance between energy
gains and losses, including inverse Compton (IC), bremsstrahlung and
non--radiative scatterings. It is found that, even accounting for IC losses
only, the maximum positron energy never exceeds $\approx 400$ keV. The
electrostatic field alone may produce energies $\approx 50$ keV at most. We
also show that Coulomb collisions and annihilation with accreting electrons
severely limit the number of positrons that escape to infinity.

  J. Phys. Chem. Sol",,"10.1016/S0022-3697(97)00025-5","VHS-1-96","cond-mat.supr-con",,"  The Van Hove singularity (VHS) provides a paradigm for the study of the role
of peaks in the density of states (dos) on electronic properties. More
importantly, it appears to play a major role in the physics of the high-T_c
superconductors, particularly since recent photoemission studies have found
that the VHS is close to the Fermi level in most of the high-T_c cuprates near
the composition of optimum T_c. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of the
VHS model, describing both theoretical properties and experimental evidence for
the picture. Special topics discussed include a survey of the Fermi surfaces of
the cuprates and related compounds, and an analysis of the reliability of the
slave boson approach to correlation effects.
  While many properties of the cuprates can be qualitatively understood by a
simple rigid-band-filling model, this is inadequate for more quantitative
results, since correlation effects tend to pin the Fermi level near the VHS
over an extended doping range, and can lead to a nanoscale phase separation.
Furthermore, the peaks in the dos lead to competition from other instabilities,
both magnetic and structural (related to charge density waves). A novel form of
dynamic structural instability, involving dynamic VHS-Jahn-Teller effects has
been predicted. Scattered through the literature, there is considerable
experimental evidence for both nanoscale phase separation of holes, and for
local, possibly dynamic, structural disorder. This review attempts to gather
these results into a comprehensive database, to sort the results, and to see
how they fit into the Van Hove scenario. Recent experiments on underdoped
cuprates are found to provide a strong confirmation that the pseudogap is
driven by a splitting of the VHS degeneracy.

octagonal very close to a square with predominately {111}-faceted steps. For
the (100) surface of fcc metals atomic migration proceeds by a hopping or an
exchange process. For Ag(100) we find that adatoms diffuse across flat surfaces
preferentially by hopping. Adatoms approaching the close-packed {111}-faceted
step edges descend from the upper terrace to the lower level by an atomic
exchange with an energy barrier almost identical to the diffusion barrier on
flat surface regions. Thus, within our numerical accuracy (approx +- 0.05 eV)
there is no additional step-edge barrier to descent. This provides a natural
explanation for the experimental observations of the smooth two-dimensional
growth in homoepitaxy of Ag(100). Inspection of experimental results of other
fcc crystal surfaces indicates that our result holds quite generally.

conjecture asserts the existence of a bijection between irreducible admissible
representations of GL(n,F) and n-dimensional admissible representations of the
Weil-Deligne group of F. This bijection is required to satisfy certain natural
compatibilities, of which the most important is compatibility with local
functional equations (preservation of L and epsilon factors of pairs). It is
enough to construct a bijection with these properties between supercuspidal
representations of GL(n,F) and n-dimensional irreducible representations of the
Weil group of F. In a previous paper, the author constructed a canonical
bijection on the etale cohomology of the rigid-analytic coverings of the p-adic
upper half space constructed by Drinfeld. (That the map in the previous paper
is a bijection was actually proved by Henniart.) However, the compatibility of
epsilon factors of pairs was not shown. The present article uses a technique of
non-Galois automorphic induction to show that the bijection previously
constructed is compatible with epsilon factors of pairs of representations of
GL(n,F) and GL(m,F) when n and m are prime to p (the tame case). This implies
the local Langlands conjecture in degree < p. It is also shown how the local
Langlands conjecture in general would follow from a generalization of Carayol's
theorem on the bad reduction of Shimura curves to certain Shimura varieties of
