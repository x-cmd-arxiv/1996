reduced by future observations. We find that the lens cannot be fit by an
isolated lens galaxy, but that it can be well fit by including a perturbation
from the nearby group of galaxies. To understand the full range of systematic
uncertainties it is crucial to use an ellipsoidal galaxy and to let the group
position vary. In this case, the existing constraints cannot break degeneracies
in the models with respect to the profiles of the galaxy and group and to the

galaxy position from 50 mas to \sim10 mas, reducing the uncertainties in the
time delays to \sim0.5 days, and constraining the lens mass distribution using
HST photometry and the fundamental plane. In particular, the time delay ratio

  the March 20, 1997 issue of ApJ",,"10.1086/303795",,"astro-ph",,"  The broadband X-ray spectrum of the prototypical starburst galaxy M82 is very
complex. At least three spectral components are required to fit the combined
ROSAT and ASCA spectrum in the 0.1--10 keV range. The observed X-ray flux in
this band is dominated by a hard Gamma = 1.7, heavily absorbed power law
component which originates in the nucleus and near-nuclear disk of the galaxy.
Among the candidates for the origin of this hard X-ray emission, the most
plausible appears to be inverse-Compton scattered emission from the interaction
of M82's copious infrared photon flux with supernova-generated relativistic
electrons. The measured intrinsic luminosity of the power law component agrees
closely with calculations of the expected inverse-Compton luminosity. Moreover,
the radio and X-ray emission in the nucleus of M82 have the same spectral
slope, which should be the case if both types of emission are non- thermal and
are associated with a common population of electrons. The other two spectral
components, thermal plasmas with characteristic temperatures kT = 0.6 and 0.3
keV, are associated with the star formation and starburst-driven wind in M82.
The warmer thermal component is heavily absorbed as well and must also
originate in the central region of the galaxy. The softer thermal component,
however, is not absorbed, and is likely to represent the X-ray emission which
extends along M82's minor axis. The amount of absorption required in the
three-component model suggests that the intrinsic luminosity of M82 in the
0.1--10 keV band is about four times greater than its observed luminosity of 4
x 10(40) ergs/s.

high O_2 pressures but not under usual ultra high vacuum conditions. The

the unusual catalytic behavior of Ru under elevated gas pressure conditions for

actuates the high rate, enabling CO_2 formation via both scattering of
gas-phase CO molecules as well as by CO molecules adsorbed at oxygen vacancies
in the adlayer, where the latter mechanism is expected to be very efficient due
to the relatively weak adsorption energy of both CO and O, as well as the close
proximity of these reactants. In the present paper we analyse the bonding and
electronic properties associated with the reaction pathway for CO_2 production
via the scattering reaction. We find that the identified ``bent'' transition
state is due to electron transfer into the unoccupied 2 pi orbitals of the CO
molecule which reduces the Pauli repulsion between the impinging CO and the
O-covered surface. Bond formation to CO_2 then proceeds by electron transfer
back from the CO 2 pi orbitals into the bonding region between CO and the

calculate ground state and excitation energies for finite sized lattices,
identify excitations as phonons and solitons on the basis of their quantum

dispersions for small $\hbar$, and remain similar all the way up to $\hbar=1$,
but then deviate substantially as we go further into the quantum regime. On
comparing the sound velocities for various $\hbar$ obtained thus with that
predicted by conformal theory we conclude that the Bethe ansatz gives the
energies per particle accurate to O($1/N^2$). On that assumption we can find
correlation functions. Thus the Bethe ansatz method can be used to yield much
more than the thermodynamic properties which previous authors have calculated.

contains no gauge condition imposed on gauge fields so that Gribov copying is
avoided. Configurations of gauge fields that turn into monopoles in the Abelian
projection can be classified in a gauge invariant way. In the continuum limit,
the theory respects the Lorentz invariance. A similar dynamical reduction of
the gauge symmetry is proposed for studies of gauge-variant correlators (like a
gluon propagator) in lattice QCD. Though the procedure is harder for numerical
simulations, it is free of gauge fixing artifacts, like the Gribov horizon and

explicit gauge condition imposed on gauge fields, is proposed. Under the
assumption that the results of numerical simulations holds in the continuum
limit, the monopole dominance is proved for the dynamical abelian projection.
The latter enables us to develop an effective scalar field theory for dominant
(monopole) configurations of gauge fields. The approach is manifestly gauge and
Lorentz invariant.

prototype model for analyzing the homoclinic tangle of symmetric dissipative
systems with \textit{symmetry breaking} disturbances. Even a slight fixed
asymmetry in the perturbation may cause a substantial change in the asymptotic
behavior of the system, e.g. transitions from two sided to one sided strange
attractors as the other parameters are varied. Moreover, slight asymmetries may
cause substantial asymmetries in the relative size of the basins of attraction
of the unforced nearly symmetric attracting regions. These changes seems to be
associated with homoclinic bifurcations. Numerical evidence indicates that
\textit{strange attractors} appear near curves corresponding to specific
secondary homoclinic bifurcations. These curves are found using analytical
perturbational tools.

matter, small lumps of strange quark matter (strangelets) and of hyperon matter
(metastable exotic multihypernuclear objects: MEMOs), with special emphasis on
their relevance for present and future heavy ion experiments. The masses of
small strangelets up to A = 40 are calculated using the MIT bag model with
shell mode filling for various bag parameters. The strangelets are checked for
possible strong and weak hadronic decays, also taking into account multiple
hadron decays. It is found that strangelets which are stable against strong
decay are most likely highly negative charged, contrary to previous findings.
Strangelets can be stable against weak hadronic decay but their masses and
charges are still rather high. This has serious impact on the present high
sensitivity searches in heavy ion experiments at the AGS and CERN facilities.
On the other hand, highly charged MEMOs are predicted on the basis of an
extended relativistic mean-field model. Those objects could be detected in
future experiments searching for short-lived, rare composites. It is
demonstrated that future experiments can be sensitive to a much wider variety
of strangelets.

8 carefully selected measurements can determine the four transversity
amplitudes without discrete ambiguities. That number of measurements is one
less than previously believed. We approach this problem in two distinct ways:
(1) solving for the amplitude magnitudes and phases directly; and (2) using a
bilinear helicity product formulation to map an algebra of measurements over to
the well-known algebra of the $4\times 4$ Gamma matrices. It is shown that the
latter method leads to an alternate proof that 8 carefully chosen experiments
suffice for determining the transversity amplitudes completely. In addition,
Fierz transformations of the Gamma matrices are used to develop useful linear
and nonlinear relationships between the spin observables. These relationships
not only help in finding complete sets of experiments, but also yield important
constraints between the 16 observables for this reaction.

interpreted as a quantum theory of information. Ur-objects, or urs, are thought
to be the simplest objects in quantum theory. Thus an ur is represented by a
two-dimensional Hilbert space with the universal symmetry group SU(2), and can
only be characterized as ''one bit of potential information''. In this sense it
is not a spatial but an ''information atom''. The physical structure of the ur
theory is reviewed, and the philosophical consequences of its interpretation as
an information theory are demonstrated by means of some important concepts of
physics such as time, space, entropy, energy, and matter, which in ur theory
appear to be directly connected with information as ''the'' fundamental
substance. This hopefully will help to provide a new understanding of the
concept of information.
