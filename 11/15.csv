additional effect which could be due to a systematic departure of the velocity
distributions of elliptical galaxies from a homologous family. In order to
distinguish between the different possible stellar populations parameters, the
FP and its projections can be observed at a range of redshifts. We describe
several such evolutionary tests: in the intercept of the color-magnitude

consistent with the population of cluster elliptical galaxies having formed at
high redshift; this contradicts large, systematic age variations as a
significant contributor to the slope of the FP.

sulphur abundance versus ([S II] + [S III])/Hbeta, similar to what has been
widely used for the more easily observable iso-electronic element oxygen. This
enables abundance determinations in extragalactic H II regions without
measurements of weak temperature sensitive lines for use in model calculations.
  As a first application of the empirical calibration 15 spectra covering the
wavelength range 3650-10000 AA have been obtained of H II regions at various
galactocentric distances in the spiral galaxy NGC 300, by employing specially
designed multiaperture slitmasks which allow simultaneous observations of
several H II regions. Sulphur and oxygen abundances are determined and an
oxygen gradient in agreement with previously published work is found as well as
a somewhat steeper sulphur abundance gradient. This results in a slight
decrease of log S/O with increasing radius.
  The quite low values of S/O seem to confirm the trend demonstrated by Diaz et
al. (1991) of a decrease in log S/O at high metallicities, but still more data
are needed before any definite conclusions can be drawn. We find as expected
that the radiation softness parameter eta decreases with increasing radius and
the slope is comparable to what is found for spiral galaxies of similar
metallicity.

example of two billiard systems, an elliptical billiard and a deformation of
it, an oval billiard. We derive a trace formula for the ellipse which involves
a uniform approximation for the Maslov phases near the separatrix, and a
uniform approximation for tori of periodic orbits close to a bifurcation. We
then examine how the trace formula is modified when the ellipse is deformed
into an oval. This involves uniform approximations for the break-up of tori and
uniform approximations for bifurcations of periodic orbits. Relations between
different uniform approximations are discussed.

compensating low density internal gas targets, or low reaction rates in

two-particle correlation function on the pair momentum K. This opens the
possibility to reconstruct the dynamics of the source from the K-dependence of
the measured HBT radii. Here we address the question to what extent resonance
decays can fake such a flow signal. Within a simple parametrization for the
emission function we present a comprehensive analysis of the interplay of flow
and resonance decays on the one- and two-particle spectra. We discuss in detail
the non-Gaussian features of the correlation function introduced by long-lived
resonances and the resulting problems in extracting meaningful HBT radii. We
propose to define them in terms of the second order q-moments of the correlator
C(q, K). We show that this yields a more reliable characterisation of the
correlator in terms of its width and the correlation strength `lambda' than
other commonly used fit procedures. The normalized fourth-order q-moments
(kurtosis) provide a quantitative measure for the non-Gaussian features of the
correlator. At least for the class of models studied here, the kurtosis helps
separating effects from expansion flow and resonance decays, and provides the
cleanest signal to distinguish between scenarios with and without transverse
flow.

fundamental questions in quantum mechanics. Recently, there has been work on
developing a consistent way of including constraints into the phase space path
integral that naturally arises in coherent state quantization. This new
approach has many advantages over other approaches, including the lack of any
Gribov problems, the independence of gauge fixing, and the ability to handle
second-class constraints without any ambiguous determinants. In this paper, I
use this new approach to study some examples of time reparameterization
invariant systems, which are of special interest in the field of quantum
gravity.
