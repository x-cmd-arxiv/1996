initial masses M_i=20 - 120 Msun (O3-B0 stars of all luminosity classes) are
used for a systematic study of the ionizing fluxes of O and early B stars. We
demonstrate the importance of accounting simultaneously for non-LTE effects,
line blanketing and stellar winds. The main results from our spectra are the
following: (1) The flux in the HeII continuum is increased by 2 to 3 (3 to 6)
orders of magnitudes compared to predictions from plane parallel non-LTE (LTE)
model atmospheres. (2) The flux in the HeI continuum is increased due to
non-LTE effects. However, we find that it is also influenced by wind effects.
The combined effect of a mass outflow and line blanketing leads to a flatter
energy distribution in the HeI continuum, which confirms the results of
Sellmaier et al. (1996) for a wider range of stellar parameters. (3) The flux
in the Lyman continuum is also modified due to line blanketing and the presence
of a stellar winds, although to a lesser degree than the spectrum at higher
energies. We derive revised ionizing fluxes for O3 to B0 stars based on the
recent Teff and gravity calibrations of Vacca et al. (1996). The total number
of Lyman continuum photons is found to be slightly lower than previous
derivations. Due to the increased flux in the HeI continuum the hardness ratio
of the HeI to H continuum is increased by 1.6 to 2.5 depending on spectral type
and luminosity class. A critical discussion of current model assumptions shows
that for stars of types later than B0, having weak stellar winds, reliable
predictions of ionizing fluxes are not yet possible.

  Relation","21 pages, Revtex, 8 PostScript figures included",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.55.7557","Imperial College CMTH 9697/2","cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  The Thouless conjecture states that the average conductance of a disordered
metallic sample in the diffusive regime can be related to the sensitivity of
the sample's spectrum to a change in the boundary conditions. Here we present
results of a direct numerical study of the conjecture for the Anderson model.
They were obtained by calculating the Landauer-B\""uttiker conductance $g_L$ for
a sample connected to perfect leads and the distribution of level curvatures
for the same sample in an isolated ring geometry, when the ring is pierced by
an Aharonov-Bohm flux. In the diffusive regime ($L\gg l_e$) the average
conductance $g_L$ is proportional to the mean absolute curvature $< |c| >$: $
g_L = \pi <| c | > / \Delta$, provided the system size $L$ is large enough, so
that the contact resistance can be neglected. $l_e$ is the elastic mean free
path, $\Delta$ is the mean level spacing. When approaching the ballistic
regime, the limitation of the conductance due to the contact resistance becomes
essential and expresses itself in a deviation from the above proportionality.
However, in both regimes and for all system sizes the same proportionality is
recovered when the contact resistance is subtracted from the inverse
conductance, showing that the ``curvatures measure the conductance in the
bulk''. In the localized regime, the mean logarithm of the absolute curvature
and the mean logarithm of the Landauer-B\""uttiker conductance are proportional.

various types of ""sudden switching"" problems in condensed matter physics such
as the X-ray edge singularity. We review this subject and give two extensions
of previous work. A general derivation of a connection between the X-ray edge
singularity, the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe and finite-size scaling of
energies is given. The formalism is also extended to include boundstates.

scattering data is used to calculate the interactions of pions in nuclear
matter as a function of nuclear density. Polarization of the nuclear medium by
the pions results in a marked increase in the s-wave $\pi\pi$ attraction at low
energy. The influence of this effect on the nucleon-nucleon interaction is a
corresponding increase with density of the $NN$ central potential due to the
exchange of two correlated pions, resulting in an $NN$ interaction which fails
to saturate. A possible mechanism for restoring the theoretical stability of
nuclear matter is explored and found to be effective.

Mermin. The new contradictions have some noteworthy features that did not
appear in the older ones.
