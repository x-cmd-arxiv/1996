falls in the range -1.1 < n < -1.6 on scales between 10 and 30h^{-1}Mpc. We
focus on differences between open models and the Einstein--de Sitter model, and
we exhibit a test which depends only on the cosmological parameter and is
insensitive to the shape of the initial fluctuations power spectrum: we show
that, contrary to what is generally admitted, the redshift distribution of
X-ray clusters selected on the basis of their apparent temperature is almost
independent of the power spectrum and that it is only sensitive to the value of
density of the universe. Since the relation between the virial mass and the
X-ray temperature seems rather robust, we expect very little theoretical
uncertainty in the modeling. This allows us to show that the combined knowledge
of the redshift distribution of X-ray flux selected clusters and that of the
luminosity-temperature correlation at high redshifts offers a new and efficient
way to measure the mean density of the universe. This appears to be a clean
test not suffering of the problems attached to local density estimators. We

comparing the theoretical temperature function with available data: the

observed number of clusters at high redshif ts. We also examine the
contribution of clusters to the X-ray counts and to the soft X-ray background

"cmp-lg/9611002","Carl de Marcken","Carl de Marcken (MIT)","Unsupervised Language Acquisition","PhD thesis, 133 pages",,,,"cmp-lg cs.CL",,"  This thesis presents a computational theory of unsupervised language
acquisition, precisely defining procedures for learning language from ordinary
spoken or written utterances, with no explicit help from a teacher. The theory
is based heavily on concepts borrowed from machine learning and statistical
estimation. In particular, learning takes place by fitting a stochastic,
generative model of language to the evidence. Much of the thesis is devoted to
explaining conditions that must hold for this general learning strategy to
arrive at linguistically desirable grammars. The thesis introduces a variety of
technical innovations, among them a common representation for evidence and
grammars, and a learning strategy that separates the ``content'' of linguistic
parameters from their representation. Algorithms based on it suffer from few of
the search problems that have plagued other computational approaches to
language acquisition.
  The theory has been tested on problems of learning vocabularies and grammars
from unsegmented text and continuous speech, and mappings between sound and
representations of meaning. It performs extremely well on various objective
criteria, acquiring knowledge that causes it to assign almost exactly the same
structure to utterances as humans do. This work has application to data
compression, language modeling, speech recognition, machine translation,
information retrieval, and other tasks that rely on either structural or
stochastic descriptions of language.

FCC(001) metal substrates is presented. The parameters of the model are
optimized to describe Cu diffusion on Cu(001), by comparing activation energy
barriers to a full set of barriers obtained from semi-empirical potentials via
the embedded atom method. It is found that this model (model I), with only
three parameters, provides a very good description of the full landscape of
hopping energy barriers. These energy barriers are grouped in four main peaks.
A reduced model (model II) with only two parameters, is also presented, in
which each peak is collapsed into a single energy value. From the results of
our simulations, we find that this model still maintains the essential features
of diffusion and growth on this model surface. We find that hopping rates along
island edges are much higher than for isolated atoms (giving rise to compact
island shapes) and that vacancy mobility is higher than adatom mobility. We
observe substantial dimer mobility (comparable to the single atom mobility) as
well as some mobility of trimers. Mobility of small islands affects the scaling
of island density $N$ vs. deposition rate $F$, $N ~ F^\gamma$, as well as the
island size distribution. In the asymptotic limit of slow deposition, scaling
arguments and rate equations show that $\gamma = i*/(2 i* + 1)$ where $i*$ is
the size of the largest mobile island. Our Monte Carlo results, obtained for a
range of experimentally relevant conditions, show $\gamma = 0.32$ for the EAM,
0.33 for model I and 0.31 for model II barriers. These results are lower than
the anticipated $\gamma >= 0.4$ due to dimer (and trimer) mobility.

admit a Hopf algebra structure are introduced, together with their Fock-type
representations and their corresponding $R$-matrices. It is also shown that a
class of generalized Heisenberg algebras including those algebras including
those underlying physical models such as that of Calogero-Sutherland, is
isomorphic with one of the types of boson algebra proposed, and can be
formulated as a Hopf algebra.

particular example of the scope of a class of non-linear maps introduced by us
recently.

$sl(2)$ is presented. This involves Jacobian elliptic functions. In our
deformation $U_{(h,k)}(sl(2))$, for $k^2=1$ one gets back $U_h(sl(2))$. The
constuction is presented via a nonlinear map on $sl(2)$. This invertible map
directly furnishes the highest weight irreducible representations of
$U_{(h,k)}(sl(2))$. This map also provides two distinct induced Hopf stuctures,
which are exhibited. One is induced by the classical $sl(2)$ and the other by
the distinct one of $U_h(sl(2))$. Automorphisms related to the two periods of
the elliptic functions involved are constructed. Translations of one generator
by half and quarter periods lead to interesting results in this context.
Possibilities of applications are discussed briefly.

atoms located at spatially-separated nodes of a quantum network. The
transmission protocol employs special laser pulses which excite an atom inside
an optical cavity at the sending node so that its state is mapped into a
time-symmetric photon wavepacket that will enter a cavity at the receiving node
and be absorbed by an atom there with unit probability. Implementation of our
scheme would enable reliable transfer or sharing of entanglement among
spatially distant atoms.

applied by Steinberg to the long-discussed traversal time problem. The
uncertainty and ambiguity that characterize this concept from the perspective
of von Neumann measurement theory apparently vanish, and joint probabilities
and conditional averages become meaningful concepts. We express the Larmor
clock and some other well-known methods in the weak measurement formalism. We
also propose a method to determine higher moments of the traversal time
distribution in terms of the outcome of a gedanken experiment, by introducing
an appropriate operator. Since the weak measurement approach can sometimes lead
to unphysical results, for example average negative reflection times and higher
moments, the interpretation of the results obtained remains an open problem.
