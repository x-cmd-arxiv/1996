shedding and the axially symmetric perturbations is studied. Numerical

under various assumptions concerning neutron star interior (large trapped

configurations with baryon mass well below the maximum one for the non-rotating

~10 below upper limits from previous EUVE observations of white dwarfs. In

decreasing $\Omega$ suppresses the small scale power in the density field and

gravitational lensing in 11 of the 12 clusters; the clusters span nearly an
order of magnitude in lensing strength. The sample thus provides an excellent
database for correlating direct mass estimates from lensing with indirect ones
which rely on baryonic tracers. We examine the correlation between the cluster
X-ray luminosities and the mean gravitational shear strengths and develop a
model which predicts the relationship expected from the properties of local
clusters. After allowing for various observational effects, we find that the
predicted correlation is a reasonable match to the available data, indicating
that there has been little evolution in the X-ray luminosity-central mass
relationship between z=0.4 and now. We discuss the implications of this result
in the context of the evolution of the X-ray luminosity function found by
earlier workers. The comparison between shear amplitudes and velocity
dispersions, estimated from a modest sample of members, reveals a discrepancy
in the sense that these velocity dispersions are typically over-estimated by
factors of ~50%. This supports earlier suggestions that high dispersions
measured for distant clusters may be seriously affected by both unidentified
substructure and outliers. Combining our lensing masses with
morphologically-based luminosity estimates, we determine mass/light ratios in
solar units of M/L_V=180+/-160 h for the entire population and 620+/-250 h for
the spheroidal galaxies where the evolutionary effects can be best treated. We
argue that this provides an upper bound to the local cluster M/L corresponding

for ``abnormal'' spectrum galaxies (i.e., post-starburst galaxies which have
strong Balmer absorption lines and emission line galaxies) in nearby clusters
that are similar to those found by Caldwell et al. (1993) in the Coma cluster.
Our primary conclusion is that 15% of the early-type galaxies in these nearby
rich clusters have signs of ongoing or recent star formation. Thus activity
similar to that seen in distant clusters is still ongoing, at a reduced level,
in present-epoch rich clusters. The frequency of such galaxies appears to be
enhanced significantly over that seen in field galaxies. Most of the new
post-starburst galaxies are disk galaxies; three E galaxies in one cluster and
one in another cluster have current star formation.
  We also find evidence in the spatial and kinematic structure of several of
the clusters that subclusters have recently passed through the main clusters
and are now emerging out the other side. If, as we suspect, the subclusters
passed through the main clusters more than 1 Gyr ago, then the post-starburst
timescales of 1 Gyr imply that the star formation bursts are only triggered
during (or after) the subcluster passage through the center of the main

This extension is especially useful for those problems which segment into
multiple sets of partially shared variables. Such problems arise naturally in
signal processing applications including computer vision, speech processing,
and handwriting recognition. For these applications, it is often difficult to
segment the data in only one way given the low-level information utilized by
the segmentation algorithms. MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent
several similar instances of the constraint satisfaction problem. If multiple
instances of a CSP have some common variables which have the same domains and
constraints, then they can be combined into a single instance of a MUSE CSP,
reducing the work required to apply the constraints. We introduce the concepts
of MUSE node consistency, MUSE arc consistency, and MUSE path consistency. We
then demonstrate how MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent lexically
ambiguous sentences and the multiple sentence hypotheses that are often
generated by speech recognition algorithms so that grammar constraints can be
used to provide parses for all syntactically correct sentences. Algorithms for
MUSE arc and path consistency are provided. Finally, we discuss how to create a

of ""spacetime information"" - the information available about a quantum system's
boundary conditions in the various sets of decohering histories it may display
- and investigates its properties. We note here that Hartle's analysis contains
errors which invalidate several of the conclusions. In particular, the proof
that the proposed definition agrees with the standard definition for ordinary
quantum mechanics is invalid, the evaluations of the spacetime information for
time-neutral generalized quantum theories and for generalized quantum theories
with non-unitary evolution are incorrect, and the argument that spacetime
information is conserved on spacelike surfaces in these last theories is
erroneous. We show however that the proposed definition does, in fact, agree
with the standard definition for ordinary quantum mechanics. Hartle's
definition relies on choosing, case by case, a class of fine-grained consistent
sets of histories. We supply a general definition of the relevant class of sets
that agrees with Hartle's definition in the cases explicitly considered and
that generalizes to other cases.

usual $\ell$-adic absolute value on $\Q$. Suppose $g(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty
c(n)q^n \in M_{k+\half}(N)$ is an eigenform whose Fourier coefficients are
algebraic integers. Under a mild condition, for all but finitely many primes
$\ell$ there are infinitely many square-free integers $m$ for which
$|c(m)|_\ell = 1$. Consequently we obtain indivisibility results for
``algebraic parts'' of central critical values of modular $L$-functions and
class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields. These results partially answer a
conjecture of Kolyvagin regarding Tate-Shafarevich groups of modular elliptic
curves. Similar results were obtained earlier by Jochnowitz by a completely
different method. Our method uses standard facts about Galois representations
attached to modular forms, and pleasantly uncovers surprising Kronecker-style
congruences for $L$-function values. For example if $\Delta(z)$ is Ramanujan's
cusp form and $g(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}c(n)q^n$ is the cusp form for which
$$L(\Delta_D,6)=\fracwithdelims(){\pi}{D}^6\frac{\sqrt{D}}{5!}\frac{<
\Delta(z),\Delta(z)>} {< g(z),g(z)>}\cdot c(D)^2,$$ for fundamental
discriminants $D>0,$ then for $N\geq 1$ $$\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty c(N-k^2)

interaction used in effective field theory (EFT) calculations of NN scattering
finite. This is done in both an effective field theory with explicit pions, and
one where the pions have been integrated out. In both cases we calculate NN
scattering in the ${}^1 S_0$ channel using potentials which are second-order in
the EFT expansion. The contact interactions present in the EFT Lagrangian are
made finite by use of a square-well regulator. We find that there is an optimal
radius for this regulator, at which second-order corrections to the EFT are
identically zero; for radii near optimal these second-order corrections are
small. The cutoff EFTs which result from this procedure appear to be valid for
momenta up to about 100 MeV/c. We also find that the radius of the square well
cannot be reduced to zero if the theory is to reproduce both the experimental
scattering length and effective range. Indeed, we show that, if the NN
potential is the sum of a one-pion exchange piece and a short-range
interaction, then the short-range piece must extend out beyond 1.1 fm,
regardless of its particular form.

not involve explicit photon fields in the low-energy effective theory. It is
pointed out that, if one followed the standard meson-exchange-model ansatz for
removing electromagnetic effects, i.e. of subtracting contributions associated
with explicit photon exchange and radiative corrections, as determined by the
photon coupling vertices of the effective hadronic theory, one would completely
miss these contributions and arrive at the erroneous conclusion that the strong
interactions exhibited very large isospin breaking in pi pi scattering.
Implications for electromagnetic ""subtraction"" procedures in other hadronic
systems and the utility of the effective Lagrangian method for avoiding such

$\pi\pi$, $K^+N$, $K \pi$ and $K\bar{K}$. As input we require results of phase
shift analyses. Quantum inversion Gelfand-Levitan and Marchenko single and
coupled channel algorithms are used for Schr\""odinger type wave equations in
partial wave decomposition. The motivation of this study comes from our two
approaches: to generate and investigate potentials directly from data by means
of inversion and alternatively use linear and nonlinear boson exchange models.
The interesting results of inversion are coordinate space informations about
radial ranges, strengths, long distance behaviors, resonance characteristics,
threshold effects, scattering lengths and bound state properties.

with special relativity and is motivated by recent interest in the relativistic
Stern-Gerlach force acting on polarized protons in high-energy particle
accelerators. The equations for the orbital and spin motion of a classical
charged particle with arbitrary intrinsic magnetic dipole moment in an external
electromagnetic field are considered and by imposing the constraints of special
relativity and restricting to first order in spin (= first order $\hbar$) a
well-defined class of spin-orbit systems is obtained. All these systems can be
treated on an equal footing including such prominent cases as those considered
by Frenkel and by Good. The Frenkel case is considered in great detail because
I show that this system is identical with the one introduced by Derbenev and
Kondratenko for studying spin motion in accelerators. In particular I prove
that the spin-orbit system of Derbenev and Kondratenko is (nonmanifestly)
Poincar\'e covariant and identify the transformation properties of this system
under the Poincar\'e group. The Derbenev-Kondratenko Hamiltonian was originally
proposed as a way to combine relativistic spin precession and the Lorentz
force. The aforementioned findings now demonstrate that the
Derbenev-Kondratenko Hamiltonian also provides a legitimate framework for
handling the relativistic Stern-Gerlach force. Numerical examples based on the
Frenkel and Good cases for the HERA proton ring and electromagnetic traps are
provided.
