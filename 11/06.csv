reasonable cosmological parameter choices. This suggests that the
characteristic time for which an AGN produces a highly collimated outflow that
powers the radio emission is shorter for the high-redshift sources than it is
for low-redshift sources. The fact that the characteristic time for which an
AGN produces a collimated outflow decreases with redshift implies that the
physical mechanism that gives rise to the large scale jets is not Eddington
limited. Higher redshift sources have higher radio powers due the flux limit of
the sample, and sources with higher radio powers have higher beam powers
relative to lower redshift sources. Both the beam power and active lifetime of
the AGN are controlled by processes occurring at the heart of the AGN, and may
be related for non-Eddington limited processes. The relation between the active

ground state. The ground state of the depleted model is either a spin singlet
or partially ferromagnetic reflecting topological properties of the depleted
sites. In order to show that the low-energy excitations are indeed massless, we
proceed our analysis in two different ways by resorting to effective field
theories. We first investigate an effective weak-coupling model in terms of
renormalization group methods. Although the tendency to massless spin
excitations is seen in the strong coupling regime, it turns out that the model
is still massive for any finite coupling, implying that a conventional
weak-coupling approach is not efficient to describe massless modes in our
model. To overcome this difficulty, we further study low-energy properties of
the depleted spin model by mapping on the non-linear sigma model, and confirm
that the massless spin excitation indeed occur.

faster decay gives much higher resolution of separation. We also propose a
modified screen containing an array of holes with barb-like protrusions running

developing the concept of higher order anisotropic superspace which unifies the

generalized Lagrange and Finsler geometry and leads to modelling of physical
processes on higher order fiber bundles provided with nonlinear and
distingushed connections and metric structures. The view adopted is that a
general field theory should incorporate all possible anisotropic and stochastic
manifestations of classical and quantum interactions and, in consequence, a
corresponding modification of basic principles and mathematical methods in
formulation of physical theories. The presentation is divided into two parts.
The first five sections cover the higher order anisotropic superspaces. We
focus on the geometry of distinguished by nonlinear connection vector
superbundles, consider different supersymmetric extensions of Finsler and
Lagrange spaces and analyze the structure of basic geometric objects on such
superspaces. The remaining five sections are devoted to the theory of higher
order anisotropic superstrings. In the framework of supersymmetric nonlinear
sigma models in Finser extended backgrounds we prove that the low-energy
dynamics of such strings contains motion equations for locally anisotropic
field interactions.

nuclei, the particle-rotor model (strong coupling limit of the core-particle
coupling model) has nevertheless been beset by a long-standing problem: It is
necessary in many cases to introduce an ad hoc parameter that reduces the size
of the Coriolis interaction coupling the collective and single-particle
motions. Of the numerous suggestions put forward for the origin of this
supplementary interaction, none of those actually tested by calculations has
been accepted as the solution of the problem. In this paper we seek a solution
of the difficulty within the framework of a general formalism that starts from
the spherical shell model and is capable of treating an arbitrary linear
combination of multipole and pairing forces. With the restriction of the
interaction to the familiar sum of a quadrupole multipole force and a monopole
pairing force, we have previously studied a semi-microscopic version of the
formalism whose framework is nevertheless more comprehensive than any
previously applied to the problem. We obtained solutions for low-lying bands of
several strongly deformed odd rare earth nuclei and found good agreement with
experiment, except for an exaggerated staggering of levels for K=1/2 bands,
which can be understood as a manifestation of the Coriolis attenuation problem.
We argue that within the formalism utilized, the only way to improve the
physics is to add interactions to the model Hamiltonian. We verify that by
adding a magnetic dipole interaction of essentially fixed strength, we can fit
the K=1/2 bands without destroying the agreement with other bands. In addition
we show that our solution also fits 163Er, a classic test case of Coriolis
attenuation that we had not previously studied.

Our results suggest that charged-current $\nu_e$ captures can be important in
breaking through the waiting-point nuclei at N=50 and 82, while still allowing
the formation of abundance peaks. Furthermore, after the r-process freezes out,
there appear to be distinctive neutral-current and charged-current
postprocessing effects. A subtraction of the neutrino postprocessing effects
from the observed solar r-process abundance distribution shows that two mass
regions, A=124-126 and 183-187, are inordinately sensitive to neutrino
postprocessing effects. This imposes very stringent bounds on the freeze-out
radii and dynamic timescales governing the r-process. Moreover, we find that
the abundance patterns within these mass windows are entirely consistent with
synthesis by neutrino interactions. This provides a strong argument that the
r-process must occur in the intense neutrino flux provided by a core-collapse
supernova.

that the standard implementation of the QCD sum rule method has only marginal
predicative power for the nucleon axial coupling constants, as the relative
errors are large. The errors range from approximately 50 to 100% compared to
the nucleon mass obtained from the same method, which has only 10% to 25%
error. The origin of the large errors is examined. Previous analyses of these
coupling constants are based on sum rules that have poor OPE convergence and
large continuum contributions. Preferred sum rules are identified and their
predictions are obtained. We also investigate the new sum rules with an
alternative treatment of the problematic transitions which are not

exponential suppression of their contributions relative to the ground state.
