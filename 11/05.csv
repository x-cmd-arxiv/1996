ASCA, WATCH/GRANAT and BATSE/CGRO, in the energy band from 1 keV to 2 MeV. Our

upper limit of 3.2 M$_{\sun}$ for a neutron star (the optical mass function for

on the methods which have been applied to HST observations of Cepheids. The
calibration of the period-luminosity relations is examined in detail and we
identify possible problems with the existing calibrations. New V- and I-band
period luminosity relations are presented based on a sample of 53 Cepheids in
the LMC with photometry drawn from the literature. These revised PL relations
result in a systematic decrease of approx 0.1 magnitudes in distance moduli
derived using the standard method of extinction correction. Hence estimates of
the Hubble constant based on such distances should be increased by $\sim5%$.
Other aspects of Cepheid distance determination, specifically incompleteness
bias, metallicity dependence, the effects of crowding and contamination of
samples by non-Cepheids are also discussed. We conclude that current HST
distance estimates to individual galaxies are probably good to about 10%, but
that much of this error is systematic. Efforts to reduce the systematics,
therefore, for example by improving the photometric calibration, refining the
distance to the LMC, and reobserving the Cepheid galaxies in the infrared with
NICMOS, will give large returns.

to form in the universe at earlier times than we currently probe. In Cold Dark
Matter (CDM) cosmologies, the first generation of baryonic objects emerges at
redshifts z=10-50. Here we examine the observable consequences of the
possibility that an early generation of stars reionized the universe and
resulted in the observed metallicity of the Lyman-alpha forest. Forthcoming
microwave anisotropy experiments will be sensitive to the damping of
anisotropies caused by scattering off free electrons from the reionization
epoch. For a large range of CDM models with a Scalo stellar mass function, we
find that reionization occurs at a redshift z>10 and damps the amplitude of
anisotropies on angular scales <10 degrees by a detectable amount, of order
10-25%. However, reionization is substantially delayed if the initial stellar
mass function transformed most of the baryons into low mass stars. In this
case, the mass fraction of pre-galactic stars could be constrained from the
statistics of microlensing events in galactic halos or along lines of sight to
quasars. Deep infrared imaging with future space telescopes (such as SIRTF or
the Next Generation Space Telescope) will be able to detect bright star
clusters at z>5. The cumulative Bremsstrahlung emission from these star
clusters yields a measurable distortion to the spectrum of the microwave

process in cosmic gases. In any volume where magnetized plasmas collide, the
dissipation of magnetic energy via reconnection seems to be unavoidable. Since
most cosmic plasmas are highly conductive, the magnetic field lines are
transported with the gas and no dissipation occurs for the most part of the
volume. This ideal frozen-in property of the magnetic field is broken in small
volumes if field gradients with different field polarity appear, in which
localized dissipative effects, e.g. anomalous resistivity, become important. On
the base of X-ray measurements exhibiting a clear connection of infalling
high-velocity clouds (HVC) with ROSAT ""hotspots"" we perform resistive
magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the capabilities of magnetic
dissipation as a major heating process in the interaction zone of the cloud
with the halo. The main result is that in the physical environment of a
galactic halo heating by externally driven magnetic reconnection cannot be
suppressed by thermal conduction and/or radiative cooling. Thus, the gas
reaches the maximum temperature given by the magnetic field pressure in the
interaction zone of the HVC with the galactic halo.

intermediate redshifts, we have begun a pilot survey to measure rotation curves
for blue, star-forming galaxies between 0.05<z<0.35. The scientific impetus for
such measurements is to construct internal velocity - luminosity relations at
redshifts substantial enough to make cosmological and evolutionary tests.
Departures from a fiducial relation as a function of redshift are sensitive to
both space-time curvature and the evolution of the mass-to-light ratio in
galaxies. Because of this ambiguity -- curvature vs. evolution -- kinematics
should be viewed as a new cosmological tool at intermediate redshifts to be
combined with additional measurements. In particular, the apparent internal
velocities, colors, surface-brightness, and image shape are all unaffected by
curvature, so that this ensemble of observables can be used unambiguously to
explore galaxy evolution. Here we discuss a well-defined method of target
selection which assures efficient measurement of spatially and spectrally
resolved kinematics, namely rotation curves. Spatial resolution is critical
since it is difficult to use integrated line-widths to distinguish between, for
example, a low-mass star-forming galaxy and a high-mass galaxy with a central
star-burst. For 18 of 19 appropriately selected galaxies to B<20.5 from
Bershady et al (1994), we have successfully measured rotation curves using the

star-forming galaxies reveals there is little evidence for evolution in the

surface-brightness test for other luminous galaxies indicates their luminosity
also is little changed to z~0.3. In this redshift regime, internal velocity --
luminosity relations like Tully-Fisher may provide a way to measure q0.
Discrepant results from several intermediate redshift Tully-Fisher surveys,
however, must be understood first. One possibility is that different surveys
sample different galaxy types and TF relations. Alternatively, M/L of some
spiral galaxies may evolve rapidly with look-back time. Larger surveys are
needed to resolve this issue. A different approach is to determine disk and
halo M/L separately. Such measurements, even at low redshift, would be
sensitive to the star formation histories of disks. We outline plans for
lambda/dlambda ~ 10000 integral-field spectroscopy of relatively face-on
spirals using the 9m Hobby-Eberly Telescope. Rotation curves and disk stellar
velocity dispersions can provide statistical information about the M/L of dark
halos as well as luminous disks.

find empirically an analytic approximation to the Sachs-Wolfe effect for all
crossing geometries and we derive an upper limit of $\approx$ 25 $h^{-1}$ Mpc
for the comoving radii of voids sitting on the LSS in order to achieve
compatibility with COBE's data. As a nearly empty void has an overcomoving
expansion of a factor of $\approx$ 4 between decoupling and the present, the
maximum allowed size at present is $\approx$ 100 $h^{-1}$ Mpc. On the other
hand, the smallness of the comoving size relative to the sound horizon reduces
strongly the adiabatic effect by Silk damping and makes it negligible. Most of
the signature of primordial voids comes therefore from metric effects and
consists of subdegree spots blue or red depending on whether the center lies
beyond or within the LSS. In conclusion we refine and confirm earlier
constraints on a power law void spectrum originated in an inflationary phase
transition and capable of generating the observed large scale structure.

  Series, in press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  A variety of high energy (>1 keV) spectra have been observed in recent years
from Black Hole (BH) and Neutron Star (NS) X-ray Binaries (XB). Some common
physical components exist between BHXBs and NSXBs, resulting in some high
energy spectral features. A common component between a BHXB and a weakly
magnetized NSXB is the inner accretion disk region extending very close to the
surface (for a NS) or the horizon (for a BH). The inner disk radiation can be
described by a multi-color blackbody (MCB) spectral model. The surface
radiation of the NS can be approximated by a Single Color Blackbody (SCB)
spectrum. For a strongly magnetized NSXB, the high energy emission is from its
magnetosphere, characterised by a thermal bremsstrahlung (TB) spectrum. In both
BHXBs and weakly magnetized NSXBs, a hot electron cloud may exist, producing
the hard X-ray power law (photon index -1.5 to -2.0) with thermal cutoff
(50-200 keV). It has been recently proposed that a converging flow may be
formed near the horizon of a BH, producing a softer power law (photon index
about -2.5) without cutoff up to several hundred keV. Based on these concepts
we also discuss possible ways to distinguish between BH and NS XBs. Finally we
discuss briefly spectral state transitions in both BH and NS XBs.

with 2\nf doublets; these are dual to SU(\nf-2) gauge theories whose
ultraviolet flavor symmetry is SU(\nf)xSU(\nf)xU(1) but whose flavor symmetry
is SU(2\nf) in the infrared. The infrared SU(2\nf) flavor symmetry is
implemented in the ultraviolet as a non-trivial transformation on the
Lagrangian and matter content of the magnetic theory, involving (generally
non-renormalizable) baryon operators and non-perturbative dynamics. We discuss
various implications of this fact, including possible new chiral fixed points
