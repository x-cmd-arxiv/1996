Geometric, which suffice to test separation and that reduce the problem to the
study of the behaviour of the semialgebraic sets in their boundary. Then we
derive several characterizations for the generic separation, among which there
is a Geometric Criterion that can be tested algorithmically. Finally we show
how to check recursively whether we can pass from the generic separation to the
separation of the two sets, yielding a decision procedure to solve the problem.

depths of eclipses are very rare in the volume-limited sample to 3 kpc: only 2
among 98 contact systems show the difference larger than 0.065 mag; for most
systems the difference is <0.04 mag. If this relative frequency of 1/50 is
representative, then one among 12,500 - 15,000 Main Sequence F-K spectral-type
stars is either a semi-detached or poor-thermal-contact system. Below the
orbital period of 0.37 day, no systems with appreciable differences in the
eclipse depths have been discovered. Since large depth differences are expected
to be associated with the ""broken-contact"" phase of the Thermal Relaxation
Oscillations, this phase must be very short for orbital periods above 0.37 day
and possibly entirely absent for shorter periods. In the full sample, which is
dominated by intrinsically bright, distant, long-period systems, larger
eclipse-depth differences are more common with about 9% of binaries showing
this effect. Sizes of these differences correlate with the sense of light-curve
asymmetries (differing heights of maxima) for systems with orbital periods
longer than 0.4 day suggesting an admixture of semi-detached systems with
accretion hot spots on cooler components. The light-curve amplitudes in the
full sample as well as in its volume-limited sub-sample are surprisingly small
and strongly suggest a mass-ratio distribution steeply rising toward more
dissimilar components. Many low mass-ratio systems remain to be discovered in

grow with the correlation length of the fluctuation. For MSW oscillations, the
leading effect for small fluctuations is to diminish the quality of the

probe of fluctuations deep within the sun. Fluctuations can also provide an

that follows next, pertains to two issues: (i) the need to remove the mismatch
between MSSM and string-unifications; and especially (ii) the need to resolve
naturally the problem of rapid proton decay, that generically arises in SUSY
unification. Seeking for a natural solution to this second problem, it is noted
that SUSY GUTS, including SUSY SO(10) and E_6, can at best accommodate
proton-stability by a suitable choice of the Higgs-multiplets and discrete
symmetries, but not really explain it, because they do not possess the desired
symmetries to suppress both d=4 and d=5 proton-decay operators. By contrast,
following a recent work, I argue that a class of string-solutions, possessing
three families, does possess the desired symmetries, which naturally safeguard
proton-stability from all potential dangers. They also permit neutrinos to have
desired light masses. This shows that, believing in supersymmetry, superstring
is needed just to understand why the proton is so stable.

effective as the Lyapunov exponent in measuring chaos. When applied to the QCD
parton showers, it is found that the quark jets are more chaotic than gluon
jets. The analysis is highly appropriate for a quantitative treatment of the

Calzetta and Hu on correlation histories we employ the Zwanzig projection

self-interacting scalar field theories. Our coarse-graining operation consists
in concentrating solely on the evolution of the correlation functions of degree
less than $n$, a treatment which corresponds to the familiar from statistical
mechanics truncation of the BBKGY hierarchy at the n-th level. We derive the
equations governing the evolution of mean field and two-point functions thus
identifying the terms corresponding to dissipation and noise. We discuss
possible applications of our formalism, the emergence of classical behaviour
and the connection to the decoherent histories framework.

"math/9611214",,"Tim Hsu","Class 2 Moufang loops, small Frattini Moufang loops, and code loops",,,,"MSRI 1996-079","math.GR",,"  Let $L$ be a Moufang loop which is centrally nilpotent of class 2. We first
show that the nuclearly-derived subloop (normal associator subloop) $L^*$ of
$L$ has exponent dividing 6. It follows that $L_p$ (the subloop of $L$ of
elements of $p$-power order) is associative for $p>3$. Next, a loop $L$ is said
to be a {\it small Frattini Moufang loop}, or SFML, if $L$ has a central
subgroup $Z$ of order $p$ such that $C\isom L/Z$ is an elementary abelian
$p$-group. $C$ is thus given the structure of what we call a {\it coded vector
space}, or CVS. (In the associative/group case, CVS's are either orthogonal
spaces, for $p=2$, or symplectic spaces with attached linear forms, for $p>2$.)
Our principal result is that every CVS may be obtained from an SFML in this
way, and two SFML's are isomorphic in a manner preserving the central subgroup
$Z$ if and only if their CVS's are isomorphic up to scalar multiple.
Consequently, we obtain the fact that every SFM 2-loop is a code loop, in the
sense of Griess, and we also obtain a relatively explicit characterization of
isotopy in SFM 3-loops. (This characterization of isotopy is easily extended to
Moufang loops of class 2 and exponent 3.) Finally, we sketch a method for
constructing any finite Moufang loop which is centrally nilpotent of class 2.

collisions of two heavy nuclei. We use initial conditions obtained from a
self-screened parton cascade calculation and, for comparison, from the HIJING
model. We consider a one-dimensional, as well as a three-dimensional expansion
of the parton plasma and find that the onset of the transverse expansion
impedes the chemical equilibration. At energies of 100 GeV/nucleon, the results
for one-dimensional and three-dimensional expansion are quite similar except at
large values of the transverse radius. At energies of several TeV/nucleon, the
plasma initially approaches chemical equilibrium, but then is driven away from
it, when the transverse velocity gradients develop. We find that the total
parton multiplicity density remains essentially unaffected by the flow, but the
individual concentrations of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons are sensitive to
the transverse flow. The consequences of the flow are also discernible in the
transverse momenta of the partons and in the lepton pair spectra, where the
flow causes a violation of the so-called $M_T$ scaling.

analogous to the electromagnetic field of a photon laser. Here I argue that for
this analogy to be meaningful it is necessary to have a precise definition of a
laser which applies equally to photon or atom lasers. The definition I propose
is based upon the principle that the output of a laser is well-approximated by
a classical wave of fixed intensity and phase. This principle yields four
quantitative conditions which the output of a device must satisfy in order for
that device to be considered a laser. While explaining these requirements, I
analyse the similarities and differences between atom and photon lasers. I show
how these conditions are satisfied first by an idealized photon laser model,
and then by a more generic model which can apply to atom lasers also. Lastly, I
briefly discuss the current proposals for atom lasers and whether they could be
true lasers.
