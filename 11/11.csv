computed using point mass approximations without considering any accretion

supermassive central black holes surrounded by accretion disks. These accretion
disks must be necessarily supersonic on and outside the horizon simply because
the radial velocity (in the corotating frame) has to be the velocity of light
on the horizon while the sound speed must be smaller. However, supersonic flows
are typically sub-Keplerian. Thus, smaller black holes and neutron stars (which
are on instantaneously Keplerian orbit and lose energy and angular momentum
through gravitational radiation) on their way to coalesce with the central
black hole must accrete negative angular momentum from the disk. We study here
the way these disks affect the gravitational wave emission.

clusters of galaxies. After identification of all cluster progenitors in the
simulations, we select those haloes which accrete directly onto the main
cluster progenitor. We construct the mass function of these merging satellites,
and calculate the main orbital parameters for the accreted lumps. The average
circularity of the orbits is epsilon = 0.5, while either radial or almost
circular orbits are equally avoided. More massive satellites move along
slightly more eccentric orbits, with lower specific angular momentum and a
smaller pericentre. We find that the infall of satellites onto the main cluster
progenitor has a very anisotropic distribution. This anisotropy is to a large
extent responsible for the shape and orientation of the final cluster and of
its velocity ellipsoid. At the end of the simulations, the major axis of the
cluster is aligned both with that of its velocity ellipsoid, and with the major
axis of the ellipsoid defined by the satellite infall pattern, to 30 degrees on
average. We also find that, in lower mass clusters, a higher fraction of the
final virial mass is provided by small, dense satellites. These sink to the
centre of the parent cluster and so enhance its central density. This mechanism
is found to be partially responsible for the correlation between halo masses
and characteristic overdensities, recently highlighted by Navarro, Frenk &
White (1996).

$U(1)_A$ as a horizontal symmetry for explaining the fermion mass and mixing
