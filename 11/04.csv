the cohomology of the configuration space of the complex line. This resolution
is S_n-equivariant. We apply it to the universal elliptic curve with complete
level structure of level N>=3 over the modular curve Y(N), obtaining a formula
for the S_n-equivariant Serre polynomial (Euler characteristic of H^*_c(V,Q) in
the Grothendieck group of the category of mixed Hodge structures) of the moduli

candidate (BHC) GX 339-4 using all 1 - 20 keV EXOSAT ME data: the July 1983,
March 1984, May 1984 and April 1985 observations. In April 1985 GX 339-4 was in
a weak low state (0.03E-9 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}, 2 - 10 keV). The X-ray spectrum
was a hard power law with a photon index \alpha of 1.82 and the power spectrum,
though ill-constrained by the data, was consistent with a typical BHC low state
spectrum. During the other three pointings the system was brighter (1.5E-9 erg
cm^{-2} s^{-1}, 2 - 10 keV), an ultrasoft component was present in the
spectrum, and the power law was steeper (\alpha ~3.5 in 1984; in 1983 it was
not well-measured); the power spectrum showed a flat-topped band-limited noise
component with a break frequency of ~4.5 Hz and a fractional rms amplitude of
~7%. Comparing flux levels, X-ray spectra and power spectra we conclude that in
these observations GX 339-4 was in a state intermediate between the usual BHC
low and high states. The system was ~4 times brighter than in its usual low
state, 4 times fainter than in its usual high state, and an order of magnitude
fainter than in its very high state. We compare these results to those recently
obtained on other BHCs, and conclude that this ``intermediate state'' behavior
is a common characteristic of BHCs, that occurs at $\dot M$ levels intermediate
between the high and the low state. We argue that this result can be used to
resolve the long-standing issue of the dependence of the power spectral break
frequency in the low state on mass accretion rate, and strengthens the idea
that low-state noise and very-high state noise may have a common origin. We
briefly discuss a possible interpretation for the changes in break frequency in
the low state and between low state and intermediate state.

redder than the old calibration (Sandage and Katem 1982) in the blue range, and
bluer in the reddest part of the CMD. This colour term has important
consequences on some issues (e.g. metallicity, period-shift effect, etc.). iii)
The metallicity derived from the photometric indicators (B-V)_{0,g} and \Delta
V_{1.4} is [Fe/H]~-1.45, i.e. significantly higher than the value -1.66
generally used so far. This is in very good agreement with the most recent high

of the presence of a very faint and blue extension of the HB, although scarcely

of vacuum polarisation on Compton scattering. Vacuum polarisation introduces a
characteristic density-dependent photon frequency at which the normal modes of
polarisation become nonorthogonal and the mean free path of photons decreases
sharply. Our analytic results and Monte Carlo simulations of photon propagation
through a magnetised plasma show that this effect leads, under a wide range of

the Standard Model, for example, to preserve the proton lifetime, to prevent
flavor changing neutral currents, etc. An important question is how can such
symmetries survive in a theory of quantum gravity, like superstring theory. In
a specific string model I illustrate how local discrete symmetries may arise in
string models and play an important role in preventing fast proton decay and
flavor changing neutral currents. The local discrete symmetry arises due to the
breaking of the non--Abelian gauge symmetries by Wilson lines in the
superstring models and forbids, for example dimension five operators which
mediate rapid proton decay, to all orders of nonrenormalizable terms. In the
context of models of unification of the gauge and gravitational interactions,
it is precisely this type of local discrete symmetries that must be found in
order to insure that a given model is not in conflict with experimental
observations.

this broad state to $\rho\rho$, $\omega\omega$, $K^*\bar K^*$ and $\phi \phi$

attributed to mixing between the glueball and the $s\bar s$ radial excitation.
The latter is pushed down in mass by repulsion between the two levels. We
conjecture that the $2^+$ glueball may likewise be broad. Mixing between it and
the $2^3P_2~q\bar q$ and $s\bar s$ radial excitation can explain the appearance
of $f_2(1565)$ and a $2^+$ $\Theta (1710)$ at masses lower than anticipated.
Mixing with higher $q\bar q$ states can explain the $2^+$ resonance at 1920 MeV

coalesce in the limit to become movable double poles of the solutions of P_I,
