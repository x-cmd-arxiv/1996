symmetry predicts relations amongst these observables, which are
model-independent consequences of Zhang's proposed symmetry-breaking pattern.

Then we specialize to the particular 6d theory that gives 5d Born-Infeld
theory. The field equation and Lagrangian of this 6d theory are formulated with
manifest 5d Lorentz invariance, while the remaining Lorentz symmetries are
realized nontrivially. A string soliton with finite tension and self-dual

  Order Anisotropic Superspaces (Hadronic Press, Palm Harbor, USA, 1998), pp.
  201-314",,,"hep-th dg-ga gr-qc math.DG",,"  We present a geometric approach to the field theory with higher order
anisotropic interactions. The concepts of higher order space, or locally
anisotropic, space (in brief, h-space, or la-space) are introduced as general
ones for various types of higher order extensions of Lagrange and Finsler
geometry and higher dimension (Kaluza-Klein type) spaces. The spinors on
h-spaces are defined in the framework of the geometry of Clifford bundles
provided with compatible nonlinear and distinguished connections and metric
structures (d-connection and d-metric). There are discussed some related issues
connected with the geometric aspects of higher order anisotropc interactions
for gravitational, gauge, spinor, Dirac spinor and Proca fields. The nearly
autoparallel maps are introduced as maps with deformation of connections
extending the class of geodesic and conformal transforms. We propose two
variants of solution of the problem of definition of conservation laws on
h-spaces. A general background of the theory of field interactions and strings
in spaces with higher order anisotropy is fromulated. The conditions for
consistent propagation of closed strings in higher order anisotropic background
spaces are analyzed. The connection between the conformal invariance, the
vanishing of the renormalization group beta-function of the generalized
sigma-model and field equations of higher order anisotropic gravity are studied
in detail.

can be established on the D1 line using the Zeeman sublevels of a given ground

means of a Hanle effect configuration. The efficiency of the coherent
population trapping phenomenon has been examined in presence of optical pumping
into hyperfine levels external to those of the excited transition. We show that
both the contrast and the width of the coherent population trapping resonance
strongly decrease when the optical pumping rate is increased. In the
experiment, the loss rate due to optical pumping has been controlled by means
of a laser repump of variable intensity.
