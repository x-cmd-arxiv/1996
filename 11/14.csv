  including figures",,,,"adap-org cond-mat nlin.AO",,"  An evolution equation for a population of strings evolving under the genetic
operators: selection, mutation and crossover is derived. The corresponding
equation describing the evolution of schematas is found by performing an exact
coarse graining of this equation. In particular exact expressions for schemata
reconstruction are derived which allows for a critical appraisal of the
``building-block hypothesis'' of genetic algorithms. A further coarse-graining
is made by considering the contribution of all length-l schematas to the
evolution of population observables such as fitness growth. As a test function
for investigating the emergence of structure in the evolution the increase per
generation of the in-schemata fitness averaged over all schematas of length l,
$\Delta_l$, is introduced. In finding solutions of the evolution equations we
concentrate more on the effects of crossover, in particular we consider
crossover in the context of Kauffman Nk models with k=0,2. For k=0, with a
random initial population, in the first step of evolution the contribution from
schemata reconstruction is equal to that of schemata destruction leading to a
scale invariant situation where the contribution to fitness of schematas of
size l is independent of l. This balance is broken in the next step of
evolution leading to a situation where schematas that are either much larger or
much smaller than half the string size dominate over those with $l \approx
N/2$. The balance between block destruction and reconstruction is also broken
in a k>0 landscape. It is conjectured that the effective degrees of freedom for
such landscapes are landscape connective trees that break down into effectively
fit smaller blocks, and not the blocks themselves. Numerical simulations
confirm this ``connective tree hypothesis'' by showing that correlations drop
off with connective distance and not with intrachromosomal distance.

that the observed trend can be brought about by a contaminating young

only account for a small fraction of the total mass, for example if a
contaminating population of age of 2 Gyrs is superimposed on an old (12 Gyr)
elliptical galaxy, then the observed trend can be explained if it contributes
only 10% to the total mass. The size of this effect is consistent with the

(PBH) formation and show that the standard Gaussian assumption, used in all PBH
formation papers to date, is not justified. Since large spikes in power are
usually associated with flat regions of the inflaton potential, quantum
fluctuations become more important in the field dynamics, leading to mode-mode
coupling and non-Gaussian statistics. Moreover, PBH production requires several
sigma (rare) fluctuations in order to prevent premature matter dominance of the
universe, so we are necessarily concerned with distribution tails, where any
intrinsic skewness will be especially important. We quantify this argument by
using the stochastic slow-roll equation and a relatively simple analytic method
to obtain the final distribution of fluctuations. We work out several examples
with toy models that produce PBH's, and show that the naive Gaussian assumption
can result in errors of many orders of magnitude. For models with spikes in
power, our calculations give sharp cut-offs in the probability of large
positive fluctuations, meaning that Gaussian distributions would vastly
over-produce PBH's. The standard results that link inflation-produced power
spectra and PBH number densities must then be reconsidered, since they rely
quite heavily on the Gaussian assumption. We point out that since the
probability distributions depend on the nature of the potential, it is
impossible to obtain results for general models. However, calculating the
distribution of fluctuations for any specific model seems to be relatively
straightforward, at least in the single inflaton case.

decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the
structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular
cosmology the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its
characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are
significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation which reflects
the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an
equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it
was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same
proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have
tested. We compare our results to previous work on halo density profiles and
show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic

useful broad band photometry. In fact, the STIS photometric system may be

cosmological models through the cosmological parameters. First, using the
angular diameter distance in the Friedmann-Lemaitre- Robertson-Walker universe,
we show that one can hardly determine $\Omega$ by this method without the
assumption of the spatially flat universe. We also investigate the effect of
inhomogeneities of the universe by using the Dyer-Roeder angular diameter
distance. It is shown that the effect of inhomogeneities can become too large

assumption that human language perception and production works with
representations of concrete past language experiences, rather than with
abstract linguistic rules. The models that instantiate this approach therefore
maintain large corpora of linguistic representations of previously occurring
utterances. When processing a new input utterance, analyses of this utterance
are constructed by combining fragments from the corpus; the
occurrence-frequencies of the fragments are used to estimate which analysis is
the most probable one.

thin film in the absence of an applied magnetic field. The resulting
zero-temperature resistance derives from two equally possible mechanisms: 1)
quantum tunneling of vortices from the edges of the sample; and 2) homogeneous
quantum nucleation of vortex-antivortex pairs in the bulk of the sample,
arising from the instability of the Magnus field's ``vacuum''. We study both
situations in the case where quantum dissipation dominates over the inertia of
the vortices. We find that the vortex tunneling and nucleation rates have a
very rapid dependence on the current density driven through the sample.
Accordingly, whilst normally the superconductor is essentially resistance-free,
for the high current densities that can be reached in high-$T_c$ films a
measurable resistance might develop. We show that edge-tunneling appears
favoured, but the presence of pinning centres and of thermal fluctuations leads
to an enhancement of the nucleation rates. In the case where a periodic pinning
potential is artificially introduced in the sample, we show that
current-oscillations will develop indicating an effect specific to the
nucleation mechanism where the vortex pair-production rate, thus the
resistance, becomes sensitive to the corrugation of the pinning substrate. In
all situations, we give estimates for the observability of the studied
phenomena.

a single system. Each probe pulse will cause a burst of fluorescence or no
fluorescence. If the probe pulses were strictly ideal measurements, the QZE
would predict periods of fluorescence bursts alternating with periods of no
fluorescence (light and dark periods) which would become longer and longer with
increasing frequency of the measurements. The non-ideal character of the
measurements is taken into account by incorporating the laser pulses in the
interaction, and this is used to determine the corrections to the ideal case.
In the limit, when the time between the laser pulses goes to zero, no freezing
occurs but instead we show convergence to the familiar macroscopic light and

holds also for quantum circuits which operate on nearest neighbors only. To
achieve this noise resistance, we use concatenated quantum error correcting
codes. The scheme presented is general, and works with all quantum codes that
satisfy some restrictions, namely that the code is ``proper''.
  We present two explicit classes of proper quantum codes. The first example of
proper quantum codes generalizes classical secret sharing with polynomials. The
second uses a known class of quantum codes and converts it to a proper code.
This class is defined over a field with p elements, so the elementary quantum
particle is not a qubit but a ``qupit''. With our codes, the threshold is about
