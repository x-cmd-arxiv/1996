two-dimensional plane (the Fundamental Plane of Elliptical Galaxies) in the
three dimensional space of effective radius, effective surface brightness and
central velocity dispersion. This observed clustering holds for galaxies
spanning several orders of magnitude in size and total brightness and residing
in a wide variety of environments. In order to understand the Fundamental Plane
(FP), it is important to know both why it should arise, and how it will evolve.
This contribution addresses the second of these, how the FP is likely to change
with time. In that context, we consider the evolution due to galaxy-galaxy
interactions, starting with arguments based upon the virial theorem, and a
discussion of the importance of understanding the mass-to-light ratio as a
function of position in the galaxies. The basic result of this argument is that
most of any global change in a galaxy due to a transformation (of whatever
cause) is mostly projected along the Fundamental Plane. A secondary point is
that if the change includes a substantial change in the mass-to-light ratio, a
galaxy can move across the FP, which could help explain the differences in
observational properties between the regular and dwarf galaxies.

extend the calculation into the mildly non-linear density regime found to
prevail at z = 3. Our work is based on a simple fundamental conjecture: that
the probability distribution function of the density of baryonic diffuse matter
in the universe is described by a lognormal (LN) random field. The LN field has
several attractive features and follows plausibly from the assumption of
initial linear Gaussian density and velocity fluctuations at arbitrarily early
times. Starting with a suitably normalized power spectrum of primordial fluc-
tuations in a universe dominated by cold dark matter (CDM), we compute the
behavior of the baryonic matter, which moves slowly toward minima in the dark
matter potential on scales larger than the Jeans length. We have computed two
models that succeed in matching observations. One is a non-standard CDM model
with Omega=1, h=0.5 and \Gamma=0.3, and the other is a low density flat model
with a cosmological constant(LCDM), with Omega=0.4, Omega_Lambda=0.6 and h=.65.
In both models, the variance of the density distribution function grows with
time, reaching unity at about z=4, where the simulation yields spectra that
closely resemble the Ly-alpha forest absorption seen in the spectra of high z
quasars. The calculations also successfully predict the observed properties of
the Ly-alpha forest clouds and their evolution from z=4 down to at least z=2,
assuming a constant intensity for the metagalactic UV background over this
redshift range. However, in our model the forest is not due to discrete clouds,
but rather to fluctuations in a continuous intergalactic medium. (This is an

function, alpha < -1.6, in this magnitude range. In Pegasus, the dwarf galaxy
density is too low to let us constrain alpha. The NGC 507 Group and Abell 194
have been interpreted as clusters that are forming today, based on morphology
and velocity structure. The high spiral galaxy fraction in Abell 262 relative
to clusters like Virgo and Coma also suggests that it is young. We therefore
suggest that steep luminosity functions in the range -14 < M_R < -10 may be a
universal feature of young clusters and possibly of the field. If this is true,
then the observed paucity of gas-rich galaxies in such environments suggests
that we are finding galaxies similar to the low-surface-brightness,
dark-matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal galaxies seen locally and in Virgo. This
interpration is also consistent with the distribution of colors and sizes of
the faint galaxies in Abell 262. If we are indeed detecting dwarf spheroidal
galaxies and if they are as numerous relative to bright galaxies in the field
as they are in the young clusters observed here, then the contribution of their
halos to the cosmological mass density is Omega_{dSph halo} \approx 0.01. This
is much smaller than values of Omega derived from dynamical measurements.

predicted by droplet theory: the specific mechanism by which switching occurs
depends on the structure of the boundary, the particle size, the temperature,

peak in the switching field as a function of system size in both systems with
periodic boundary conditions and in systems with boundaries. The size of the
peak is strongly dependent on the boundary effects. It is generally reduced by
open boundary conditions, and in some cases it disappears if the boundaries are
too favorable towards nucleation. However, we also demonstrate conditions under
which the peak remains discernible. This peak arises as a purely dynamic effect
and is not related to the possible existence of multiple domains. We illustrate
the predictions of droplet theory by Monte Carlo simulations of two-dimensional

$T_{\theta }$ and $T_{F}$ are the equilibrium collapse and folding transition
temperatures, respectively. The microscopic dynamics reveals several scenarios
for the refolding kinetics depending on the values of $\sigma $. Proteins with
small $\sigma $ reach the native conformation via a nucleation collapse
mechanism and their energy landscape is characterized by single dominant native
basin of attraction. Proteins with large $\sigma $ get trapped in competing
basins of attraction, in which they adopt misfolded structures. In this case
only a small fraction of molecules $\Phi $ access the native state rapidly, the
majority of them approach the native state by a three stage multipathway
mechanism. The partition factor $\Phi $ is determined by $\sigma $: smaller the
value of $\sigma $ larger is $\Phi $. The qualitative aspects of our results
are found to be independent of the friction coefficient. Estimates for time
scales for folding of small proteins via a nucleation collapse mechanism are
presented.

coherence for inhomogeneous perturbations generated from a non-vacuum initial

explicitly that these three approaches lead to the same prediction in the limit
of large squeezing (i.e. when the squeezing parameter $|r_k|\to \infty$): each
two-modes quantum state (k, -k) of these perturbations is equivalent to a
classical perturbation that has a stochastic amplitude, obeying a non-gaussian
statistics which depends on the initial state, and that belongs to the
quasi-isotropic mode (i.e. it possesses a fixed phase). The Wigner function is
not everywhere positive for any finite $r_k$, hence its interpretation as a
classical distribution function in phase space is impossible without some
coarse graining procedure. However, this does not affect the transition to
semiclassical behaviour since the Wigner function becomes concentrated near a
classical trajectory in phase space when $|r_k|\to \infty$ even without coarse
graining. Deviations of the statistics of the perturbations in real space from
a Gaussian one lie below the cosmic variance level for the N-particles initial
states with N=N(|k|) but may be observable for other initial states without
statistical isotropy or with correlations between different k modes. As a way
to look for this effect, it is proposed to measure the kurtosis of the angular
fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background temperature.

angle theta and the gravitino mass m_{3/2}. This fact will help us in studying
the modification of the supersymmetric magnetic moments sum rules which are
very sensitive to the supersymmetry breaking. We write these rules in case of
exact supersymmetry in a form close to the supersymmetric mass relations,
namely $ \sum_J (-1)^{(2J)} (2 J) A_J=0$, where A_J is the anomalous magnetic

to non-static backgrounds in 11-dimensional theory. The 11-d counterpart of the

gravitational wave propagating along a generic cycle of 2-torus. The extremal

to the string-string solution we find type IIA background representing a bound
state of 2-brane and 0-brane. Its lift to 11 dimensions is simply a 2-brane
finitely boosted in transverse direction. This 11-d solution interpolates
between a static 2-brane (zero boost) and a gravitational wave in 11-th

states involving 5-branes. Relations between transversely boosted M-branes and
1/2 supersymmetric non-threshold bound states 2+0 and 5+0 complement relations

establish the correspondence between the BPS states of type IIB strings on a

$q$ a root of unity, which are finite dimensional. Among others, unitary \reps
corresponding to all classical one-particle representations with integral
weights are found for $q = e^{i \pi /M}$, with $M$ being large enough. In the
""massless"" case with spin bigger than or equal to 1 in 4 dimensions, they are
unitarizable only after factoring out a subspace of ""pure gauges"", as
classically. A truncated associative tensor product describing unitary
many-particle representations is defined for $q = e^{i\pi /M}$.

  additions in section IV/K (particle spin) to improve on readability and
  conciseness (only verbal)",,,,"quant-ph hep-th",,"  The wave-structure of moving electrons is analyzed on a fundamental level by
employing a modified de Broglie relation. Formalizing the wave-function $\psi$
in real notation yields internal energy components due to mass oscillations.
The wave-features can then be referred to physical waves of discrete frequency
$\nu$ and the classical dispersion relation $\lambda \nu = u $, complying with
the classical wave equation. Including external potentials yields the
Schr\""odinger equation, which, in this context, is arbitrary due to the
internal energy components. It can be established that the uncertainty
relations are an expression of this, fundamental, arbitrariness. Electrons and
photons can be described by an identical formalism, providing formulations
equivalent to the Maxwell equations. The wave equations of intrinsic particle
properties are Lorentz invariant considering total energy of particles,
although transformations into a moving reference frame lead to an increase of
intrinsic potentials. Interactions of photons and electrons are treated
extensively, the results achieved are equivalent to the results in quantum
theory. Electrostatic interactions provide, a posteriori, a justification for
the initial assumption of electron-wave stability: the stability of electron
waves can be referred to vanishing intrinsic fields of interaction. The concept
finally allows the conclusion that a significant correlation for a pair of spin
particles in EPR--like measurements is likely to violate the uncertainty
relations.

  PhysComp96, eventually to appear in special issue of Physica D",,,"BOCK-1","quant-ph",,"  The engine that powers quantum cryptography is the principle that there are
no physical means for gathering information about the identity of a quantum
system's state (when it is known to be prepared in one of a set of
nonorthogonal states) without disturbing the system in a statistically
detectable way. This situation is often mistakenly described as a consequence
of the ``Heisenberg uncertainty principle.'' A more accurate account is that it
is a unique feature of quantum phenomena that rests ultimately on the Hilbert
space structure of the theory along with the fact that time evolutions for
isolated systems are unitary. In this paper we shall explore several aspects of
the information--disturbance principle in an attempt to make it firmly
quantitative and flesh out its significance for quantum theory as a whole.
