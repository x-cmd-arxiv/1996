the photoionizing UV background spectrum computed by Haardt & Madau (1996). The
simulated gas distribution, combined with the H&M spectral shape, accounts for
the relative observed values of taubar_HI and taubar_HeII, the effective mean
optical depths for HI and HeII absorption. If the background intensity is as
high as H&M predict, then matching the absolute values of taubar_HI and
taubar_HeII requires a baryon abundance larger (by factors between 1.5 and 3
for the various CDM models) than our assumed value of Omega_b h^2=0.0125. The
simulations reproduce the evolution of taubar_heII over the observed redshift
range, 2.2 < z < 3.3, if the HeII photoionization rate remains roughly
constant. HeII absorption in the CDM simulations is produced by a diffuse,
fluctuating, intergalactic medium, which also gives rise to the HI ly-alpha
forest. Much of the HeII opacity arises in underdense regions where the HI
optical depth is very low. We compute statistical properties of the HeII and HI
absorption that can be used to test the CDM models and distinguish them from an
alternative scenario in which the HeII absorption is caused by discrete,
compact clouds. The CDM scenario predicts that a substantial amount of baryonic
material resides in underdense regions at high redshift. HeII absorption is the
only sensitive probe of such extremely diffuse, intergalactic gas, so it can
provide a vital test of this fundamental prediction.

numerical methods, different implementations of the gravitational wave
backreaction, and different equations of state. Comparison (a) confronts the
results of our grid-based PPM scheme with those from an SPH code. We found that
due to the lower numerical viscosity of the PPM code, the post-merging
oscillations and pulsations could be followed for a longer time and lead to
larger secondary and tertiary maxima of the gravitational wave luminosity. In
case (b) two grid based codes with the same backreaction formalism but
differing hydrodynamic integrators and different numerical resolution are
compared. Satisfactory agreement of the amplitude of the gravitational wave
luminosity is established, although due to the different initial conditions a
small time delay develops in the onset of the dynamical instability. In (c) we
find that using a polytropic equation of state instead of the high-density
equation of state of Lattimer & Swesty (1991) does not change the overall
dynamical evolution of the merger and yields agreement of the gravitational
wave signature to within 20% accuracy. However, differences of the structure
and evolution of the outer layers of the neutron stars are present, which has
important implications for questions like mass loss and disk formation during

north-west, as originally described by Allen & Burton (1993); a fainter
counter-finger to the south-east is newly discovered in the present data. While
the outflow appears to be broadly bipolar, this is probably due to an
interaction between an initially spherical wind from the source and a
large-scale density enhancement surrounding it, rather than direct collimation
imposed close to the source. The clumpy appearance of the inner shell confirms
the prediction of the recent model of Stone, Xu, & Mundy (1995), in which a
spherical and time-varying wind fragments a swept-up shell, producing
high-velocity shrapnel, which in turn drives bow-shocks into the surrounding
gas, resulting in the observed ""fingers"". As an alternative to the single
varying source proposed by Stone et al., we speculate that several young

$p=0$, we first derive the growth law for the average size of the cluster as
well as a formula for its mass density profile. For $p>0$, we carry out
extensive simulations on fibers, and also needles and disks to study the
dependence of the percolation threshold on $p$. We also derive a mean-field
theory for the threshold near $p=0$ and $p=1$ and find good qualitative
agreement with the simulations. The fiber networks produced by the model
display nontrivial density correlations for $p<1$. We study these by deriving
an approximate expression for the pair distribution function of the model that
reduces to the exactly known case of a uniformly random network. We also show
that the two-point mass density correlation function of the model has a

us with a phenomenological understanding of the interplay between the frequency

the memory function is calculated via its moments and shown to project out the

disagree with QCD predictions, occasionally by well over one order of
magnitude, is that the traditional method for performing the perturbative
calculation of the cross section is simply wrong. The key mistake is to require
that the heavy quark pair forms a color singlet at short distances, given that
there is an infinite time for soft gluons to readjust the color of the $c \bar
c$ pair before it appears as an asymptotic $\psi$ or, alternatively, $D \bar D$
state. We suspect that the same mistake is made in the description of rapidity
gaps, i.e.\ the production of a color-neutral quark-antiquark pair, in terms of
the exchange of a color neutral gluon pair. The $\psi$ is after all a color
neutral $c \bar c$ pair and we will show that it is produced by the same
dynamics as $D \bar D$ pairs; its color happens to be bleached by soft
final-state interactions. This approach to color is suggestive of the
unorthodox prescription for the production of rapidity gaps in deep inelastic
scattering, proposed by Buchm\""uller and Hebecker. When applied to the
formation of gaps between a pair of high transverse momentum jets in hadron
collisions, the soft color approach suggests a formation rate of gaps in
gluon-gluon subprocesses which is similar or smaller than in quark-quark
induced events. Formation of gaps should increase when increasing transverse
momentum or lowering energy, in contrast with 2-gluon exchange Pomeron models.

Condensate (DCC) are obtained numerically, in the context of the $SU(2)_L

ignore the mass terms in the Lagrangian, as we are mainly interested in the
behavior of the solutions for small values of proper time $\tau$. The solutions
obtained at O(p^4) are matched to those of O(p^2) at a late proper time $\tau
\gg 1/m_\pi$, where $m_\pi = 140$ MeV is the mass of the pion. We find that at
O(p^4) the solutions for the DCC do not have singular behavior at early proper
times $\tau \ll 1/m_\pi$. The solutions indicate that for $\tau \lsim
(0.5-0.8)$ fm the O(p^4) corrections become important. We take the sizes of the
field derivatives to be indicators of the validity of the momentum expansion.
Thus, we deduce that the O(p^4) solutions can be used to represent the
qualitative behavior of the DCC down to proper times of about 0.2 fm. Since
below $\sim 0.2$ fm the formalism is not reliable, we conclude that the
inclusion of higher order terms beyond O(p^4) is not needed to extend the
validity of the solutions to earlier proper times.

rotational bands is investigated in a single-j shell model. An exact
shell-model diagonalization of quadrupole-plus-hexadecapole interaction can
sometimes produce a staggering of energy levels in the yrast bands.

  substantially re-written with new results added",,,,"math-ph hep-th math.MP quant-ph",,"  Hilbert Spaces of bounded one dimensional non-linear oscillators are studied.
It is shown that the eigenvalue structure of all such oscillators have the same
general form. They are dependent only on the ground state energy of the system
and a single functional $\lambda(H)$ of the Hamiltonian $H$ whose form depends
explicitly on $H$. It is also found that the Hilbert Space of the non-linear
oscillator is unitarily inequivalent to the Hilbert Space of the simple
harmonic oscillator, providing an explicit example of Haag's Theorem. A number
operator for the nonlinear oscillator is constructed and the general form of
the partition function and average energy of an non-linear oscillator in
contact with a heat bath is determined. Connection with the WKB result in the
semi-classical limit is made. This analysis is then applied to the specific
case of the $x^4$ anharmonic oscillator.

single trapped mode of a cold, dilute, weakly interacting Bose gas; and we
obtain an operator fluctuation-dissipation relation in which the
Ginzburg-Landau effective potential plays a physically transparent role. We
also identify a decoherence effect that tends to preserve symmetry, even when
the effective potential has a ``Mexican hat'' form.

asymmetric limit of the three colouring model on the honeycomb lattice. The
latter model is known to be the O(n) model at T=0 and corresponds to the
integrable model connected to the affine $A_2^{(1)}$ Lie algebra. Thus it is
shown that the weights of the square-triangle random tiling satisfy the
Yang-Baxter equation, albeit in a singular limit of a more general model. The
three colouring model for general vertex weights is solved by algebraic Bethe
Ansatz.
