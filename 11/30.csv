  Arnobaldi, G. S. Da Costa & P. Saha",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We consider the general theoretical problem of ultraviolet light from old
stellar populations (t > 2 Gyr), and the interpretation of galaxy spectra at
short wavelengths (lamda < 3200A) The sources believed to be responsible for
the observed `ultraviolet upturn phenomenon' (UVX) are Post-AGB (P-AGB),
extreme horizontal branch (EHB) and AGB-Manque (AGBM) stars. The production of
EHB stars depends on mass loss on the red giant branch, which is poorly
understood, making the far-UV flux problematical as an indicator of the gross
properties, such as the age, of a given galaxy. We discuss the current state of
the comparison between theory and observation for the UVX phenomenon, and
revisit the interpretation of the well-known UVX-Mg2 correlation. In
particular, we draw attention to the fact that the UVX appears not to be
correlated with indices that measure the iron abundance, which has implications
for models that explain the UV-Mg2 correlation as an abundance-driven effect.
Finally, we note the potential utility of ultraviolet observations in
distinguishing age and metallicity from galaxy spectral energy distributions.

The 94 luminous ellipticals ($M_{AB}(B)<-20$; selected by morphology alone with
no reference to color) form tight sequences in the size-luminosity plane. The
position of these sequences shifts, on average, with redshift so that an object
of a given size at z=0.55 is brighter by $\Delta M(B)=-0.57 \pm 0.13$ mag than
its counterpart (measured with the same techniques) in nearby clusters. At
z=0.9 the shift is $\Delta M(B)=-0.96 \pm 0.22$ mag. If the relation between
size and luminosity is universal so that the local cluster galaxies represent
the evolutionary endpoints of those at high redshift, and if the
size-luminosity relation is not modified by dynamical processes then this
population of galaxies has undergone significant luminosity evolution since z=1
consistent with expectations based on models of passively evolving, old stellar

effective equations governing the transport at scales large compared to those
of the advecting flow are derived by using multi-scale techniques. Ballistic
transport generally takes place when both the solenoidal and the potential
components of the velocity do not vanish, despite of the fact that it has zero
average value. The calculation of the effective ballistic velocity $V_b$ is
reduced to the solution of one auxiliary equation. An analytic expression for
$V_b$ is derived in some special instances, i.e. flows depending on a single
coordinate, random with short correlation times and slightly compressible
cellular flow. The effective mean velocity $V_b$ vanishes for velocity fields
which are either incompressible or potential and time-independent. For generic
compressible flow, the most general conditions ensuring the absence of
ballistic transport are isotropy and/or parity invariance. When $V_b$ vanishes
(or in the frame of reference moving with velocity $V_b$), standard diffusive
transport takes place. It is known that diffusion is always enhanced by
incompressible flow. On the contrary, we show that diffusion is depleted in the
presence of time-independent potential flow. Trapping effects due to potential
wells are responsible for this depletion. For time-dependent potential flow or
generic compressible flow, transport rates are enhanced or depleted depending
on the detailed structure of the velocity field.

Bond-order studies show that the lowest two-photon state corresponds to a
localized excitation while one-photon and triplet excitations are extended in
nature. The bipolaronic state shows clear evidence for charge separation and
disproportionation into two polarons. We find that the extended nature of
one-photon and triplet states of neutral system are very similar to those of
