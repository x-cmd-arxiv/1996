  figures",,"10.1093/mnras/287.3.543",,"astro-ph",,"  The deprojection of the surface brightness of axisymmetric galaxies is
indeterminate unless the galaxy is seen edge-on. In practice, this problem is
often circumvented by making ad hoc assumptions about the density distribution.
However, one can redistribute the density and still project to the same surface
brightness. This is similar to adding so-called konus densities to the assumed
density distribution. In this paper we investigate the maximum konus density
that one can add to elliptical galaxies. In particular we focus on the
uncertainties in the central densities of axisymmetric, (cusped) elliptical
galaxies due to the non-uniqueness of the deprojection. In order to estimate
the dynamical influence of konus densities on the central region, we calculate
the mass fraction they can add to the center. We show that this mass fraction
is at most a few percent. We also investigate the dynamical effect of cusped
konus densities We show that konus densities can only be moderately cusped, and
that an increase in cusp slope results in a decrease of the mass fraction added
to the center by the konus density. We illustrate all this by the specific
example of M32, and show that the uncertainty in the central mass due to
deprojection is negligible compared to the inferred mass of the central black
hole (BH) in this galaxy.

consider various examples, including the generalised reduction of M-theory and

  The subgroup~$\GOS$ may be a proper subgroup of~$\Ga_S$ for only two reasons.
First, it is well known that $\Ga_{\theints}$ is not a lattice in~$\Ga_S$ if
$\Ga$ has nontrivial $K$-characters, so one passes to a certain subgroup $\GS$.
Second, $\Ga_{\theints}$ may fail to be Zariski dense in $\GS$ in an
appropriate sense; in this sense, the subgroup $\GOS$ is the Zariski closure
of~$\Ga_{\theints}$ in~$\GS$.

direct decays. Introducing a decrease of vector meson masses in hot and dense
