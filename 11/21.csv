obtained with ASCA and ROSAT. Our main goal was to see if there is a difference
in the elemental abundances of active stars between young and more evolved
objects. A two temperature plasma with subsolar abundances, of the order of Z =
0.15 - 0.3, is required to fit the SIS spectra. Similar results are obtained
from a ROSAT PSPC observation. Metal abundances of 0.2 - 0.4 the solar value
are required to fit both the ASCA and ROSAT data together. From a simultaneous
SIS0+SIS1 spectral fit, with 2T plasma models and abundances free to vary in
non-solar proportions, we find that, besides N, O and Ne for which we find very
low values, all other elements have values relative to solar abundances around
0.2-0.3. These subsolar abundances are in line with those typically observed in
more evolved, active stars like RS CVn and Algol-type binaries. The two
temperature values required to fit the ASCA SIS spectra are about 0.5 and 1.0
keV. These temperatures, especially the higher one, are lower with respect to
the values found for the RS CVn and Algol binaries or for the young star AB
Dor, but higher than other single G/K stars. All our data show that this
single, late F-type star is actually a very active source, indirectly
confirming that this fast rotating star is probably a young object. In the
simultaneous fit of the ASCA+ROSAT data, a third temperature is required.
However this is not just an addition of a softer component, but is more a
redistribution of the dominant temperatures. Indeed, the range spanned by the
three temperatures, from 5 to 15 million degrees, is not very large.

the peak absolute magnitude of type Ia supernovae with their Hubble diagram,
(2) the distance to the Virgo cluster by six largely independent methods, and
(3) field spirals binned by luminosity class. The three methods give
H_0=56+/-3, 55+/-2, and 53+/-3 (internal errors). H_0 does not vary
significantly over scales from 10-500 Mpc.

small distance to the Virgo cluster, (2) an untenably large Virgo cluster
velocity, (3) a questionable route through the Coma cluster, (4) an incorrect
precept that the Cepheid distance to NGC 1365 gives the distance to NGC 1613,

hierarchical clustering. There is an initial epoch of $H_2$ production in the
gas phase through the $H^-$ route which ends at a redshift of order unity. Star
formation in the protogalactic disks can become self-regulated. The process
responsible for the feedback is heating of the gas by the internal stellar
radiation field which can dominate the background radiation field at various
epochs. It is possible to define a maximum star formation rate during this
epoch. Plausible estimates give a rate of 0.2-2 Mo yr-1 for condensations
corresponding to 1 sigma and 2 sigma initial density fluctuations. Therefore,
the production of metals and dust proceeds slowly in this phase. This moderate
epoch is terminated by a phase transition to a cold dense and warm
neutral/ionized medium once the metals and dust have increased to a level
Z=0.03-0.1 Z_o. Then: (1) atoms and molecules such as C, O and CO become
abundant and cool the gas to below $300 K$ ; (2) the dust abundance has become
sufficiently high to allow shielding of the molecular gas and; (3) molecular
hydrogen formation can occur rapidly on grain surfaces. This phase transition
occurs at a redshift of approximately 1.5, with a fiducial range of 1.2<z<2.

value (from 21 cm observations), a residual 2175 Angstrom absorption feature is
present. Additional de-reddening to correct the feature yields E(B-V)=0.07 mag
due to material outside our galaxy, most probably associated with the AGN or
its host galaxy. No other clear indications of reddening are observed in this

red-shift AGN could be incorrect if derived without UV observations of the
region near 2175 Angstrom in the AGN frame. After all reddening corrections are
performed, the log slope of H2106-099 from the near IR (~12500 Angstrom) to the
UV (~1400 Angstrom), -0.94 +/- 0.05, is steep compared to other AGN, suggesting
that the blue bump in this object is intrinsically weak. Weak blue bumps are,
therefore, not always an artifact caused by reddening.

chaotic on time scales greater than the ergodic time $\tau_{erg}$, which itself
is much smaller than the mean dwell time $\tau_{dwell}$. The excitation
spectrum of the Josephson junction has a gap $E_{gap}$, which can be less than
the gap $\Delta$ in the bulk superconductors. The average supercurrent is
computed in the ergodic regime $\tau_{erg} \ll \hbar/\Delta$, using
random-matrix theory, and in the non-ergodic regime $\tau_{erg} \gg
\hbar/\Delta$, using a semiclassical relation between the supercurrent and
dwell-time distribution. In contrast to conventional Josephson junctions,
raising the temperature above the excitation gap does not necessarily lead to
an exponential suppression of the supercurrent. Instead, we find a temperature
regime between $E_{gap}$ and $\Delta$ where the supercurrent decreases
logarithmically with temperature. This anomalously weak temperature dependence
is caused by long-range correlations in the excitation spectrum, which extend
over an energy range $\hbar/\tau_{erg}$ greater than $E_{gap} \simeq
\hbar/\tau_{dwell}$. A similar logarithmic temperature dependence of the

possible. This determination has reopened the debate on the value of this
fundamental coupling constant of nuclear physics. Precise measurements of
charge exchange observables at forward angles below 900 MeV/c would also give a
better understanding of the long range part of the two-pion exchange potential.
For example, the confirmation of the coherence of the tensor forces from the
pion exchange and the isovector two-pion exchange would be very valuable. With
the present data first attempts at an $\NbarN$ partial wave analysis have been
made where, as in nucleon nucleon scattering, the antinucleon nucleon high J
partial waves are mainly given by one-pion exchange. Finally a recent $\pbarp$
atomic cascade calculation and the fraction of P-state annihilation in gas

indecomposable representations of the Virasoro algebra are investigated, where
L_0 possesses a nontrivial Jordan decomposition. After studying `Jordan lowest

of a lowest weight module by another one, where again L_0 cannot be

the structure of the moduli space, very restrictive conditions on submodules of
`Jordan Verma modules' (the generalization of the usual Verma modules) are
derived. Furthermore, for any given lowest weight of a Jordan Verma module its
`maximal preserving submodule' (the maximal submodule, such that the quotient
module still is a Jordan lowest weight module) is determined. Finally, the
representations of the W-algebra W(2,3^3) at central charge c=-2 are
investigated yielding a rational logarithmic model.

the operational theory of quantum measurement. For an arbitrary quantum noise
leaking through the unused port of the beam splitter, the positive operator
valued measure and the corresponding operational homodyne observables are
derived. It is shown that such an eight-port homodyne device can be used to
construct the operational quantum trigonometry of an optical field. The quantum
trigonometry and the corresponding phase space Wigner functions are derived for
a signal field probed by a classical local oscillator and a squeezed vacuum in
the unused port.

A model is presented that should enable non-specialists as well as specialists
to understand how easy it is to find realistic explanations for the
observations. The model also suggests new areas where realistic
(``hidden-variable'') models can give valid predictions whilst quantum
mechanics fails. It offers straightforward explanations for some anomalies that
Aspect was unable to account for, providing perhaps the first experimental
evidence that a hidden-variable theory can be {\em superior} to quantum
mechanics. The apparent success of quantum mechanics in predicting results is
shown to be largely due to the use of unjustifiable and biased analysis of the
data. Data that has been discarded because it did not lead to a valid Bell's
test may give further evidence that hidden variables exist.
