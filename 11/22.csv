The gas is assumed to be isothermal with an effective sound speed c_s, and the
equations of motion are solved with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH).
Since the thermal energy in cloud random motions is negligible compared to the
orbital kinetic energy, no dependence of the flow on c_s is expected. However,
this is not the case when shocks are involved.
  For low values of c_s an open, off-axis shock flow forms that is
characteristic for potentials with an inner Lindblad resonance (ILR). Through
this shock the gas streams inwards from x_1 to x_2-orbits. At high sound speeds
the gas arranges itself in a different, on-axis shock flow pattern. In this
case, there is no gas on x_2-orbits, demonstrating that the gas can behave as
if there were no ILR. The critical effective sound speed dividing the two
regimes is in the range of values observed in the Milky Way.
  We give a heuristic explanation for this effect. A possible consequence is
that star formation may change the structure of the flow by which it was
initiated. Low-mass galaxies should predominantly be in the on-axis regime.
  A brief comparison of our SPH results with those from a grid-based
hydrodynamic code is also given.

study of the interaction of a rapidly rotating pulsar with time-variable

its most recent periastron passage (January 3-23, 1994). Unpulsed and
non-thermal hard X-ray emission was detected up to 200 keV, with a photon index
$1.8 \pm 0.2$ and a flux of ~4 mCrab, corresponding to a luminosity of a few
10^{34} erg/s at the distance of 2 kpc. The hard X-ray flux and spectrum
detected by CGRO agrees with the X-ray emission measured by simultaneous ASCA
observations. EGRET upper limits are significant, and exclude strong inverse
Compton cooling in the PSR B1259-63 system. We interpret the observed
non-thermal emission as synchrotron radiation of shocked electron/positron
pairs of the relativistic pulsar wind interacting with the mass outflow from
the Be star. Our results clearly indicate, for the first time in a binary
pulsar, that high energy emission can be shock-powered rather than caused by
accretion. The lack of X-ray/gamma-ray pulsations constrains models of
high-energy emission from rapidly rotating pulsars.

luminosity functions to those originally presented by Henry etal (1992); albeit
with two important differences. First, we show that the original low redshift

shape of our new determination of the high redshift EMSS luminosity function

quantified the degree of evolution seen in the X-ray cluster luminosity using

a group of seven clusters that were identified by the morphology of their LFs.
The LFs were derived using photometric data to a completeness limit ~5.5
magnitudes below M*. We found that a single Schechter function with an average
$\alpha \approx -1.0$ gives a good fit to these individual LFs within the
magnitude range. These seven clusters have common properties, which indicate
they form a homogeneous class of dynamically evolved clusters that can be
characterized by the presence of a dominant cD galaxy, high richness,
symmetrical single-peaked X-ray emission, and high gas mass. On the other hand,
steep faint-end slopes (-2.0 < \alpha < -1.4) are usually detected in poorer
clusters. Our result gives a direct indication that the faint-end slope of the
galaxy LF is subject to environmental effects. We propose that the flatness of
the faint-end slope in these clusters results from the disruption of a large
fraction of dwarf galaxies during the early stages of cluster evolution. The
stars and gas from the disrupted galaxies are redistributed throughout the
cluster potential during violent relaxation. This heuristic scenario can
explain the origin of the luminous haloes of cD galaxies and a large fraction
of the gas content in the intracluster medium as a by-product. The correlation
between the cluster gas mass determined from the modeling of the X-ray emission
and the cD halo optical luminosity is presented to support the proposed model.

the solar convection zone are able to extract angular momentum from the

assumptions: we ignore the Coriolis force, approximate the spectrum of
turbulent convection by the Kolmogorov law, and couple this turbulence to the
internal waves through their pressure fluctuations, following Press (1981) and
Garcia Lopez & Spruit (1991). The local frequency of an internal wave varies
with depth in a differentially rotating star, and it can vanish at some
location, thus leading to enhanced damping (Goldreich & Nicholson 1989). It is
this dissipation mechanism only that we take into account in the exchange of
momentum between waves and stellar rotation. The flux of angular momentum is
then an implicit function of depth, involving the local rotation rate and an
integral representing the cumulative effect of radiative dissipation. We find
that the efficiency of this transport process is rather high: it operates on a
timescale of 10^7 years, and is probably responsible for the flat rotation
profile which has been detected through helioseismology.

the magnetic correlations in the ground states in the SG phase are

rather, has a finite height V and a nonzero width xi and can be approximated as
parabolic near its peak. We develop a new treatment of the problem for g much
less than 1 that starts from the single-particle eigenstates for the full
coupled-dot system. The finiteness of the barrier leads to a small upward shift
of the f-versus-g curve at small values of g. The shift is a consequence of the
fact that the tunneling matrix elements vary exponentially with the energies of
the states connected. Therefore, when g is small, it can pay to tunnel to
intermediate states with single-particle energies above the barrier height V.
The correction to the zero-width behavior does not affect agreement with recent
experimental results but may be important in future experiments.

property of these transitions is that they are totally invisible in the double

analytically and to determine certain critical exponents is developed. It is
argued that phase transitions of this kind can be induced by the interaction of
two-dimensional vortices with curvature defects of a fluctuating random

earlier investigation of the deformations of quantum groups, in the category of
Hopf algebras, showed that quantum groups are generically rigid: Hopf algebra
deformations exist only under some restrictions on the parameters. In
particular, affine Kac-Moody algebras are more rigid than their loop algebra
quotients; and only the latter (in the case of sl(n)) can be deformed to
elliptic Hopf algebras. The generalization to quasi-Hopf deformations lifts
this restriction. The full elliptic quantum groups (with central extension)
