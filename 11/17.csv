a $B$-orbit in a product of flag varieties $(G/B)^l$. This also gives an
embedding of the projective coordinate ring of the variety into the function
ring of a Borel subgroup: $\CC[Z] \subset \CC[B]$.
  In the case of the general linear group $G = GL(n)$, this identifies $Z$ as a
configuration variety of multiple flags subject to certain inclusion
conditions, closely related to the the matrix factorizations of Berenstein,
Fomin and Zelevinsky. As an application, we give a geometric proof of the
theorem of Kraskiewicz and Pragacz that Schubert polynomials are characters of
Schubert modules.
  Our work leads on the one hand to a Demazure character formula for Schubert
polynomials and other generalized Schur functions, and on the other hand to a
Standard Monomial Theory for Bott-Samelson varieties.

scales as short as a few minutes, at least two orders of magnitude less than
for other Galactic or extragalactic water masers. The amplitude of one line
more than doubled in about 10 minutes. The intensity changes cannot be
attributed easily to a mechanism of intrinsic fluctuations. The variability may
be the result of strong interstellar diffractive scintillation along the line
of sight within our Galaxy, which would be the first example of diffractive
scintillation for any source at 22 GHz and for any source other than a pulsar.
However, only the very shortest timescales for interstellar scintillation,
obtained from pulsar observations and scaled to 22 GHz, correspond to the
observed maser variability. Alternatively, the intensity changes may be a
reaction to fluctuations in compact background or radiative pump sources and
thereby may be related to variability of the central engine. The maser spectral
features symmetrically bracket the systemic velocity of the galaxy, offset by
about +/-(100-200) km/s. The spectrum of the Circinus maser is similar in some
respects to that of the maser in NGC 4258, which probably traces a molecular
disk rotating around a supermassive object. VLBI observations could reveal
whether the maser source in the heart of the Circinus galaxy is part of a
similar dynamical system.

  Accepted for Astronomy & Astrophysics. See also astro-ph/9608128 and
  astro-ph/9611041",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We have developed a new procedure for the generation of a planetary nebula
luminosity function (PNLF), improving on previous work. The procedure is based,
as before, on an exponential central star mass distribution, on H-burning
post-AGB evolutionary tracks, and on the avoidance of nebular models for the
calculation of nebular fluxes. We have added new post-AGB evolutionary tracks
and introduced the following improvements: (1) the imperfect analytical
representation of post-AGB evolutionary tracks has been replaced by an
interpolation routine giving a better approximation; (2) we have modified the
distribution of the intensities of [O III] lambda 5007 relative to Hbeta, so
that it better imitates the observed distribution, which we have taken from
data in the Strasbourg-ESO catalogue of Galactic PNs and other sources; (3) we
have adjusted the absorbing factor mu along the white dwarf cooling tracks, so
as to reproduce the observed PNLF of the Magellanic Clouds and M 31 at fainter
magnitudes. In this way we have produced a PNLF which is more consistent with
observed PN properties. We use this randomly generated PNLF to: (1) show as
convincingly as possible that most PNs in any real population must leak stellar
H-ionizing photons; (2) revise our determinations of the parameter mu(max); (3)
discuss the shape of the PNLF, hinting at the possible existence of a distinct
feature 2 magnitudes fainter than the brightest PNs; (4) attempt estimates of
maximum final masses from fits to the PNLFs of the LMC and M 31. There is
marginal evidence of a higher maximum final mass in the LMC, but this should be
confirmed in other galaxies with recent star formation. A convincing
confirmation will require to increase the sample sizes and to extend the PNLFs
to at least 1.5 mag fainter than the brightest PNs.

the light curve: 0.0812585 day~1.95 hours and 0.0849767 d~2.04 hr. We establish
that the shorter periodicity is the orbital period of the underlying binary
system. The longer period oscillates with an average value of |dot(P)| ~
3x10^(7)--typical to permanent superhumps. The two periods obey the linear
relation between the orbital and superhump periods that holds among members of
the SU Ursae Majoris class of dwarf novae. A third periodicity of 0.083204
d~2.00 hr appeared in 1994 but not in 1995. It may be related to the recently
discovered anti-superhump phenomenon. These results suggest a linkage between
the classical nova V1974 Cyg and the SU UMa stars, and indicate the existence
of an accretion disk and permanent superhumps in the system no later than 30
months after the nova outburst. From the precessing disk model of the superhump
phenomenon we estimate that the mass ratio in the binary system is between 2.2
and 3.6. Combined with previous results this implies a white dwarf mass of
0.75-1.07 M sun.

implemented by changing the measure of integration from $\sqrt{-g}d^{D}x$ to an
integration in an internal space of $D$ scalar fields $\phi_{a}$. As a
consequence of such a choice of the measure, the matter Lagrangian $L_{m}$ can
be changed by adding a constant while no cosmological term is induced. Here we
develop this idea to build a new theory which is formulated through the first
order formalism, i.e. using vielbein $e_{a}^{\mu}$ and spin connection
$\omega_{\mu}^{ab}$ (a,b=1,2,...D) as independent variables. The equations
obtained from the variation of $e_{a}^{\mu}$ and the fields $\phi_{a}$ imply
the existence of a nontrivial constraint. This approach can be made consistent
with invariance under arbitrary diffeomorphisms in the internal space of scalar
fields $\phi_{a}$ (as well as in ordinary space-time), provided that the matter
model is chosen so as to satisfy the above mentioned constraint. If the matter
model is not chosen so as to satisfy automatically this constraint, the
diffeomorphism invariance in the internal space is broken. In this case the
constraint is dynamically implemented by the degrees of freedom that become
physical due to the breaking of the internal diffeomorphism invariance.
However, this constraint always dictates the vanishing of the cosmological
constant term and the gravitational equations in the vacuum coincide with
vacuum Einstein's equations with zero cosmological constant. The requirement
that the internal diffeomorphisms be a symmetry of the theory points towards
the unification of forces in nature like in the Kaluza-Klein scheme.
