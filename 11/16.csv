concentrated outer-halo globular cluster NGC 6229 is presented. The data
reduction in such a crowded field was based on a wavelet transform analysis.
Our larger dataset extends the previous results by Carney et al. (1991, AJ,
101, 1699) for the outer and less crowded fields of the cluster, and confirms
that NGC 6229 has a peculiar color-magnitude diagram for its position in the
Galaxy. In particular, NGC 6229's horizontal branch (HB) presents several
interesting features, among which stand out: a well populated and very extended
blue tail; a rather blue overall morphology, with (B-R)/(B+V+R) = 0.24+/-0.02;
a bimodal color distribution, resembling those found for NGC 1851 and NGC 2808;
and gaps on the blue HB. NGC 6229 is the first bimodal-HB cluster to be
identified in the Galactic outer halo. A low value of the R parameter is
confirmed, suggestive of a low helium abundance or of the presence of a quite
substantial population of extreme HB stars fainter than our photometric limit
(~ 2.5 mag below the RR Lyrae level in V). Twelve new possible variable stars
were found in the central part of the cluster. The morphology of the red giant
branch (RGB) also seems to be peculiar. In particular, the RGB luminosity
function ``bump'' is not a prominent feature and has only been tentatively
identified, on the basis of a comparison with a previously reported detection
for M3 (NGC 5272). Finally, we compare the properties of NGC 6229 with those
for other outer-halo globular clusters, and call attention to what appears to
be a bimodal HB distribution for the outer-halo cluster population, where
objects with very red or very blue HB types are much more frequently found than
clusters with intermediate HB types.

These massive systems were found by cross-correlating in position SIMBAD OB
star catalogues with the part of the ROSAT all-sky survey located at low
galactic latitudes (|b| < 20d) and selecting the early type stars which
apparently displayed the most significant excess of X-ray emission over the
`normal' stellar level. The present search is restricted to stars earlier than
B6 and X-ray luminosities > 10^31 erg/s. Follow-up optical and X-ray
observations allowed to remove misidentified OB stars and spurious matches with
interloper X-ray emitters (mostly active coronae) leaving five very likely new
massive X-ray binaries. These new candidates have 0.1-2.4 keV un-absorbed
luminosities > 10^33 erg/s indicating an accreting neutron star or black hole.
On the average their soft X-ray luminosities are comparable to those observed
from hard X-ray transients in quiescence or from persistent low luminosity
Be/X-ray sources. Two additional X-ray binary candidates require further
confirmation of their X-ray excess. Their lower soft X-ray luminosities (1-5
10^32 erg/s) could qualify them as Be + accreting white dwarf systems.

dispersion is roughly an order of magnitude larger compared to giant molecular

200 km/s. These clouds are connected, in the l-v plane, to high velocity ridges
that extend over several degrees of the longitude. These properties, we

a new way to model conditional independence in Markov models. The central
feature of our nonuniform Markov model is that it makes predictions of varying

Journal reveal that the nonuniform model performs slightly better than the
classic interpolated Markov model. This result is somewhat remarkable because
both models contain identical numbers of parameters whose values are estimated

solutions which are consistent with the semi-classical limit, $\hbar\rightarrow
0$, and the known time delays for a classical two soliton interaction. This is
done by a `$q$-deformation' procedure, to move from the classical time delay to
the exact S-matrix, by inserting a special function called the `regularised'
quantum dilogarithm, which only holds when $|q|=1$. It is then checked that the
solutions satisfy the crossing, unitarity and bootstrap constraints of S-matrix
theory. These properties essentially follow from analogous properties satisfied
by the classical time delay. Furthermore, the lowest mass breather S-matrices
are computed by the bootstrap, and it is shown that these agree with the
particle S-matrices known already in the affine Toda field theories, in all

model framework. A complete strangeness-changing weak $\Lambda N \to NN$
transition potential, based on one boson exchange, is constructed by including
the exchange of the pseudoscalar mesons $\pi$, K, $\eta$ as well as the vector
mesons $\rho, \omega$, and K$^*$, whose weak coupling constants are obtained
from soft meson theorems and SU(6)$_w$. General expressions for nucleons in
arbitrary shells are obtained. The transition matrix elements include realistic
$\Lambda$N short-range correlations and NN final state interactions based on
the Nijmegen baryon-baryon potential. The decay rates are found to be
especially sensitive to the inclusion of the strange mesons, K and K$^*$, even
though the role of kaon exchange is found to be reduced with recent couplings
obtained from next-to-leading order Chiral Perturbation Theory. With the weak
couplings used in this study the rates remain dominated by the pion-exchange
mechanism since the contributions of heavier mesons either cancel each other or
are suppressed by form factors and short-range correlations. The total decay
rate therefore remains in agreement with present measurements. However, the
partial rates which are even more sensitive to the inclusion of heavier mesons
cannot be reconciled with the data. The proton asymmetry changes by 50% once
heavier mesons are included and agrees with the available data.

in hot hadronic matter using an effective chiral Lagrangian. We find that
inelastic processes involving the vector and axial vector mesons reduce the
chemical equilibration time by a factor of $\sim 10$ compared to the result
previously calculated in chiral perturbation theory. For a temperature of
$T\sim 150 MeV$ we obtain a chemical relaxation time of $\tau_{ch} \simeq 10
fm/c$, which is comparable with typical time scales for a hadronic system
generated in SPS-energy heavy ion collisions. The effect of baryons is also
estimated and found to be negligible for SPS-energies but important for
AGS-energies. We predict, that chemical freeze-out should take place at
considerable higher temperatures $\Delta T \simeq 20 MeV$ than thermal
freeze-out and that the hadronic phase would not sustain a pion chemical
potential larger than $100 MeV$.

water. The macroscopic expression of the contrasting entropic behavior between
water and common organic solvents is the relative temperature insensitivity of
the water isothermal compressibility. The information theory model provides a
quantitative description of small molecule hydration and predicts a negative
entropy at convergence. Interpretations of entropic contributions to protein
folding should account for this result.

Quantum error correction suggests the possibility of achieving this, but only
if the recovery network can suppress more noise than it introduces. A general
method of constructing such networks is proposed, which gives a substantial
improvement over previous fault tolerant designs. The construction permits
quantum error correction to be understood as essentially quantum state
synthesis. An approximate analysis implies that algorithms involving very many
computational steps on a quantum computer can thus be made possible.
