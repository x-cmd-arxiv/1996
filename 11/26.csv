power law with slope of -1.52 +/- 0.03 and a correlation length of s_0 = (6.28

larger scales, xi(s) fluctuates closely about zero, indicating a high level of
uniformity in the galaxy distribution on these scales. In addition, two aspects
of the LCRS selection criteria - a variable field-to-field galaxy sampling rate
and a 55 arcsec galaxy pair separation limit - are tested and found to have
little impact on the measurement of xi(s). Finally, the LCRS xi(s) is compared

redshift-space distortions in the LCRS xi(s) will likely provide a strong test

which is only 3% of the current estimate of the local mass density of the MACHO

investigated. The analysis assumes the presence of CP violating $Zq\bar qG$
couplings. The contribution of these couplings to the $Z\rightarrow q\bar qG$
decay width is calculated for different cut algorithms, including nonzero quark
masses. Various CP--odd observables are discussed and it is shown that their
sensitivity can change significantly if one uses normalized or unnormalized
momentum vectors for their construction. Optimal observables are proposed which
allow to measure the new couplings simultaneously.

mass, namely when the chiral symmetry is exact, the phase transition becomes a
weak first order accompanying a gap in the order parameter as a function of
temperature. This is caused by the long range fluctuations of meson fields
whose effective masses become small in the transition region. It is shown,
however, that with an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term in the Lagrangian
which generates the realistic finite pion mass the transition is smoothed out

impression by violating several of the simple ``rules of thumb''. This is
relevant because decoherence is now beginning to be tested experimentally, and
