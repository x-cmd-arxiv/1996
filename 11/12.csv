operator $U_p$ on the space of cuspidal modular forms of level $pN$ and weight
two is semi-simple. It follows from this that the Hecke algebra acting on the
space of weight two forms of level $M$ is reduced if $M$ is cube free. Assuming
Tate's conjecture for cycles on smooth projective varieties over finite fields,
we generalize these results to higher weights. The main point in the proof is
that the crystalline Frobenius of the reduction mod $p$ of the motive
associated to a newform of level prime to $p$ and weight at least two cannot be
a scalar. Assuming Tate's conjecture, it follows that Ramanujan's inequality is
strict. For $N$ prime, we relate the discriminant of the weight two Hecke
algebra to the height of the modular curve $X_0(N)$, for which we get an upper
bound.

the tidal shocks and dynamical friction. Our simple model explains, on a

for the luminosity function of globular clusters with the assumption that the
initial luminosity function is identical in all galaxies (and we can test this

distribution of absolute magnitudes and compare it with the observed
distribution of apparent magnitudes to estimate the distance moduli for M31 and

angular scales \theta \simeq 1'-3 degrees and for alternative normalizations of
the power spectrum, in order to explore the best strategy for constraining the
cosmological parameters. Normalizing to observed cluster abundance the rms
amplitude of ellipticity within a 15' radius is \simeq 0.01 z_s^{0.6}, almost
independent of the cosmological model, with z_s being the median redshift of
background galaxies.
  Nonlinear effects in the evolution of the power spectrum significantly
enhance the ellipticity for \theta < 10' -- on 1' the rms ellipticity is \simeq
0.05, which is nearly twice the linear prediction. This enhancement means that
the signal to noise for the ellipticity is only weakly increasing with angle
for 2'< \theta < 2 degrees, unlike the expectation from linear theory that it
is strongly peaked on degree scales. The scaling with cosmological parameters
also changes due to nonlinear effects. By measuring the correlations on small
(nonlinear) and large (linear) angular scales, different cosmological
parameters can be independently constrained to obtain a model independent
estimate of both power spectrum amplitude and matter density \Omega_m.
Nonlinear effects also modify the probability distribution of the ellipticity.
Using second order perturbation theory we find that over most of the range of
interest there are significant deviations from a normal distribution.

residuals from the L-alpha relation of LP are significantly correlated with the
X-ray luminosity of the cluster at the 99.6% confidence level, in the sense
that more X-ray luminous clusters have brighter BCGs. The strength of this
correlation increases with increasing X-ray luminosity and with increasing
values of alpha. We obtain a new distance indicator for BCGs, the L-alpha-L_X
relation. Applying this new relation to our sample, we find that the frame
defined by these clusters has a bulk motion of 494 km/s in the CMB frame but
the 95% confidence range on the amplitude is 306 to 1419 km/s. These results
are inconsistent with this frame being at rest in the CMB frame at the 98.6%
confidence level. For the outer shell subsample (57 BCGs with cz > 6000 km/s),
the bulk motion is consistent both with no motion in the CMB frame and with the
motion found by LP. However, our analysis of the 107 Lauer and Postman BCGs in
this outer shell indicates that, even with no X-ray correction, the CMB-frame
bulk motion of these clusters is not statistically different from zero.
Furthermore, for the subsample with X-ray data, the X-ray correction goes in
the sense of reducing both the amplitude (by 663 km/s) and significance (from
98.8% to 83.8%) of its CMB-frame bulk motion, as well as reducing the internal
inconsistency between its motion and that of the remainder of the Lauer and

efficient in upscattering photons than thermal Comptonization in the range of
non-relativistic electron temperatures. The spectrum observed at infinity is a
power law with an exponential turnover at energies of order the electron rest
mass. Especially in the case of accretion into a black hole, the spectral
energy power-law index is distributed around 1.5. Because bulk motion near the
horizon (1-5 Schwarzschild radii) is most likely a necessary characteristic of

possible to determine the initial radius and mass and a parameter contained in
the theory. In the scalar-tensor theories, it would be possible to get the

limit of the dispersion relations following from an effective quark propagator
obtained from resumming one-loop self energy diagrams in the hard dense loop

strange quark matter as an ideal Fermi gas of quasiparticles. Within this
approach we find that medium effects reduce the overall binding energy with
respect to $^{56}Fe$ of strange quark matter. For realistic values of the
strong coupling constant strange quark matter is not absolutely stable. The
application to pure strange quark matter stars shows that medium effects have,
nevertheless, no impact on the mass-radius relation of the stars. However, a

simple perfect fluid due to the effect of vorticity quantisation, which gives
rise to a substructure of cosmic string type line defects that results in a

descriptions of this effect have been restricted to a non-relativistic
framework that is adequate for the treatment of liquid helium in a laboratory
context, the present work provides a fully relativistic description of the kind
required for application to rotating neutron star models. To start with, the
general category of vortex fibration models needed for this purpose is set up
on the basis of a Kalb-Ramond type variational principle. The appropriate
specification of the particular model to be chosen within this category will
ultimately be governed by the conclusions of microscopic investigations that
have not yet been completed, but the results available so far suggest that a
uniquely simple kind of model with an elegant dilatonic formulation should be
tentatively adopted as a provisional choice so long as there is no indication

In this paper the proposal is made explicit by developing the construction of
Wakimoto realizations from a simple but unconventional viewpoint. An explicit
formula is derived for the Wakimoto current first at the Poisson bracket level
by Hamiltonian symmetry reduction of the WZNW model. The quantization is then
performed by normal ordering the classical formula and determining the required
quantum correction for it to generate $\widehat{\cal G}_K$ by means of
commutators. The affine-Sugawara stress-energy tensor is verified to have the
expected quadratic form in the constituents, which are symplectic bosons
belonging to ${\cal G}_+$ and a current belonging to ${\cal G}_0$. The
quantization requires a choice of special polynomial coordinates on the big
cell of the flag manifold $P\backslash G$. The effect of this choice is
investigated in detail by constructing quantum coordinate transformations.
Finally, the explicit form of the screening charges for each generalized
Wakimoto realization is determined, and some applications are briefly
discussed.

Schrodinger equation that gives a dynamical account of the transformation of
entangled into factorized states and is consistent both with quantum mechanics
and required symmetries. The noisy, non-linear term is a unimodular scalar
multiple of the time reversal operator that must be present whenever a
Hamiltonian term in the Schrodinger equation can distinguish the factorized
constituents of an entangled state. The dynamical mechanism involved in the
transformation of entangled into factorized states provides an explanation for
the fact that Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations appear in a time determined
by the response of the measuring device and independent of the distance between
the particles. The dependence on the response time of the measuring device may
be testable through a delay in observing the collapse of mesoscopic
``Schrodinger cat"" states in ion traps. It is further shown that there are
situations where a two-particle interaction can induce a non-linear term by
virtue of coupling to decay modes that distinguish factorized constituents of
an entangled state. We show that this should happen in the neutral K-meson
system where the entangled $K_L$ state is pushed slightly in the direction of a
factorized constituent ($K_o$ or $\overline{K_o}$) as a consequence of the fact
that these can be distinguished via the sign of the charged lepton in a
semi-leptonic decay mode. The result is a CP violation that is within 20% of
the experimental value.
