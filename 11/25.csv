quasars is investigated using a new, complete sample of low-frequency-selected
quasars, the Molonglo Quasar Sample (MQS). The optical continuum is found to be
highly anisotropic, brightening continuously from lobe- to core-dominated
quasars by 3-5 mag. It is argued that aspect-dependent extinction, rather than
relativistic boosting as has been previously proposed, provides the simplest
explanation consistent with the data. The reddening hypothesis is supported by
both the steeper optical slopes and the larger Balmer decrements found in
lobe-dominated quasars, as well as the stronger anisotropy seen at blue
wavelengths. The dust responsible is shown to be physically associated with the
quasar, lying mostly at radii between the broad and narrow-line regions in a
clumpy distribution. Such a geometry is reminiscent of a torus. However,
substantial numbers of dust clouds must lie within the torus opening angle,
contributing to an increasing average optical depth with increasing viewing
angle away from the jet axis.

properties, of grains responsible for the 2175 angstrom interstellar extinction
feature (interstellar UV bump) are discussed. These constraints are based on
the observation that the peak position of the interstellar UV feature is very
stable (variations <~1%), that the large variations in width (<~25%) are
uncorrelated with the peak position except for the widest bumps, and that the
shape of the feature is described extremely well by a Drude profile. The UV
extinction of small graphite grains is computed for various clustering models
involving Rayleigh spheres. It is shown that compact clusters qualitatively
satisfy the above observational constraints, except that the peak position
falls at the wrong wavelength. As an alternative to graphite to model the
optical properties of the interstellar UV feature carrier, a single-Lorentz
oscillator model is considered, in conjunction with a clustering model based on
clusters of spheres. Intrinsic changes in the peak position and width are
attributed to variations in chemical composition of the grains, impacting upon
the parameters of the Lorentz oscillator. Further broadening is attributed to
clustering. These models are shown to satisfy the above observational
constraints. Furthermore, the correlated shift of peak position with increased
width, observed for the widest interstellar UV features, is reproduced. Models
involving a second Lorentz oscillator to reproduce the FUV rise are also
considered. The impact of this extra Lorentz oscillator on the peak position,
width, and shape of the bump is investigated. Synthetic extinction curves are
generated to model actual ones exhibiting a wide range of FUV curvatures.
Physical mechanisms which might be of relevance to explain the variations of
these optical properties are discussed.

populations within the cluster must have distributions in velocity and position

average, a factor of $2.05 \pm 0.34$ smaller than that of the blue population.
The red galaxies also have a smaller RMS velocity dispersion, a factor of $1.31

blue galaxies is $3.5 \pm 1.3$ times larger than from the red galaxies.
However, applying the Jeans equation of stellar-hydrodynamical equilibrium to

constructed. We consider disordered environment that may be either static

constitutes formally a special case where the disorder auto-correlation length
is taken to be infinite. Alternatively, localization problem is obtained if the
noise auto-correlation time is taken to be infinite. Also the general case of
weak nonlinear coupling to thermal, possibly chaotic bath is handled by the
same formalism. A general, Feynman-Vernon type path-integral expression for the
propagator is introduced. Wigner transformed version of this expression is
utilized in order to facilitate comparison with the classical limit. It is
demonstrated that non-stochastic genuine quantal manifestations are associated
with the new model. It is clarified that such effects are absent in the
standard BM model, either the disorder or the chaotic nature of the bath are
essential. Quantal correction to the classical diffusive behavior is found even
in the limit of high temperatures. The suppression of interference due to
dephasing is discussed, leading to the observation that due to the disorder the
decay of coherence is exponential in time, and no longer depends on geometrical
considerations. Fascinating non-Markovian effects due to time-correlated
(colored) noise are explored. For this, a new strategy is developed in order to
handle the integration over paths. This strategy is extended in order to
demonstrate how localization comes out from the path integral expression.

table. Both are considered with and without initial quark gluon plasma
formation. In each case the initial temperature is fixed by requiring
$dN_{ch}/dy \sim$ 550 in the final state. It is shown that most observables are
very sensitive to the equation of state. This is particularly evident when
comparing the results of the simplified equation of state in the scenarios with
and without phase transition. The hadronic gas scenario leads to a
substantially higher rate for the $p_T$-distribution of all particles. In the
complete equation of state with several hundreds of hadronic resonances, the
difference between the scenarios with and without phase transition is rather
modest. Both photon and particle spectra, in a wide $p_T$ range, show very
similar behavior. It is therefore concluded that from the $p_T$ spectra it will
be hard to disentangle quark gluon plasma formation in the initial state. It is
to be stressed however, that there are conceptual difficulties in applying a
pure hadronic gas equation of state at SPS-energies. The phase transition
scenario with a quark gluon plasma present in the initial state seems to be the
more natural one.

methods and boson realizations are also explored in several contexts. So, a
class of two-boson representations for the non-standard deformation of
$sl(2,\R)$ is introduced and contracted to the non-standard quantum (1+1)
Poincar\'e representations. Likewise, a quantum extended Hopf $sl(2,\R)$
algebra is constructed and the Jordanian $q$-oscillator algebra representations
are obtained from it by means of another contraction procedure.

channel. We present the optimal strategy for an eavesdropper restricted to a
two-dimensional probe, interacting on-line with each transmitted signal. The
link between safety of the transmission and the violation of Bell's inequality
is discussed. We also use a quantum copying machine for eavesdropping and for
broadcasting quantum information.

  Condensation of a weakly interacting Bose gas without a trapping potential","37 pages, 4 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.55.2902",,"quant-ph",,"  A Quantum Kinetic Master Equation (QKME) for bosonic atoms is formulated. It
is a quantum stochastic equation for the kinetics of a dilute quantum Bose gas,
and describes the behavior and formation of Bose condensation. The key
assumption in deriving the QKME is a Markov approximation for the atomic
collision terms. In the present paper the basic structure of the theory is
developed, and approximations are stated and justified to delineate the region
of validity of the theory. Limiting cases of the QKME include the Quantum
Boltzmann master equation and the Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation, as well as an
equation analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

  Review A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.55.1665",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider a driven damped anharmonic oscillator which classically leads to
a bistable steady state and to hysteresis. The quantum counterpart for this
system has an exact analytical solution in the steady state which does not
display any bistability or hysteresis. We use quantum state diffusion theory to
describe this system and to provide a new perspective on the lack of hysteresis
in the quantum regime so as to study in detail the quantum to classical
transition. The analysis is also relevant to measurements of a single
periodically driven electron in a Penning trap where hysteresis has been
observed.
