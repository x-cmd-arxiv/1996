  with internal Capacitance","41 pages, TeX file with 9 EPSI figures (need psfig to include)",,,,"adap-org nlin.AO",,"  A mystery surrounds the stability properties of the splay-phase periodic
solutions to a series array of N Josephson junction oscillators. Contrary to
what one would expect from dynamical systems theory, the splay state appears to
be neutrally stable for a wide range of system parameters. It has been
explained why the splay state must be neutrally stable when the
Stewart-McCumber parameter beta is zero. In this paper we complete the
explanation of the apparent neutral stability; we show that the splay state is
typically hyperbolic -- either asymptotically stable or unstable -- when beta >
0. We conclude that there is only a single unit Floquet multiplier, based on
accurate and systematic computations of the Floquet multipliers for beta
ranging from 0 to 10. However, N-2 multipliers are extremely close to 1 for
beta larger than about 1. In addition, two more Floquet multipliers approach 1
as beta becomes large. We visualize the global dynamics responsible for these
nearly degenerate multipliers, and then estimate them accurately by a multiple
time-scale analysis. For N=4 junctions the analysis also predicts that the
system converges toward either the in-phase state, the splay state, or two
clusters of two oscillators, depending on the parameters.

X-ray properties (L_X) of the clusters with virial temperature estimates (T_v)
from the lensing shear strength, we find little evidence for evolution in the
L_X-T_v relation from that observed for local clusters. We discuss how this
observation constrains models for the X-ray evolution of clusters. The data
have also been used to study the color dispersion of bona-fide ellipticals in
high-z clusters: we find the spread to be very small, suggesting an early
formation epoch for the stellar populations of cluster ellipticals. This is
consistent with the evolution of the morphology-density relationship, in which
we find ellipticals to be as abundant at z=0.5 as in clusters today, and
already well ensconced in the dense regions. In contrast, S0's are less
plentiful and less well-concentrated compared to the present epoch, and spiral
galaxies everywhere more abundant. Combined with other spectroscopic and
morphological data, these observations suggest that most of these rapidly
evolving systems are not likely to become bright ellipticals, which were more
likely formed at early epochs. Cluster S0 galaxies, on the other hand, are
likely to have been produced in large numbers in the recent past.

orbit with a massive B-star companion, indicate that the system's orbital
period is decreasing on a timescale of $\approx 5 \times10^{5}$ years, which is
much shorter than the timescale of $\approx$ 10^9 years given by the standard
theory of tidal dissipation in radiative stars. Observations also provide
strong evidence that the B-star is rotating rapidly, perhaps at nearly its
break up speed. We show that the dissipation of the dynamical tide in a star
rotating in the same direction as the orbital motion of its companion (prograde
rotation) with a speed greater than the orbital angular speed of the star at
periastron results in an increase in the orbital period of the binary system
with time. Thus, since the observed time derivative of the orbital period is
large and negative, the B-star in the PSR J0045-7319 binary must have
retrograde rotation if tidal effects are to account for the orbital decay. We
also show that the time scale for the synchronization of the B-star's spin with
the orbital angular speed of the star at periastron is comparable to the
orbital evolution time. From the work of Goldreich and Nicholson (1989) we
therefore expect that the B-star should be rotating differentially, with the
outer layers rotating more slowly than the interior. We show that the
dissipation of the dynamical tide in such a differentially rotating B-star is
enhanced by almost three orders of magnitude leading to an orbital evolution
time for the PSR J0045-7319 Binary that is consistent with the observations.

have their frequencies in the local rest frame of the star Doppler shifted by
different amounts. This leads to a difference in their local dissipation rate

soft X-ray transients (SXTs), V404 Cyg, A0620-00, GS2000+25, Nova Mus 1991, and
Cen X-4. Since Li is likely to be depleted in stars of this type, the origin of
the Li is puzzling. Li has not been seen in similar secondaries of cataclysmic
variables, which suggests that the high Li abundance is not due to an anomalous
suppression of Li depletion in close binaries. SXTs in the quiescent state have
hot advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) in which the ions are
essentially at virial temperature. At such temperatures, Li production via
$\alpha-\alpha$ spallation is possible. We show that quiescent SXTs can produce
sufficient Li via spallation to explain the observations in V404 Cyg, A0620-00,
GS2000+25, and Nova Mus 1991. Depending on the Li depletion time scale in the
secondary, which may range between $10^7-10^9$ yr, the model requires $\sim
10^{-4}-10^{-6}$ of the accreted mass to be intercepted by the secondary after
undergoing Li production and being ejected. In the case of Cen X-4, we can
explain the observed Li only if the mass accretion rate is $\sim 10^{-3}$ times
the Eddington rate and if there is enhanced ejection due to a propeller effect.
We discuss possible observational tests of this proposal. Li production during
outbursts could be quite important and may even dominate over the production
during quiescence, but the estimate of the Li yield is uncertain. We calculate
the expected luminosity in gamma-ray lines due to the production of excited Li
and Be nuclei, but conclude that the line cannot be detected with current

redshift of 2.369. The Ly$\alpha$ line has a square- bottomed profile
suggesting a high column density of gas, yet the line does not reach zero
intensity. The resolved C IV doublet ratio also clearly demonstrates that the
absorbing clouds at this redshift do not fully occult the background light
source along our line-of-sight.
  The absorption lines are positioned near the centers of the broad emission-
lines and the coverage fraction of the strongest absorption lines varies
inversely proportionally with the strength of the corresponding emission lines.
This implies that although the absorption-line region may obscure the continuum
source, it does not completely occult the broad emission-line region. This
effect suggests that the lines are formed close to the QSO central region. A
model is proposed in which the apparent coverage fraction derived for the
weaker absorption lines may vary with the column density of the lines.
  Broad absorption-lines (which are known to be intrinsic) are found nearly
exclusively in radio-quiet objects. Intrinsic narrow absorption lines have
previously been found in radio quiet QSOs; it is therefore significant that an
intrinsic absorption system has been verified in a radio loud quasar.

specific dependences on the shape of the quadrangle formed by the four

  When averaged at a given scale, the four-point function, that identifies with

that non-zero momentum be transferred to the proton, off-forward gluon
