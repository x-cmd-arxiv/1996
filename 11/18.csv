with unprecedented accuracy - in principle. To achieve this in practice when
faced with such gigantic data sets, elaborate data analysis methods are needed
to make it computationally feasible. An important step in the data pipeline is
to make a map, which typically reduces the size of the data set my orders of
magnitude. We compare ten map-making methods, and find that for the Gaussian
case, both the method used by the COBE DMR team and various variants of Wiener
filtering are optimal in the sense that the map retains all cosmological
information that was present in the time-ordered data (TOD). Specifically, one
obtains just as small error bars on cosmological parameters when estimating
them from the map as one could have obtained by estimating them directly from
the TOD. The method of simply averaging the observations of each pixel (for
total-power detectors), on the contrary, is found to generally destroy
information, as does the maximum entropy method and most other non-linear
map-making techniques.
  Since it is also numerically feasible, the COBE method is the natural choice
for large data sets. Other lossless (e.g. Wiener-filtered) maps can then be
computed directly from the COBE method map.

interior rotation profile is determined by the redistribution of angular
momentum through the meridian circulation and through the shear turbulence
generated by the differential rotation; the possible effect of internal waves
is neglected. We examine the mixing of chemicals produced by the same internal
motions. Our modelization is based on the set of equations established by Zahn
(1992) and completed in Matias, Talon & Zahn (1996). Our calculations show that
the amount of mixing associated with a typical rotation velocity of $\sim 100
km/s$ yields stellar models whose global parameters are very similar to those
obtained with the moderate overshooting ($d/H_P \simeq 0.2$) which has been
invoked until now to fit the observations. Fast rotation ($\sim 300 km/s$)
leads to significant changes of the C/N and O/N surface ratios, but the
abundance of He is barely increased. The modifications of the internal
composition profile due to such rotational mixing will certainly affect the
post--main-sequence evolution.

(XRB), planetary nebulae, Herbig-Haro objects and in jets of active galactic
nuclei (AGN). For the prototypical XRB SS433 a kinematic model of precessing
jets has been applied very successfully and yielded a determination of its
distance which is independent of conventional methods. In galactic jets
precession appears to be the predominant mechanism for the production of
observed helical signatures. In extragalactic jets other mechanisms seem to be
similarly frequent. As a result of their strong dependence on the direction of
motion with respect to the observer, special relativistic effects can be
pronounced in helical jets. These have to be taken into account in AGN-jets and
the newly discovered galactic sources which show apparent superluminal motion.
Since the galactic superluminal jets are located in a binary system, jet
precession is very likely in these sources. In this paper I review the main
structural and kinematic signatures of helical jets and briefly mention the
physical mechanisms behind them. I will present kinematic simulations of
relativistic jets which are helically bent or have an internal helical flow
field.

planets ranging from Jupiter mass down to Earth mass. For a successful
detection of planets, it is necessary to accurately and frequently monitor a
microlensing event photometrically, once it has been ""triggered"".
  We present a large variety of two-dimensional magnification distributions for
systems consisting of an ordinary star and a planetary companion. We cover
planet/star mass ratios from $m_{pl}/M_* = 10^{-5}$ to $ 10^{-3}$. These limits
correspond roughly to $M_{Earth}$ and $M_{Jup}$, for a typical lens mass of
$M_* = 0.3 M_{\odot}$. We explore a range of star-planet distances, with
particular emphasis on the case of ""resonant lensing"", a situation in which the
planet is located at or very near the Einstein ring of the lensing star.
  We show a wide selection of light curves - one dimensional cuts through the
magnification patterns - to illustrate the broad range of possible light curve
perturbations caused by planets. The strongest effects are to be expected for
caustic crossings. But even tracks passing outside the caustics can have
considerable effects on the light curves. The easiest detectable (projected)
distance range for the planets is between about 0.6 and 1.6 Einstein radii.
Planets in this distance range produce caustics inside the Einstein ring of the
star. For a lensing star with a mass of about $0.3 M_{\odot}$ at a distance of
6 kpc and a source at 8 kpc, this corresponds to physical distances between
star and planet of about 1 to 3 AU.

those of 16 Cyg, we have established that the orbital eccentricity of the

even larger, with typical timescale of tens of millions years. The amplitude of
the planet eccentricity strongly depends on the relative inclination between
the plane of motion of the planet and that of the wide binary 16 Cyg AB. To
account for the present eccentricity of the planet we have to assume that the
angle between the two planes of motion is large, at least 60 deg. We argue that

except for the lowest m+1 states, if the superpotential is defined in terms of
the (m+1)-st eigenfunction, with m=0 reserved for the ground state. It is shown
that in case of the infinite 1-dim potential well nothing new emerges (the
partner potential is still of P\""oschl-Teller type I, for all m), whilst in
case of the 1-dim harmonic oscillator we get a new class of infinitely many
partner potentials: for each m the partner potential is expressed as the sum of
the quadratic harmonic potential plus rational function, defined as the
derivative of the ratio of two consecutive Hermite polynomials. These partner
potentials of course have m singularities exactly at the locations of the nodes
of the generating (m+1)-st wavefunction. The susy formalism applies everywhere

would naively expect. In the case of dynamical calculations with a time
dependent Hamiltonian we find two timescales determining the adiabaticity of
the propagation; these are the time required for adiabaticity in the single

  presented at the 28th Int. Conf. on H.E.P. in Warsaw",,,,"hep-th chao-dyn hep-lat hep-ph nlin.CD",,"  We discuss space-time chaos and scaling properties for classical non-Abelian
gauge fields discretized on a spatial lattice. We emphasize that there is a
``no go'' for simulating the original continuum classical gauge fields over a
long time span since there is a never ending dynamical cascading towards the
ultraviolet. We note that the temporal chaotic properties of the original
continuum gauge fields and the lattice gauge system have entirely different
scaling properties thereby emphasizing that they are entirely different
dynamical systems which have only very little in common. Considered as a
statistical system in its own right the lattice gauge system in a situation
where it has reached equilibrium comes closest to what could be termed a
``continuum limit'' in the limit of very small energies (weak non-linearities).
We discuss the lattice system both in the limit for small energies and in the
limit of high energies where we show that there is a saturation of the temporal
chaos as a pure lattice artifact. Our discussion focuses not only on the
temporal correlations but to a large extent also on the spatial correlations in
the lattice system. We argue that various conclusions of physics have been
based on monitoring the non-Abelian lattice system in regimes where the fields
are correlated over few lattice units only. This is further evidenced by
comparison with results for Abelian lattice gauge theory. How the real time
simulations of the classical lattice gauge theory may reach contact with the
real time evolution of (semi-classical aspects of) the quantum gauge theory
(e.g. Q.C.D.) is left as an important question to be further examined.

and it is known that they are as powerful as unrestricted computation. We study
the case where both noise and reversibility are combined and show that the
combined model is weaker than unrestricted computation. In our noisy reversible
circuits, each wire is flipped with probability p each time step, and all the
inputs to the circuit are present in time 0. We prove that any noisy reversible
circuit must have size exponential in its depth in order to compute a function
with high probability. This is tight as we show that any circuit can be
converted into a noise-resistant reversible one with a blow up in size which is
exponential in the depth. This establishes that noisy reversible computation
has the power of the complexity class NC^1.
  We extend this to quantum circuits(QC). We prove that any noisy QC which is
not worthless, and for which all inputs are present at time 0, must have size
exponential in its depth. (This high-lights the fact that fault tolerant QC
must use a constant supply of inputs all the time.) For the lower bound, we
show that quasi-polynomial noisy QC are at least powerful as logarithmic depth
QC, (or QNC^1). Making these bounds tight is left open in the quantum case.

study the slowdown of the simulation for two cases: (1) sequential quantum
computers, or quantum Turing machines(QTM), and (2) parallel quantum computers,
or quantum circuits. This paper shows that the computational power of decohered
quantum computers depends strongly on the amount of parallelism in the
computation.
  The expected slowdown of the simulation of a QTM is polynomial in time and
space of the quantum computation, for any non zero decoherence rate. This means
that a QTM subjected to any amount of noise is worthless. For decohered quantum
circuits, the situation is more subtle and depends on the decoherence rate,
eta. We find that our simulation is efficient for circuits with decoherence
rate higher than some constant, but exponential for general circuits with
decoherence rate lower than some other constant. Using computer experiments, we
show that the transition from exponential cost to polynomial cost happens in a
short range of decoherence rates, and exhibit the phase transitions in various
quantum circuits.
